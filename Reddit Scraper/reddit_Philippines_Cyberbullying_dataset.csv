How to report cyberbullying,Hellooo! Do you guys have any idea how to report cyberbullying? My friend from the EU is being scammed by Filipinos. His video was edited by the AI to make it seem like he was jerking off. He was threatened by them to send money or else they'll send it to everyone who knows him. Any idea how to report these scammers?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/131b1ju/how_to_report_cyberbullying/,t2_3kbtt7nh,2023-04-28 07:28:26,2
Cyberbullying sa Pinas,"Friends, sa internet age na to na madaming experts on everything, fanatics, hypersensitive, trolls, power tripper at iba pa, nakaranas na ba kayo or anyone close sainyo ng cyberbullying in any way?

Cyberbullying Advice,"I don't know if this is a valid topic to open, but I need to ask for legal specifics in the PH. Not advice, just clarifications.

I'm currently stuck in a cyberbullying shenanigan (I am the victim) against 5 people who purposefully screenshot my private information and spread it around. It mostly happens within their group chats. If for example, one of the people in those group chats gave full consent to me viewing the messages (they send me screenshots willingly), will that constitute as a breach of privacy according to PH regulations or anything of that sort?

I won't be taking legal action and I'm 100% sure they won't be as well, but just in case I decide to slap hard facts against them, I want to be sure that my intents won't backfire because of my knowledge regarding what goes on in their private group chats.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/ma14ek/cyberbullying_advice/,t2_2hmwwz1q,2021-03-22 01:09:50,0

PH Memes as a form of Cyberbullying,"Scrolling through my newsfeed in FB the past few days and I keep on seeing the “Kapatid Arlene/leeg” meme. For those of you who don’t know, Arlene was a girl joining INC and was asked up to when will she be a member of INC. Her friends were striking their necks to signal “until death” but she answered “hanggang leeg” instead. 

People made it into a meme and I keep on seeing it in my feed. It makes me sad to see this because I emphatize with Arlene. She was legitimately trying to answer the question but now she’s made fun of everywhere. Another thing that frustrates me is the people who use this meme are people who say that they advocate for mental health. Don’t they see that they might be affecting someone’s mental health with what they’re doing? 

I’ve been thinking about this for a long time even with the Jovit Baldivino basketball meme and Ed Caluag espiritista meme. 

Any thoughts on this issue?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/lpp2io/ph_memes_as_a_form_of_cyberbullying/,t2_6yrc6a4h,2021-02-22 22:19:37,3

Karamihan sa Top 16 are survivors (victims) of Cyberbullying. Do you think our online behavior this past few weeks had an effect sa naging resulta sa Miss Universe?,"I certainly don't believe na we are that special to be considered as a factor for someone's qualifications for beauty pageant, and also certainly the other contestants for miss universe are good, if not the best, and deserves to be in top 16.

It just that this past week, ive noticed how much we make fun of thailand and them to us, that it seems like we are pitting two queens against each other, and it doesn't reflect well to them.

Let's dig this up. Rappler has done so already, but it's not enough for some reason (*lack of virality*). We need to pool up resources. Documentaries? Infographics? Spread them out through Facebook. Pag-practisan ng awareness campaign.

Update 1: Is it really cyber bullying if we're just spreading truth?

Update 1.5: Backing off away from this for now. I've thought about this and all the articles merely state *accounts*. Commenters have made the point that if it was all factual, then they should have gone to jail for it already, and this won't do much legally.

Result we could get is cyberbullying. Libel. We can't get on top on this aside from a few hits here and there to make people aware of the issue, but that won't translate to any action.

"Libel should not be punishable with jail time, truth should be an absolute defense","It makes no sense to me that if you publicize someone’s crime and it’s true that they committed that crime, they can still sue you for libel and you can still go to jail for it because truth is not an absolute defense under Philippine law.

Remember that it was Sotto who inserted libel at the last minute in the cybercrime law. He did so after claiming to be “cyberbullied” due to his alleged plagiarism.

The prescription of 12 years (as they are claiming for Ressa’s case) is also pretty ridiculous. I think the 1-year prescription period in the original libel law was fair enough.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/artjfr/libel_should_not_be_punishable_with_jail_time/,t2_9bdnt,2019-02-18 13:05:06,5

I’ve been getting a lot of hate mail recently because I’ve criticized VP Leni Robredo.,"I’ve been getting a lot of hate mail recently because I’ve criticized VP Leni Robredo.

A lot of friends have told me how I am being tarred and feathered in other people’s walls and some of them have even shown me screen caps. Screen caps I don’t bother to look at.

And I don’t look at them because it doesn’t matter to me one bit what they say. The language of hate is wounding and I have more than enough wounds on my plate, thank you. If I’m going to get wounded at all, it’ll be by the hands of people who matter to me. Not strangers I care nothing for.

Also, I tell my friends there is no need to defend me. That that is all part and parcel of democracy. I love it when they do, yes but there is no pressing need to. I would rather they focus their time and energy on worthier pursuits like sex. (O diba, nagising kayo? :D)

But also, I have a deeper understanding of my freedom.

There is a price I pay for writing with the kind of freedom I do. And it is this—that I awaken the dirt in other people’s souls and they mistake their dirt for mine. And they will spit at me and throw stones at me and try to deny me my humanity and lie about me—and it will be for no other reason than because I spoke my truth. A truth they don’t share.

And how they would like nothing more than to silence me.

And the funny thing is some of the most vicious ones I’ve encountered are people who think themselves decent and moral and virtuous. Teachers, college professors, bankers, Jesuits, Ateneans, people who fancy themselves buddhists even.

There is someone connected with Ateneo—as what, I have no idea. I don’t know him/her. Yup, I don’t even know his/her gender.

But time and again, s/he’s tried to pit me against my sister. And her theme, according to friends who’ve told me about it is how so much better my sister is (because, presumably, they share the same political beliefs. Yup. Another lazy thinker..or does this person even think?) My sister is precious to me. And right now we are on shifty ground. There is some discord between me and my sisters because of politics.

This is a very long read so click the screenshot  http://imgur.com/a/aNh7p for the full FB post or go to FB os Sass because she shared this.

Name-calling as Deflection,"A friend who has been relentlessly cyberbullied for her political convictions just shared with me a Facebook post against her, which was both extremely cruel & violent.

This has become the norm since July 2016. When you disagree with the president or his administration, his supporters are waiting in the wings to pounce with an unheard of vehemence. Threats ranging from rape & murder to insults that will make you think twice about looking in the mirror is their modus operandi of choice.

In the beginning, most of us were either shocked into silence or baited into battling them in their cuss-infected territory. But this approach can only get them so far.

Would you have been a gentleman and stand up to let a women sit in your seat?,"If you've been following this incident on social media then you know what I'm talking. Basically, a woman supposedly posted a picture of a man on social media and basically insulted him for not standing up to let her sit in his seat on the train. Now there's a back and forth between those who are angry at the girl for being demanding and cyberbullying the guy but there are also those who support her and say chivalry is dying or already dead in the Philippines. So my question to you is, would you have stood up?

My take on this is that, me as a man raised in a family of service men and women, I would have stood up and offered my seat. I think it really comes down to, not only how we were raised but also how you are as a person. Point blank, at the end of the day everyone gets tired and just wants to relax. That guy on the train might have been exhausted from a long day and reality is he might not be the type of person to give up his seat on the train for someone. That does not make him a bad person though. Nobody has the time to really dig into the man's state of mind and his family background. 

The lesson that should be learned here is that we should never resort to shaming someone because of actions that, in reality, didn't harm us in any way. Was the girl wrong for shaming him, I can honestly say yes. Am I surprised she did, not at all. Some women have grown accustomed to being treated like a lady and there's nothing wrong with that. Maybe she's had seats offered to her several times and she thought that was the norm.

* Duterte supporters and Davao Death Squad members are cyberbullying the two USA senators, Leila De Lima, Ninoy Aquino, Martial Law victims, LGBTQ supporters, LGBTQ people, Leni Robredo and Aquino supporters; those dectrators may brand them as yellowtards or dilawan.
* Marcos Loyalists are praising Duterte, and possibly Jinping by keeping USA army at bay.
* Duterte Supporters and Marcos Loyalists want to urge PH government and military to impose the harshest PH visa to all foreigners to enter the Philippines, in the most brutal fashion, with Gov't, state and military approval by chance and  they will ONLY allow Filipinos to leave PH with their approval by chance unless they get detained by police/military by brute force and without warrant, and no equality and fairness. Filipinos in other countries would be branded as defectors like North Korean defectors in outside countries.
* Philippines may not just be a sovereign country but it might be also self-reliant, (just) like (in) North Korea, to expel and repel foreigners, foreign investors, tourists and products.
* It will not be liberalism and globalism but it would be ultranationalism, chauvunism and jingoism with government and state propaganda to be circulated at future supreme Filipino Leader like of Marcos dynasty.
* Sad to say that Philippines may have a totalitarian military state where the president has absolute power along with the military and he (and they) could completely control both public and private aspects.
* Private companies, vehicles and housing would be confiscated. And ABS-CBN, GMA and others may face risk of being closed down.
* There will be no more free internet. Only government, state and military will take control over the Philippine internet. The internet will be pure propaganda and it would be used with authority.
* Philippines itself will be isolated completely from any outside countries. Look what happened to North Korea! it will be the hardest country and it may disappear and cease to exist in few thousand years from now...
* North Korea may send out its nuclear missiles to wipe out USA, Canada, Europe, Australia, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.
* Worst thing is that PH economy will be in shambles in many years without any outside support of outside country. And it will be more prone to supertyphoons and earthquakes without any foreign aid to save. Foreign tourists will decline and fade to nothing. Because of this, Philippines may adopt Cultural Revolution and new constitution that would be a great leap backwards!
* Philippines would fire up discrimination, homophobia, xenophobia, racism, inequality and sexism against foreign countries, tourists or so.

This is really NO joke! Hindi natutuwa ito! Subukan na ito!!!

Everything that's wrong with Facebook in the Philippines,"#1. Facebook has been using its community standards in favor of bullying, and other types of misbehavior.  

Author Miguel Syjuco said: 

>None of my many reports on these acts of aggression were judged valid by Facebook; they constantly informed me that each did not violate any of their community standards. And so continue the habitual waves of followers led to my page by propagandists and influencers who attack me for holding a different political perspective.

>And that’s what makes the Gaylord situation weird. The double standard has become quite clear.

>After I posted my explanation about why I blocked him, he began attacking some of my Facebook friends. They conveyed to me his threats to report me for cyberbullying, which struck me as absurdly ironic.

>Shortly after, Facebook deleted my first post in which I’d explained that I blocked him for being a “belligerent asshole,” and urged my readers to leave him alone. Not long later, Facebook also deleted my second post, in which I had complained about the company’s double standard in never pursuing attacks against me, while so readily penalizing me for posting a screencap in which Gaylord had warned my friend “to be careful,” called him a “faggot,” and said “if you want to pick a fight with me stop hitting those keys and let’s get it on.” Gaylord’s inclusion of smiley emojis only heightened the menace of his threats.

#With my two posts deleted, my access was then [suspended for 24 hours.](https://www.esquiremag.ph/politics/opinion/miguel-syjuco-on-facebook-a2129-20180131-lfrm2)

#2. But takes down perfectly legit posts. By legit, I mean it is not one of the things listed as violations of its community standards.  

Such as this supposed [compromise deal between the Duterte administration and the Marcoses.](http://technology.inquirer.net/71044/senate-probe-facebooks-taking-posts-violating-community-standards)

>Recently, viral posts of alternative educator Gang Badoy and newspaper columnist Tonyo Cruz were taken down by Facebook after purportedly violating the social media site’s community standards. Facebook later restored the posts after it issued an apology, saying an employee accidentally removed the posts.

#3. It helped win elections.

>According to Facebook’s estimates, people from the Philippines ranked the second highest (1,175,870) next to the United States (70,632,350), followed by Indonesia (1,096,666), then the United Kingdom (1,079,031) as the most affected by Cambridge Analytica’s data mining operations.

>The parent company of Cambridge Analytica helped put Philippines’ leader Rodrigo Duterte into office after already influencing voters in dozens of campaigns across the globe, according to media reports and information pulled from the firm’s website.

#4. With algorithms that can be used for evil.

From [How Facebook algorithms impact democracy](https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/148536-facebook-algorithms-impact-democracy)

>With 1.7 billion active monthly users worldwide, Facebook is effectively the world’s largest news source, the umbrella organization where nearly all news content flows.

>Its algorithms decide what you see on your feed.

------------------

>Facebook's algorithms, created in a black box, are extremely powerful in shaping reality and creating echo chambers that could be harmful to democracy.

>They cater to our weaknesses, what psychologists call cognitive bias – when we unconsciously gravitate towards those who echo what we believe.

>""You're not seeing everything,"" Stephanie Sy, founder of Thinking Machines Data Science, said on the September 26 #HackSociety panel on Technology and the Public Debate. ""You're seeing what Facebook thinks you're most likely to interact with, and if you interact with something, you'll see more and more and more of that. And that naturally pushes people into social bubbles that don't talk to each other and engage with each other."" 

#5. Fake accounts abound, helping shape realities.  Something that Facebook has shown no interest to stop.

From [Fake accounts, manufactured reality on social media](https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/investigative/148347-fake-accounts-manufactured-reality-social-media)

>Create false perceptions. This is what a network of combined real and fake accounts on social media can achieve in a matter of minutes.

>Over the past several weeks, we monitored several suspicious accounts connected to various online Facebook groups.

>One account alone we determined to be fake was connected (as of October 6, 2016) to about 2.9 million members of various overseas Filipino groups associated with Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr, and other hobby groups. Another fake account was linked to over 990,000 members of groups supporting President Rodrigo Duterte, and still another was connected to an estimated 3.8 million members of various overseas Filipino organizations and buy-and-sell groups.

>Imagine the impact of a single message sent from just one fake account and spread to these hundreds of thousands of Facebook accounts. Even assuming only 10% actually share a post by a fake account, the spread of wrong information can still be damaging. They can convincingly manufacture reality on social media as they wish, transforming perception to reality, and swaying opinion on the basis of perceived number and power.

#6. It was not just fake accounts, it was also false information.  Until recently, Facebook showed no signs of wanting to do something about fake news either.

From [Fake News Floods the Philippines](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/opinion/fake-news-philippines.html)

>Just as the real-world killings include innocents, the online assassinations have proven similarly indiscriminate. A Filipina propagandist living in the Netherlands recently sought to discredit a journalist who, it turned out, only had the same name as someone who had worked for the opposition.

>Meanwhile, irresponsible conduct online continues, with only a few independent sites like the fact-checking blog Memebuster attempting scrutiny. Others have started campaigns against fake news or online harassment but have largely failed or come uncomfortably close to censorship. Despite our country’s issues, free speech still thrives, though the mob rule of populism certainly tries to control it through brute force and denial.

>In The Manila Times, Mr. Makabenta issued neither correction nor retraction of his article on Ms. Haley, despite public criticism as well as a statement from the American Embassy. Instead he doubled down in a subsequent column, citing President Trump’s rhetoric on a hands-off foreign policy.

#7. Nope, they did not move a finger, even though they have been told about it.  They needed the Cambridge Analytica scandal, something that they could not deny, to move into action.

>(Maria) Ressa recalls meeting three of Facebook's Asia-Pacific executives in Singapore in August 2016, and warning them of the platform's potential for exploitation by populist groups and leaders with authoritarian tendencies.

#8.  It's not just the US and the Philippines.

[Serious answers only pls] When Manny Paquiao finally finally wins the presidency...,"And he appoints his mother Dionisia Paquiao as the head of the magical and occult defense of the Philippines, what should be her personal title? Here are some of my suggestions.

1. **TAGURO** - nothing promotes intense fear than the dreaded Taguro, honestly the best villain in Ghost Fighter. TAPUSIN MO NA SIYA TAGURO!

2. Big D - do you think you have a big D? Wrong. Dionisia has the biggest D of all. Agree or suntok kay pacman.

3. Grand Kulamngot - With her kulam skills on display during her son's match, we already know she has the grandest of them all. Pacman only lost because she wasn't there to curse his opponents.

4. Vampire hunter D - I really like this manga. And it has a D on it.
