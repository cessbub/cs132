Abused,"Help your girlie out there, need ko lumipat urgently. It's been years na din and I'm very vocal sa physical abuse na ginagawa ng tatay ko ever since. And tonight was the worse, I don't know bat ako pinag-iinitan lately and I won't regret any impulsive  decision that I will made today. 

Just a minutes ago, binugbog ako ng tatay ko and was I was also hit below my head. Ramdam ko ang sakit sa katawan until now and I feel na magkakapasa to, I will take pics and magpapa medical agad ako tomorrow just in case na mag-file ako ng kaso. Do you know where can I get medical for this? Sa Parañaque po near sucat. 

Also I need to move out urgently, and he's making me stress throughout my childhood and until now and inaabuso physically and emotionally. Di ko maigalaw ng maayos ang likod ko ngayon. 

I need peace. And I will move out. 

Do you also know a place where can I rent for 2000? Alabang sana near festival. Di ko alam kung kakayanin ko pa tumagal dito. And I also let my friends know about this matter just in case something happened to me tonight. 

Di ako magaling mag kwento, pero sana maintindihan niyo. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1b3r2qu/abused/,t2_jbmennajw,2024-03-01 18:25:33,12
Mahirap ma abused ng babae sa Pilipinas,"My ex (now colleague) still harasses me kahit na ilang beses na akong nag plead na layuan na nya at tigilan na nya ko. Ilang beses akong nagmamakaawa pero hindi nya marespeto yun. Lagi nya kong hinarass sa chat/text at in person. We broke up for almost 6 months and she still thinks na kami pa rin until now. Guarding me with my every move. 

She's confronting or harassing me because:

1. Nagmamakaawa siya na maging kami ulit
2. She keeps saying na ako yung sinungaling at manipulative. 
3. Manunumbat siya sa lahat ng nagawa nya for me
4. Tinatakot nya ko na mag suicide siya pag di ko siya kinausap. 

I've been enduring that cycle repeatedly week for 6 months. Masakit lang sa part ko na she's making things up para mag mukhang victim and the fact na nagmakaawa na ko sa kanya na to stop confronting me everytime may relapse sya. Tbh, sobrang draining sa mental health and I can't seek for help Kasi I'm a guy and ang hirap i prove na I am verbally, physically and psychologically abused. Ang proof ko lang yung conversations namin. I don't know where to go or what to do. I can't quit.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1aspoy9/mahirap_ma_abused_ng_babae_sa_pilipinas/,t2_njba2z0oa,2024-02-17 09:28:39,71
I was physically abused my boyfriend (now my ex),"I’m 23 F and was physically abused by my ex last Feb 13. It was really bad, I was in pain all over my body and I had severe pain on head and scalp because of the punching and hair pulling I received. I couldn’t sleep the night after it happened because even with soft pillows masakit pa din. I had spent my Valentine’s Day in the hospital to get checked. I went to my usual doctor but she refused to see me after knowing my situation. She refused because she doesn’t want to get involved if ever magsampa ako ng kaso sa ex ko. I told her I’m not planning to and I just wanted to get checked kasi masakit talaga buong katawan ko but she still refused to get me checked and instead referred me to a general surgeon. There, I was interviewed again by another secretary and was asked why I was referred to their clinic. I gave her the referral and told her I wanted to get checked because I was physically abused. After hearing that, she proceeded to ask questions personal questions as to why I was physically abused. And not only her, even the surgeon asked me personal stuff. Idk if it’s part of their job to ask but it was really uncomfortable for me. I remember crying in the cr right after the consultation. I feel so embarrassed, so ashamed of the situation I’m in. I feel like people are judging me for being physically abused. The way people are treating me felt like it was my fault that I got myself physically abused. I was asked to get a ct scan of my brain because of head trauma injury. I was using my insurance so i went to the hmo cashier with the doctor’s referral. While processing, the cashier asked loudly why I had to get a brain plain bec apparently it was expensive and they wouldn’t easily approve it. There was a line behind me and i was embarrassed to say it out loud so iasked if i could write it instead. I wrote what my doctor wrote in his diagnosis, head trauma injury due to physical abuse.  The cashier seemed confused and asked me, “what do you mean by physical abuse?” She then told me to write a full incident report, time date and what has happened to me. So, I wrote there in detail what happened to me so that she’ll process na my form and I could get a ct scan na. Is this really part of the protocol? Do the patient really have to do this? Because it was really uncomfortable for my part. I was physically in pain and it doesn’t help that they’re also stressing me out mentally, making me recall everything that happened just so it would be approved by my insurance. It’s so fucking stressful for the patient. Don’t get me wrong, I’m grateful man na i get to go to the hospital to get treated but i didnt expect it to be this stressful. I even chose to go to this hospital, my university’s hospital, because I thought it would be more efficient than going to a public hospital. If only I knew na I would be rejected by my doctor, will be bombarded by personal questions, judged for being physically abused, and then forced to recall what happened to me, then I would’ve just stayed home na lang even though sakit na kaayo akong lawas. I’m supposed to go back to the doctor today, but idk man, i dont feel like getting up and going back. I’m still in pain tho, masakit pa din igalaw ang katawon ko but agwantahon lang guro nako ni than go back.

Psychologically abused men,"Timeline: is on my prev post

I had an ex and right now we're colleagues. The disturbing thing here is she verbally (most of the time) and physically (sometimes) harass me. It's not really good to my mental health since we're still a student and I do have some academic burden and personal/ social problems weighing on my head. As a guy it is really hard for me to defend or shout for help in this matter kasi she got a good public or social reputation and she's a girl. I can't leave my program because I don't want wanna ba delayed for a year because of my parents. 

 We broke up for almost 6 months now (we've been together for 1 to 2 months) and she still harass me everytime she heard me talking, being friends or eating out with an opposite sex. 

After our break up 6 months ago she asked me if maghahanap ba ko agad something like that. I confidently said to her na ""Hindi ako maghahanap kasi mag focus muna ako sa studies at sarili ko."" 

What I didn't said to her is I am fucked up. I'm so fucking drained to be in a relationship that time and up until now lalo na sa mga pinag gagawa nya. I know that I can't be flirting or being in a relationship right now because she fucked me up big time. 

After that break up I tried to focus on my work pero she's with me, we're colleagues so bantay sarado nya pa rin ako. Pag may nakakatabi or nakakausap lang akong babae hinaharass na nya ko sa chat saying mean and abusive words towards sakin. I still hold on what I said about not being in a relationship. I just wanna socialized or have a friend lang naman pero yun nga she's overstepping her boundaries and she doesn't respect me. 


She's the biggest scar of my life and she's the deepest bore of trauma to my brain. I really don't think that I can date again a girl because of her.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1arv81h/psychologically_abused_men/,t2_njba2z0oa,2024-02-16 08:37:39,3
The girl I like was abused. Gago kayong mga manyak kayo,"Ngayon ko lang aaminin. Oo na. I like her.

Pero shet di ako maka move on. The girl I like was sexually abused.

Mahaba to pero need ko lang talaga i-organize ang thoughts ko.

I (27M) have this (relatively) new officemate (26F) na sobrang ganda. Mga 5 months pa lang namin siyang kasama sa office. Maganda oo, pero nung una, di ko talaga type kasi parang too good to be true. Feeling ko ang pa-cute ng personality tapos masyadong mabait. Crush ng bayan bigla nung nagstart magwork dun sa office. Pati yung mga babae sa office, girl crush siya tapos tanungan nila ng skin care ganun. Ang ganda niya naman talaga tapos mabait, matalino, and knows how to carry herself. Pero everytime, di niya talaga inaaccept yung mga compliments na yun and would always say na, ""Akala niyo lang yan. Promise"" or ""Hala. Hindi talaga!"" Pet peeve ko pa naman yung mga ganyang ugali, yung feeling ko false humility lang. Yung pinuri ka na nga, tapos parang di mo pa inaaccept kahit obvious naman na totoo. But eventually, naging close din naman kami dahil lagi kaming sinasama ng boss namin sa mga trainings and conferences. I found out na sobrang funny niyang person, sobrang sarap kausap, may sense kausap, and parehas ang mga trip namin sa life. Pero shet, bukod sa looks niya, what I really admired at first ay yung galing niya sa work. Nabago yung tingin ko sa kanya nung nakita ko na kung paano siya mag-work. When she speaks, sobrang ibibigay mo yung attention mo sa kanya. Medyo naging crush ko siya by this time. Yung tipong dati naeexcite lang akong pumasok para sa aircon pero ngayon naeexcite na ako kasi makikita ko siya tapos makausap. Shet high school.

Tapos last week, nagkayayaan kami sa office na mag-inuman kasi weekend naman. Tapos napagkwentuhan namin yung topic about love life. Ako, nakwento ko lang yung ex ko and sinabi ko lang na di pa talaga ako sure kung kaya ko nang pumasok ulit sa relationship. Kahit naman crush ko siya, wala naman akong balak na manligaw or ano. Natutuwa lang ako sa kanya. Nung turn niya na. Sabi niya, wala daw siyang love life at NBSB siya. Akala namin joke pero seryoso pala. Alam naman naming single siya pero nagulat lang kaming lahat na NBSB siya so inask siya nung mga babae naming officemate kung bakit.

Medyo hesitant siya pero she told us na struggling siya to handle romantic relationships with guys kasi she was sexually harrassed multiple times since she was a child by different guys (cousin, tito, lolo, classmate). And nobody, even her parents, knew about it hanggang ngayon. She told us na for the longest time, it really affected her self-confidence, gave her major trust issues, and anxiety. Na parang ang dumi-dumi niya. She also told us na everytime may magtry na magparamdam or manligaw sa kanya, she would automatically have fears thinking na sex lang ang habol sa kanya or kaya kung good naman ang intentions, iiwan din siya kasi she has gone through the abuse and would push those people away. And nafufrustrate siya kasi lagi siyang sinasabihang maganda pero never niya daw nakita yung sarili niya na maganda (kaya pala kapag may nagsasabi sa kanya na ang ganda ganda niya, di niya maaccept) or worthy of anyone's love. Tapos since magkaharap kami ng upuan, kita ko na pinipigilan niyang umiyak. And shet gusto ko talagang tumayo nung time na yun at yakapin siya. Gusto kong manuntok. Gusto kong magkwento pa siya at iiyak niya lang sakin lahat hanggang di na siya nahihirapan. Gusto kong makita niya na sobrang ganda niya. SHET. After nun, di ako makatingin sa kanya, nahihiya ako sa kanya dahil may mga tanginang manyak na kalahi ko.

Pagbalik sa office this week, normal naman lahat. She's back to her normal self na cute and funny (shet nahulog na talaga). Pero I will never look at her the same way. Grabe ang admiration ko sa babaeng to. Kung paano niya naforgive, paano siya nag go on sa life, and become this great of a person. Alam ko namang strong independent woman siya, pero shet. Ewan. Gusto ko pa din siyang yakapin na lang kasi alam kong nasasaktan pa din siya.

Di ko alam anong gagawin ko sa nararamdaman ko ngayon sa totoo lang. Gusto ko siyang tawagan kaso ano namang sasabihin ko. Paano kung lumayo din siya sa akin. Shet. Overthinker kasi ako. Anyway, please please check on your friends and family, mapababae o lalaki, baka they are also experiencing abuse of any kind. Especially the children, make them aware about this issue. I can't imagine her carrying this fucking burden ever since and bearing it alone. SHET.

Edit: Najudge na pagkatao ko dito. Pero sige you are entitled to say what you think naman. So all goods. And reading back, shet ang cringey nga nung yakap part. And parang white knight nga. Sorry na for my unfiltered thoughts. Tapos di pa pwedeng dinedescribe ko lang siya? Manyak na agad.

My point is, the people who experienced this kind of trauma cannot see themselves as others see them. Parang nadeprive sila to experience love and to receive love. Hindi naman nila kasalanan pero they are the ones who have to pay for the damages done. All because may manyak na nagtake advantage sa kanila.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/12cjlh7/the_girl_i_like_was_abused_gago_kayong_mga_manyak/,t2_tymgbv4s,2023-04-05 21:00:29,125
Emotionally Abused,"ngayon ko lang nalaman na form ng emotional abused inabot ko sa mga taong tinuring kong pamilya. i always say na magkaroon nang maayos na communication but palagi silang passive-agressive every time they have a problem with me. cold and silent treatment din natatanggap ko kapag may problema sila na wala naman akong kinalaman. naging punching bag ako and source nila ng aruga. they drained the fuck out of me. at nang sumabog ako, they made me feel like ako ang mali. i'm just glad internship na at di ko na sila makakasama. nakakasuka. nakakasawa magtiwala.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/19912q9/emotionally_abused/,t2_f4ixiymq,2024-01-18 00:45:10,2
I was sexually abused once when I was a kid,"I’m 31F and no one knows this story. Today is my abuser’s birthday (my lolo) so nakikita ko naman face nya sa feed ko. This happened once, I am the type of person na naalala lahat. This happened when I was around 6 to 7 yrs old I don’t wanna elaborate pa pero sinabihan nya ko na wag ko daw sabihin and binigyan nya ko P10.00. Kaya noong namatay sya I didn’t feel any remorse. Sa sobrang love ko sa Mommy ko na I don’t wanna give her “isipin” or sama ng loob di ko na sinabi sa iba. This is also one of the reasons but di ako close sa side nila.

Am I abused because I'm the nonchalant type? ,"People always see me as a nonchalant/stoic type of guy. Kaya madali lang for them to throw or blame everything to me even though they're the ones starting or causing those problems. 

Naalala ko lang about sa ex kong abuser. She knows that I'm the type that can process a trauma or problems well. Ang hindi nya alam deep inside sobrang sakit na sakit ako and sobrang strict at pataas ng pataas na yung walls ko in everything. She repeatedly provoke, and accused me of living the life (nanlalandi o lumalandi) and the manipulative one. Pero di nya alam I'm just healing alone by myself kasi I don't want anyone to be involved sa traumas ko  especially new people. 

Ang bigat lang na people will always try to put you down dahil lang mukha kang strong, calm and composed outside pero di nila alam you're wounded and crying inside and you're fighting to stay alive dahil you're still hoping you'll meet or be in a good people that will give you love and support in near future. Pero yun nga at the point of losing that hope. 

Humans are cruel.  

TLDR: Hindi lang siguro aware or marunong makaramdam yung mga abusers lalo na kung nonchalant or stoic yung tao and they will resort into gaslighting the abused ones lalo na pag lumalaban na sila. 

Being a nonchalant is a disadvantage rin kasi people will judge and assumed na ikaw yung abusive, insensitive, selfish or manipulative.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1awrbdu/am_i_abused_because_im_the_nonchalant_type/,t2_njba2z0oa,2024-02-22 07:42:56,19
My Sexual Abuser is coming home,"I'm a male and my abuser is a woman. She's my father's cousin. Nangyari ito nung bata pa ako and siya lagi ang bantay ko that time. Lately in my life, I have flashbacks of what happened at the time and bumabalik kaunti sa memory ko kong pano nya ako hinalay. 

As a dude, I consider myself lucky... kasi, diba, imagine maganda siya eh. Artistahin na mukha cousin ni erpats. Pero at the same time, parang na realize ko rin na what happened is very wrong. She's a pedo. Teenager siya that time, and I'm just at the age of 5-7 years old.

So, bali ang nangyari ay nandito siya ulit, bumalik ng Pinas for vacation. And sa dami dami ng pwede nya ichat, ako ang chinat nya if makakapunta ba daw ako sa dinner this 25 (it's a family gathering dinner).

Now, remembering all the things that happened, I feel nauseous and dirty at the same time. Pero siempre I replied naman sa kanya na oo andun ako sa araw na yun. Di ko alam if alam nya or dapat ko ba i-brought up sakanya yung nakaraan. I also have this fantasies na gusto ko sana may mangyari saming dalawa, and this time around, I want to be the one yung magkaroon ng control if sakali man.

Living with my abuser.,"#Trigger warning 
#I need help. 

#I married a monster.

Long post ahead. Please bare with me.  

I consider myself as a single mom of many kids. 

Isipin niyo na lahat ng word na pwede niyo ikabit sa word na abused. Ako yun. 

Sinasaktan niya ako if I refuse to have sex with him. Ang sabi niya “responsibilidad” ko daw yun bilang asawa. NO THAT’S MARITAL RAPE kako. Meron pang isang bagay na gustong gusto niya ginagawa pero di ko na masasabi kasi it will be a give away. (Sexual and physical abuse). 
He cheated on me and I had STD not once, not twice… I told him that it’s actually ground for annulment. Feeling ko ang dumi dumi ko. 

Ilan taon na ako lang ang bumuhay sa pamilya namin. (Economic abuse) 

Gina-gaslight niya ako and he used emotional manipulation. He one time said he’d kill himself dahil ayaw kong makipag sex sa kanya.  (Emotional abuse). 

To name a few. 

Ilang beses na akong nag attempt na makipag hiwalay sa kanya, but he knows I have a forgiving heart. Pero lahat my limit. Nauubos din tayo. 

We moved to a different city to start a new life. Ang alam ng mga friends ko hiwalay na kami. Which is partly true. Di ko lang sinabi na nagkabalikan kami kasi I used it as an excuse (not my proudest moment) I don’t like telling lies. Siguro napapansin nila na di ko sinasagot yung mga tanong nila. Para di na ako mag lie pa. 

It was so bad na umabot ako sa point that I almost kill myself. 2 tao lang nakakaalam nito. 

Few years ago he throw a fit kasi ayaw kong makipag sex sa kanya. I was so tired galing sa work tapos ako pa naglinis ng house. He was jobless. Pag di nagwo-work yung pagwawala niya he resorts to verbal abuse towards my kids. Hindi ko kinaya. I begged him to kill me para matapos na lahat ng paghihirap ko. Few months after that nagtino. So kala ko ok na. Nope. Nagkawork lang siya pero ganun pa din. Masaya kaming lahat sa bahay pag wala siya. Tahimik ang mundo. 

Couple of years ago I decided na ayaw ko na talaga. I told him to move out. But he didn’t. But for me hiwalay na kami. Pinaalis ko siya sa room. No physical contact di ko kinakausap nakablock sa lahat. I decided to take care of myself again. Nag message siya bigla using a different number, asking for sex. Like WTF! Seryoso? He began stalking my accounts. Called me a slut at may lalake daw ako. 

Last year he beat the shit out of me. Nag pa blotter ako, VAWC, pati sa Barangay. Walang nangyari. Sabi aalis na siya ng bahay pero nandito pa din. He threatens to kill me harm my family and friends at work. 

Madami siya kilala na influential na tao.

Pero anong ginawa nya? Nagalit siya sa amin! Tinulak yung kawawang customer sa kabilang table na concerned lang naman. Sinigawan kami na wag daw kami makialam??? Tapos ngayon sa gc namin inaaway nya yung mga single sa tropa namin, inggit daw sila and di daw nila magegets kasi wala silang jowa??? Ha? Requirement ba ang DV sa pagjojowa???

"I felt thrown under the bus, abused, and am exhausted","Nagkwento ako sa ate ko pero iba ang wording na ginamit niya sa kuya namin na nananakit. 

Ending, ako ang sinampal at sinapak not once but twice. 

Tapos wala man lang akong narinig na sorry sa kanya? Napakatibay. Nagkwento lang ako, ibang word ginamit ay yung delivery nya ng message at sinita kuya namin, ang ending nagsumbong daw ako kahit nagkwento lang ako. 

At sasabihin nyo,  na hayaan ko na at wag sirain araw ko at naging honest ako na hindii lang araw nasira sakin. Pati utak ko nasisira. Seen. 

Ang sakit sobra. Walang nag take accountability. Walang nag sorry. Nobody was there to comfort me. I felt thrown under the bus. Ako yung nasaktan physically. Pero wala, it was only I who suffered physically, verbally, and emotionally. Ako ang kailangan lumayas sa bahay na pinundar ng mga magulang namin kahit isa ako sa mga taong nag w-work hard to sustain yung business na iniwan nila, at yung eldest na walang ginawa kundi maging batugan, shopee halos araw araw with an average spending of 500-1K ang hindi papalayasin? Anong logic yon? 

At magtataka sila bakit ganito ako? Wag damdamin kasi ako talo? 

Gusto ko magalit. Hindi nila alam anong sakit nung ginawa nila. I felt abandoned. Pero pag sila sinasaktan ni kuya, sino andyan para sa kanila para ipagtanggol sila? I comfort sila?

Well, dapat di na lang ako nagexpect. Just because I was doing it for them, I shouldn't expect them to do it for me. 

Pero kahit ako yung walang bisyo, at di pabigat, nasasaktan physically, emotiobally, and verbally, ako pa din kailangan umunawa at umalis? Grabe.

my brother-in-law is abused by my sister,"I(F) was caught in the middle of this war. Mag bf-gf palang Sila, lagi na akong dawit sa away nilang nakakagulantang. Dati, my ate would borrow my phone pa na keypad to call and text Kuya from afar (he used to be a soldier). Tapos bigla nalang tumigil sa service si Kuya and that shocked my family. Kase we know him as a passionate man in service. He's reliable, mabait, and dedicated to whatever he loves.
Kaya pinag tataka ko rin bakit lagi sya inaaway ng ate ko.
Nung college ako, tumigil sa service si Kuya and he suddenly started living with us. Maliit lang bahay namin so they sleep sa living room. We were really cramped. Walang problema sakin nandun si Kuya pero badtrip kami nun kay Ate kase we kind had a hunch na she insisted that (pati ang pag baba ni kuya  sa military service).

May mga nag susumbong kay Mama na nakikita sila naghahabulan sa may likod bahay namin na community din. Yung family namin parang tahimik lang talaga for over 30 yrs na paninirahan namin until may nag sumbong na ganun kay Mama. Sobrang nag worry sya and at the same time nagalit.

Kahit ganun kalala sila mag-away, nagpakasal sila bigla. Akala namin magbabago dynamin ng relationship nila e. Like we're expecting na magiging healthy rs.

Ako lagi una nilang tinatawagan pag nag-aaway sila. Na-witness ko na mga kagaguhan ng ate ko. Pero wala akong magawa kase hawak ako sa leeg ng ate ko dahil pinapaaral nya ako that time.
May away sila na tinawag nila ako for ""saklolo"" daw. Pumunta agad ako sa apartment nila (btw humiwalay sila nung kasal na sila).
Sobrang gulo ng bahay nila. Madaming nakakalat ng gamit sa sahig. Pag pasok ko ng kwarto nila umiiyak yung Ate ko and I was thinking she was the victim. Tapos biglang tumayo si ate nag bihis Sabi nya alis na daw sya at magjiwalay na sila. Tas sumasagot si Kuya and it triggered my sister tapos nag start syang humablot ng random stuff around her at pinag babato nya si Kuya. Sinabunutan and sinuntok and all. 
Natulala ako and I was in total shock. Di ako nakagalaw. So nasa gitna ako ng batuhan nila. I yelled at them. Sabi ko tama na and such. Kahit papano they stopped. Umalis ako ssaglit and tinawag parents ko. Kinauaap ni Mama si Ate and si Papa kay Kuya. Naging okay sila.

But this severe fight kept happening.

One night, I was reviewing for a recitation. Frustrated ako sa dami ng reviewhin. Nasa iisang fb account lang sila and name ng lalake yung nakalagay.
That account kept calling me. Tapos sinagot ko yung call, they're half naked and they were both hurting theirselves. Nagsisigawan sila, nag susumbong sakin. (Mind you, this isn't the first time they did it).
I heard words na ""pornstar"", ""sex vid"" and dun yun umikot. And di ko na-absorb ginagawa nila so I dropped the call. Ayoko na sana sabihin kila Mama kase kahit sila pagod na sakanila. Pero di ko alam gagawin ko and they kept calling me. 
(quick bg: I got traumatized sa nude pix and such dahil sa ex kong jerk at kumalat mga yun)
So I felt rush sa katawan ko and bigla nalang ako nag breakdown. Umiiyak lang ako e kase hindi ko kinaya yung ginagawa ng mag-asawang yun sakin. I couldn't breathe, and my thoughts were reeling about them. I almost puked. Dahil dun nalaman nila Mama and they got really mad.

After that chinat ako ng ate ko and told me (non verbatim) ""diba sabi ko wag nyo na ipaalam kila mama at papa? Tinatawagan ko kayo kase kailangang ko tulong. Pinapalala nyo lang yung gulo.""

Nag mura talaga ako sa utak ko. Likeee, sa puntong yon, sarili nya pa rin iniisip nya.

Fast forward to today, she cheated on Kuya. Every now and then, lagi sila nag-aaway. Ang kapal pa ng muka ng ate ko, nag stay na si Kuya sakanya, ganun pa rin treatment nya kay Kuya. Ako unang naka alam na she cheated dahil may nag chat saking asawa ng iba while at was at work! Nanlumo talaga ako, umiyak ako sa CR. Kase she even sent me evidences na tugma sa days na biglang nawawala ate ko. 
And that wife was spewing names na kilala ko lahat. May mga classmate ng kapatid ko na dun ipinapdala yung mga pera na hinuhuthot nya sa lalake. May mga laptop, branded shoes and expensive stuff na parang nakakaduda kung san nanggaling.

Di ko nga akalain na may iwo-worse pa pala sya e. Nakailang pukpok na ng sermon from my parents pero wala talagang nangyayari sakaniya. Lumalala lang. Pero I fucking hate my sister. Namuo na tong galit ko sakanya. Ako pa laging witness Sa mga kagaguhan nya. Sa lahat ng na-witness kong away nila, sya nag umpisa e. And this cheating stuff? Nakakadiri sya. Sya pa ang may worse behavior towards her husband. Alam mo yun? Para syang naghahanap palagi ng drama at gulo? Tas papalalain nya at aawyin si Kuya. Tas sa dulo sya ang lalabas na victim. Last away nila last month, binilog nya ulo ni Kuya and chatted us na ""pag need kayo ni Ate nyo wala kayo"". Di ko ma-blame si Kuya kase manipulative talaga Ate kong tanga.

Working na ako now and ang pinapaaral na ng ate ko now ay yung kapatid (F) kong younger. Ngayon pinapapunta nya yung younger sister ko sa apartment nila out of nowhere. And sinabihan ko yung younger sister ko na magbibigay ako allowance skanya wag lang sya pumunta dun kase ayokong mangyari sakanya mga pinaranas nilang trauma sakin.

The worse thing about this, yung parents at siblings ko na elder think na all my sister's need is Jesus, church, cast out ng demon from her, mga religious shit. At the back of my mind, anong magagawa nun? E active nga sa church Ate kong yun e. Kase that sister needs a therapy!!!

I was sexually abused as a child,"When i was a child my older sister sexually abused me. Being so young and naive at the time, how was i supposed to know what was right and what was wrong, i didn’t even really know what sex was. She talked me into performing sexual acts with her on several occasions.

At the time of the abuse, i believe i was about 7-8 years old, i am now 15. My brain has blocked out a lot of the trauma however i do remember short flashbacks from each time. At about age 13-14 i finally started to realise what went on in my childhood, i had suppressed all these memories and emotions for so long it was like it never even happened.

The first time it happened i was about 7 years old. My older sister, who would have been about 14 ish, took me into my own bedroom and began to show me what i now recognise to be a porn video. Before the video had got to any sort of sexual scenes she turned it off and decided to just ‘show me’ what she wanted me to do. I couldn’t tell you what then happened as my mind has blanked out certain parts of the events but i can only assume it was something sexual. I don’t remember any more from that time.

On a separate occasion, i remember being in my mothers bedroom with my sister and my cousin who is a female and the same age as my sister (13-14). I have no clue how we ended up there but my sister then told me to take my trousers and pants off. Being a young child i did as i was told. My sister and my cousin then laughed and giggled at my private parts and mocked me for about 5 minutes or so. I remember the extreme feeling of embarrassment and just feeling completely uncomfortable. That’s all i remember.

Another time we were in my bedroom, she was performing oral sex on me, whether it was an accident or not i have no idea, but she bit my penis. I remember looking down and instantly there was a lot of blood. I cried and cried. I wanted to tell my mum so bad but in the back of my mind i knew what me and my sister were doing was wrong. In the end i told my mum that i ran into the corner of a table in my room and that was why i was bleeding. To this day i have no idea how she believed that, and the strange thing about it is she never took me to a&e or anything like that. I just feel like if that happened to a child you would. I can’t get my head around it.

There were quite a few more occasions where my sister made me kiss her, have sexual intercourse with her, perform oral on her etc.

Currently, I am in my last year of secondary school and i have sessions every 2 weeks with a private counsellor who specialises in trauma. My girlfriend and her parents, one of my friends and my counsellor are the only people who i have ever spoken about this to. I don’t think telling my mum is something that i could even think about doing anytime soon. My sister is now 21 and still lives at home with me and my mum. We never ever said a word about it since and our relationship is completely normal. It’s like it never happened. But it did.

Due to the trauma, i have been suffering with depression for the past year or two, i have gone through stages of heavy self harm but i am currently 2-3 months clean.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/16rwfc9/i_was_sexually_abused_as_a_child/,t2_rpnx104b,2023-09-26 00:15:53,4
I wish I was Abused by my parents and relatives,"19M. I am a first-year college student, and I live at my relative and parent's house. Yes I wish I was abused by my parents and relatives. The reason is that I have a definitive reason to leave. Yes I know being abused by any means is bad and no one should do so, but I stand with what I said. I have always been stuck at this point of whether I should go or not because they have provided for me. I hate it here, feeling like a prison, wherein everywhere I go, everything I do should be said, but also everything and anything I do is wrong. I am the youngest so I would understand why they would say that it is them being protective, but at some point, there should be a line right??? I have never felt free even once. The only time I feel like myself or anything positive is when I am outside or at my girlfriend's place. Always telling me I am young and don't know anything. I AM TIRED OF IT. My mom especially says a lot of things like, for me to be adopted instead, and a lot of other things I don't want to say. One last thing I hate is that all the guilt-tripping and always ending up being my fault, never anyone else's.

Nakakatakot ma-accuse ng sexual abuse wrongly,"I was accused of forcing someone to sleep with me and para magsend ng bare naked pictures.  At first, I was like “eh, I know na I didn’t and that’s enough”, pero little did I know, it wasn’t as near as what I thought it would be. 

Let’s be real, it’s undeniably and unfortunately, since it came from a woman’s mouth, everyone believed her na she was SA’d by me. At an instant, I lost my friends, my well-respected image, and most importantly, my identity. 

It’s tough to live with what I’m feeling. The constant fear of bumping into someone who thinks na I’m a bad person. The fear of loving or trusting someone again as I might be betrayed again. 

It has been months that I can’t sleep properly and the inability to appreciate myself. In fact, I feel like dying whenever my hormones act up. The guilt and conscience of being horny even though I didn’t do anything bad at all kills me slowly. 

Minsan, napapaisip ako na no one deserves this. The consequences I had to go through over a lie is unimaginable.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/19em0m0/nakakatakot_maaccuse_ng_sexual_abuse_wrongly/,t2_dz0euv4z,2024-01-25 01:07:52,328

My live in partner is verbally abusive,"Earlier today, he mentioned hanging out with his law school blockmates. When I called to see what they were up to, he said he was heading to the cemetery to visit his grandma's grave. Later, when I checked in, he sounded pretty down, which I figured might be because he missed his grandma. He couldn't say when he'd be back, and when I asked about their plans, he was vague. Plus, a few weeks ago I saw a photo of a female classmate on his phone, who might've lived near the cemetery. When I asked if he'd pick her up, he snapped and yelled at me saying ""ANG BASTOS MO! PUNYETA KA"" before hanging up.
Is this a sign to call it quits?",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1ax4o6t/my_live_in_partner_is_verbally_abusive/,t2_r8io8kqb,2024-02-22 19:55:50,13
Female abuser,"There this psychopathic ex of mine na sinasaktan ako physically and verbally dahil lang sa mga tamang hinala or pagiging selosa nya. Mind you, ex status na kami at siya rin tong currently that time ay active sa bumble at ako hindi. 

Nagseselos siya dahil lang may nakakausap or I was just being a nice colleague sa mga kasama namin. Nasa med field kami so majority babae. May time na nakatabi ko lang yung isang babae kong colleague sa lounge while I'm watching a series tapos bigla siyang mag cchat na ang intimate ko daw with her. I dont even fucking know my colleague's name that time. 

Tapos pag i coconfront nya ko she always verbally accused me of something na hindi ko naman ginawa and pag nag init ulo nya due to her overthinking sasaktan nya ko. 

May time na pinagsasampal nya ko then nung natalsik salamin ko (I wear a glass) bigla na kong napikon so I pushed her away to stop hurting me its just that nag land yung both knees nya non kaya nagka pasa and she took a photo of that as evidence at pinapakita nya sa lahat para ako yung mukhang abuser and mas madali maka convince na abuser ang lalake kesa babae. 

May time rin na she's confronting me while I'm driving and she punched me sa likod ng ulo ko 4 to 5 times. During those time sobrang nag iinit na ko pero I controlled myself dahil I'm driving. Pero nung time na yon my hands felt numb and ang blurry ng vision ko. 

Her abuse's been going on for almost 6 months now. May mga kaibigan na ring nadamay sa problema namin at syempre kakampihan nila or mag side pa rin sila sa babae while they label or spread lies about me making me as the toxic abuser guy. 

All I want for the both of us is peace. How many times I tried to make amenments pero siya tong insisting na gusto nya exclusive kami, gusto nya sa kanya lang ako pag kami ang nag uusap. 

I always received  hate messages from her. Blaming me ;  Saying na ako yung sinungaling at ako yung manipulative. It hurts a lot dahil siya yung nagmamanipulate sakin dati pa by threatening me na mag suicide siya pag di ko siya kinakausap o pag di ako pumayag na maging kami ulit. She always fooling me around rin na nag iimbento siya ng mga bagay just to control me.


It's hard to be abused in this world lalo na pag babae abuser mo. Pag lalake ka, need mo pang i justify, i prove, mag collect ng decent evidence just to be heard of. Pero di pa rin guaranteed yung help, sympathy at justice dahil ""lalake"" ka at nasa Pilipinas ka. And in the end of the day you're just a low life sad boy asking for pity.

Verbally abusive partner.,"I have to get this out of my chest kasi sobra na. Recently me and my partner are having a rough patch in our relationship. For the first few months sobra ko siyang intindihin sa mga ginawa niyang mali, naging gentle, kalmado, and soft-spoken ako pag ina-address ko mga problems ko (ganun naman dapat) and never ko siya minura or ininsulto kahit malala ginawa niya, so sa una maayos naman napag-uusapan mga problems namin pero nung tumagal na, madalas ko siya naaaway dahil sa pag-overthink ko dahil sa mga ginawa niyang mali and then siya tong magagalit na and may masasabi na masama (pero di pa malala) and makikipag-break na even if maayos ko sinasabi, it goes like this ""Hello, nafi-feel ko nawawalan ako tiwala sayo dahil sa \*\*\*\*\*\* and nahihirapan ako paniwalaan ka. Gusto ko lang communicate to para maayos and pag-usapan natin sana"" pero makikipag-break parin siya, so nahirapan ako.

And then inayos ko sarili ko but ako naman tong nagkamali but I gave my partner assurance and all all the time but then dun na nagsimula yung pagmumura niya sa'kin, insults, shouting, mean comments, lagi sinasabi ""ayoko na"",and pagiging rude and masungit. Grabe anger and lashout niya sakin. And kahit small tampo magiging malalang away and then makikipag-break siya tapos mumurahin ako and all, hinahayaan ko parin na ganun siya pero sinasabi ko na di tama yun and wag ganun sinasabi niya paggalit pero wala parin.

overtime, lumaki resentments and hate ko sakanya kasi yung treatment niya sakin sobrang disrespectful. Ngayon, yung argument style niya na aggressive nakuha ko na. Di ko na siya naiitnindihan, naisisgawan ko na rin siya pero never ko parin siya minumura or insult. alam ko di ako ganun pero iniisip ko dahil sa treatment niya sakin dati kaya nakuha ko rin and na-adapt ko yung traits niya and kaya napo-project ko sakanyan anger ko sakanya. Ayoko maging ganto lalo na ngayon may sakit siya and di ko siya maintindihan and inuuna ko galit ko. Sometimes I think naging ganto ba 'ko dahil sakanya.

abusive step mom,"okay so very fresh lang siya and dito lang naisip ko mag open since ayaw ko muna mag kwento sa friends ko. first time lang din tong nangyari kaya super ina-anxiety ako lalo na at hindi ako lumaki sa bahay na nag sasakitan or nag aaway mga tao. 

okay so brief kwento lang ng background. yung step mom ko for 5 yrs, lalo na last yr, halos siya na nag provide samin financially since super kulang yung sweldo ng dad ko kasi kasi nasira yung truck na gamit niya for work. so parang kahit anong sabihin niya sinusunod na lang din ni papa kasi we owe her big time. ngayon lasing siya, sinundo siya ni papa. umuwi siya nag dadabog, lahat ng gamit sa lamesa hinagis, pinag lock-an pa ng pinto si papa and kung hindi pa niya ako tinawag hindi siya makakapasok. nung binabagsak pa lang niya yung pintuan nanginginig na ako bilang isang tao na hindi nga sanay sa ganon na environment. hindi naman nila ako dinadamay sa away nila pero ayoko lang talaga nakakarinig ng ganon. nahiga siya sala, umupo si papa kung san siya humiga then inayos ni papa yung tumbler na nasira kasi nga hinagis niya. bigla niyang sinipa si papa kaya nalaglag siya sa pagkakaupo then tumusok sa kamay niya yung pusher na gamit niya pang ayos kaya sobrang nagdudugo kamay niya. don na ako nagsalita since nakita ko na sinasaktan na talaga si papa, kaso si papa pinapasok na ako sa kwarto. nung una ayaw ko pa kasi nga grabe yung dugo sa kamay niya pero pumasok na lang din ako kasi naisip ko baka ayaw niya na madamay ako. after that kinausap niya na yung step mom ko, kaso mas lalo akong nagalit nung sinabi niya wala siyang pakealam kung nasugatan at sobrang nagdudugo yung kamay ni papa. narinig ko pa sinabi ni papa na wag sanang umabot sa nananakit na kasi sinampal daw siya at sinipa nga. 

ngayon, wala na akong pakealam kung halos siya nag provide samin financially last yr. wala akong pakealam kung siya nagdadala ng pagkain sa hapag namin. sobra sobrang galit na lang nararamdaman ko sa kaniya at hinihiling ko na lang na sana maghiwalay na sila.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1ao2jxs/abusive_step_mom/,t2_hwxyhhf2,2024-02-11 15:36:17,1

karamihan naman po sa atin ginagamit yung phrases na “trauma bonding” at “narcissistic abuse” at kadalasan ko nga to naririnig ay sa tiktok. but here’s the thing: you will never know you’re abused until you get out of the situation.

you arent aware pala basta under control ka ng isang narcissist. grabe. di ko pa maprocess sa brain ko until now ang lahat ng manipulation, gaslighting, pagsisinungaling at paggawa sa akin na isang DAKILANG tanga.

abusive mother,"Asar na asar padin ako sa isang nanay nakasabay kong sumakay ng jeep kaninang umaga.

So for the context, sumakay akong jeep kaninang umaga and doon ako pumwesto sa likod ng driver and then maya maya madaming nag babaan so onti nalang kaming natira sa jeep.

Well di ko naman ugaling tumingin sa mga kapwa ko commuters, lagi lang akong nag c cp sa byahe pero inagaw ng attention ko yung isang mother siguro around 19-22 yrs old palang siya and dala niya yung dalawang anak nya. Yung isa is hawak nya, siguro months palang yon and yung isa naman is nasa 2-3 yrs old nakaupo sa tabi nya habag tulog.

Since onti na nga lang kami malaki din yung space, and syempre jeep yon minsan mag b-brake na super lakas dahilan para matumba yung tutulog na bata and take note since onti nalang kami walang katabi yung bata and di din naman siya hawak ng mama nya dahil may hawak nga din na baby, so sa sobrang galit nya is kinurot nya yung bata and sinabi ""ptngina mo! gumising kana kase! sasama sama ka tapos matutulog ka!!?"". 

Super nagulat ako kase pota ganon nya i treat yung anak nyang bata?? na trigger ako jusko pero di pa tapos yon since yung anak nya nga is antok na antok edi nakatulog ulit and pinagmumura nya na naman and kinurot at kotong. Sobrang awang awa ako sa bata dahil wala pa namang alam yon sa mundo at natutulog lang naman siya pero kung i treat niya pota nakakakilabot at isa pa ganon na siya sa public places, pano pa pag sila-sila lang. 

Gustong gusto kong awatin si ate sa ginagawa niya sa bata pero natatakot din ako since ang laki niya and ako patpatin lang plus malapit nakong bumaba.

Namatay na yung tita ko who physically & emotionally abused me & my sister nung highschool kami pero wala akong naramdaman nung nawala sya.,"Napatawad ko na sya. Nakahingi pa nga sya ng tawad 2 months bago sya namatay. Sabi ko, wala na yun tita. Kalimutan mo na yun.  Totoong napatawad ko na sya pero traumatized pa rin ako pag may mga bagay na nakakapang trigger sa akin ng mga bad memories na iyon.

Unexpected ang death nya. Nasa Canada na ko ngayon. Nung nabalitaan ko yon, iyak ng iyak mama ko. Pero ako, wala. Blanko lang. Of course hindi ako masaya sa nangyari pero hindi rin naman ako nalungkot at naapektuhan.

I feel bad for feeling this way.

7 years din kaming nasa puder nya. May mga good memories naman pero bilang lang. Pag lang naka mood sya pag may pera sya that time. Pag wala, ayun, Princess Sarah at Ms. Minchin na ang atake.

Hindi ko masabi to sa mama ko kasi alam kong masasaktan sya. Kapatid nya yun at mahal nya. Kahit may nagawang ganun ang tita ko, sobrang buti ng mama ko at pinatawad nya.

"Young, Gullible, and Sexually Abused","Hi! I am turning 21 this year. I have this secret that I have been keeping to myself for more than 10 years already. 

When I was around 7-9 years old, I had a sexual experience with my cousin. That time, he was still a minor, a teenager, he was around 14-16, I think.

It started when he called me one day while I was passing by their house. He was alone as his Mom and sister wasn't at their house. Since he called me, I went to him. I don't exactly remembered what happened basta he explained to me na we're going to play. He was the father, I was the mother. We kissed, he put his pen*s on my mouth and even f*ck me in between my legs. There was no penetration.

I don't really know why did I allowed him to do that to  me. I guess I was young, obedient, and gullible so I did everything he told me to do. He also told me not to tell it to anyone because it's our secret. Also, if I tell anyone that we played, that he was the father and I was the mother, they will think that I was gay. Everytime I pass by their house, and when no one is around there, he would always call me and we would do those sexual acts. He did all of that to me in the different parts of their house. I remembered him cumming on my face, my belly, my ass, even forced me to swallow his semen. He would always take me then to their bathroom and clean me after.

Kahit na naglalaro ako with our other cousins tatawgin niya ako and he would kiss me and tell me to jack him off. Nasanay ako sa ginagawa namin kaya hindi ko na naisip na mali pala yung ginagawa namin, na inaabuso na pala ako. Yung mga ginagawa namin, it lasted for more than a year. I was really glad when I realized na yung ginagawa namin is hindi normal kasi hindi ko naman yun ginagawa with my other cousins and hindi rin yun ginagawa ng iba kong cousins with him or with our other cousins.

When I realized na I was being sexually used and abused, ako na ang umiwas. I stopped going to their house, I pretended that I didn't heard him everytime he would call me, and as much as I could, I avoid him. After several weeks if ignoring him, nag stop din naman siya. Hindi na ukit nangyari yun.

Remembering the days that I was sexually used and abused by my cousin, I always felt that I was also the one to blame for letting him abuse me. If I wasn't so gullible, sana hindi nangyari yun. Hindi ko na nasabi pa kahit kanino yung nangyari kasi takot ako and until now natatakot pa rin ako dahil una sa lahat, mali yung ginawa ko. As a child, naakot ako na baka pagalitan ako kaya I kept it to myself, thinking na mas mainam na hindi malaman ng iba para hindi ako mapagalitan. As an adult today, I am keeping it to myself because I am afraid na baka walang maniwala. I am afraid to tell it to anyone kasi nakakahiya.

As a child, I thought makakalimutan ko rin pero forgetting it wasn't as easy as tearing a sheet of paper pala. Dala dala ko siya until now. And everytime na nakikita ko ang cousin ko na to, naaalala ko yung mga ginawa niya sa akin. Kapag ako lang mag isa, naaalala ko rin ang mga ito. And it always break my heart. Halo halo na yung nararamdaman ko. Regret, hatred for him and myself, pity, sadness, hindi ko na ma specify yung nararamdaman ko kasi halo halo na.

Mas masakit pa dahil he is living his best life ngayon habang ako dala dala pa rin ang bigat ng mga pinaggagagawa niya sa akin. I am sharing my story to you hoping na mabawasan yung lahat ng negative emotions na nararamdaman ko kasi after more than 10 years of keeping this secret, at last, I was able to tell someone about it.

I hope y'all have not experienced what I experienced. I hope na hindi niyo siya maranasan ever. Thank you for reading my story.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/10tnkes/young_gullible_and_sexually_abused/,t2_4hqqxdr8q,2023-02-05 02:33:14,7
Simp or abuse of power,"I'm creeped out. I work as a VA sa isang VA agency na sikat dito sa Pinas. Meron akong parang ""team lead"" na nag guide sakin ever since I got in the VA agency. 

Our relationship started very professional, although I was bothered kasi he would call me “dear” lmao kahit sa first few messages sakin dear agad. I noticed after a while he would make remarks na parang he's hitting on me. He would mention that if bagay daw ba ang Aquarius sa Sagittarius and so on. I am in a long term relationship so I immediately snuck in a little remark mentioning that I have a bf (but not directly replying to the “kung bagay ba aquarius sa sagi” which I regret kasi sana sinabi ko na mas bagay sagi at leo) — I'm so disgusted and creeped out at this point (3 months in the VA agency)

Those types of messages would occur at least once every 2 months, and sometimes tinitignan niya profile ko sa tiktok (mind you, I'm a super private person in socmed). He also followed me on ig, I didn’t followback and decided to block him on tiktok and ig because it was making me super uncomfortable. 

He also recently used reddit to post his hinanakit or whatever and sent me the link of that post. But me being a curious person, I checked his profile – lo and behold, may post sa heartbreak subreddit ph addressed to me and how he would wish that in another universe magkatuluyan daw kami 😶

Yesterday, he asked about maya and I just replied as normal. Then a few hours later nagsend ng 1k!? Sobrang uncomfortable sa feeling ng ginagawa niya di ba niya alam yun ugh 

Oh plus, we have one on one meetings and he asked it to be scheduled this Valentine’s day, so I’m planning to change the date because I won’t give him the satisfaction na makakapag zoom meeting kami ng valentines LMAO kami nga ng jowa ko di magdate or meet ng valentines tapos siya oo?? HELL NAW

I just wished he would step down already sa position niya (he has been planning to but has been holding off for whatever reason) para matransfer na ako sa team lead na babae.

I’m so so soooo creeped out and planning to confront him on our 1-on-1 meeting next week, send back the 1k, and let him know that I’m very uncomfortable about him doing that",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1anp8gk/simp_or_abuse_of_power/,t2_7ylhoy7ts,2024-02-11 04:13:45,1

Kapag nag aaway kami ng ex GF ko dati ay palagi nya akong pinag mumura, minamaliit at iniinsulto pati pamilya ko. For the background sya ay nasa mid to high income family exclusive subd may trabaho mama at papa at may maliit na business sa lasalle dasma sya nag college ganon. Tapos ako low to mid income family si papa nag wowork si mama housewife tapos mga kapatid ko nag wowork tulungan lang may sariling bahay naman. 

Kapag nagagalit sya or nag aaway kami palagi nya akong minumura minamaliit sa chat. Palagi nya sasabihin ""bobo mo x"" ""tanga mo d kita kailangan"" ""wag ka na mag try pumunta sa bahay kasi ayaw namin ng bobo"" "" tanga mo talaga"" ""bagay lang sa pamilya mo ganyan kasi bobo kayo"" at mas marami pang masasakit na salita na ayaw ko na lang ishare. Akala ko out of pure rage lang kapag nagagalit sya sakin at ginagawa ko. Pero parang ngayon ko na realize sa current GF ko na parang kahit magalit pala hindi ka mag sasabi ng mga ganong bagay. Lahat talaga ng galit nya binubuhos nya pero that time d ko sya inaaway talaga pag sinasabihan nya ako ng ganon nag sosorry lang ako sa kanya kahit na wala naman ako nagawa na mali ako pa din mag sosorry lang ng mag sorry sa kanya. 

Hindi ko alam if may epekto ba sakin yun sa future ko or sa present ko kasi dun ko naramdaman din na tama nga sya na buti d nya ako nakatuluyan kasi naging failure yung buhay ko. Hindi ako naka graduate ng college unlike sa kanya na nasa abroad na. Alam ko dapat naging fuel ko yun para magpursige pero hindi nangyare yun nung pinagpalit nya ako dun sa bestfriend nya na down ako at nasiraan ng loob kaya din hindi ako naka graduate ng college kasi nahirapan at nawalan ako ng motivation pumasok ng school. 

Gusto ko lang ilabas yung nararamdaman ko kasi never ko pa sya naikwento kahit kanino at dito lang ako nagkaroon ng lakas ng loob ishare kasi baka majudge ako. Kahit matagal na nangyare atleast maishare ko at may makabasa ay kahit papano gumaan ang loob ko. 😊 may GF na din ako ngayon at 3 years na din kami living in more simple life pero alam ko sa sarili ko na mas masaya ako ngayon kesa noon 😊",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/17vn1rw/ngayon_ko_lang_na_naiisip_if_i_was_verbally/,t2_md9srm71m,2023-11-15 13:57:30,11
abusive relatives,"Nakakainis talaga yung mother side relatives ko.. Sa sobrang pagka family oriented nagiging toxic na yung dating. Both mother and father side ko na family nafi-feel ko na feeling nila may kaya kami pero mas mapang-abuso talaga yung mother side ko kasi hindi marunong humindi yung nanay ko. 


Grabe pupunta yung mga yun dito sa bahay walang pasabi tapos dito matutulog. Buti kung isang araw lang magpipirmi dito e hindi, aabutin yan sila ng isang linggo tapos hindi man lang mag-aambag sa pagkain. Hindi kami makape ng mga kapatid ko pero grabe sila umaga, tanghali, gabi full mug na malaki. Nakakaloka din kasi even napkin tuwing andito sila e dito pa kukuha samin. Di na nahiya.

Eto pa, napaka-emotionally and physically absent samin ng mga parents namin lagi silang nasa work tapos kapag uuwi sila sa bahay sobrang gabing-gabi na. Everytime tatawag kami na need namin ng something sasabihin nila busy sila pero kapag kamag-anak ang hihingi ng saklolo e for some reason nagiging readily available agad sila (???)

Sa pera naman, kapag nanghihingi kami magkakapatid lagi nilang sinasabi samin na ""Wala"" pero huhu kapag mga kamag-anak nanghihingi ng pera biglang may mailalabas sila 500, 1000. Jusq.

Tuwing nag-oopen up kami sa nararamdaman namin always nag-eend up sa iyakan at sakitan ng damdamin. Lagi pa nilang sasabihin na ""buti nga yon at kayo ang hinihingian, hindi kayo ang nanghihingi""

NOT EXCEEDING P30K FOR ANIMAL ABUSE???,"just a random rant about how animal abuse is not that considered much of a heavy crime in the ph.

if I were to change something, dapat mas mahabang jail time, mas malaking fine at restriction order na dapat di na pwedeng magkaroon ng pet under them.

PS. Number of strays are increasing because of irresponsible owners. Kahit anong impound gawin ng mga barangay, they will keep increasing as long as there is someone who just let their pet breeds.

[TW SA] I didn't cry after my gf told me that she was sexually abused before.,"So, about a month ago, my girlfriend she revealed that she'd been sexually abused before. I didn't know how to handle it, and it's been weighing on me ever since.

I feel guilty as hell about my initial reaction. My heart was heavy, I was low-key shaking, and I couldn't help but feel angry—for her, for the situation. The thing is, I didn't show any of that. I froze, lost for words, not knowing how to comfort her. I was worried that anything I said might sound cliché or rehearsed, like the standard ""It's not your fault"" or ""Thanks for sharing, it must've been scary."" And I really do care about her; I just wish I could've been there for her in the moment and just held her. 

To make it worse, we're in a ldr, so she shared this over a call. I can't even remember what I said, or if I said anything at all. Instead of offering the comfort she needed, I tried to cheer her up by distracting her and changing the subject, because she'd mentioned before that distracting her helps when she's feeling down. I'm dumb as a fucking rock. 

I've been dwelling on this, feeling guilty and realizing I mishandled the situation. Ever since then, I've been actively practicing how to be better at comforting her and finding the right words to say whenever she shares something with me. But I can't help thinking that I wish I had been more prepared at that time when she told me about it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/180fnpe/tw_sa_i_didnt_cry_after_my_gf_told_me_that_she/,t2_eajjsqtkb,2023-11-21 20:18:04,3
Breaking my silence: Victim of childhood abuse,"Greetings. I have been visiting this site for a while but just signed up now. Besides the fact that I may need therapy, I sort of wonder if there are people here who can relate to this article.  
  
So I'm adopted. And yes I know, blessed, lucky, any of the words that you can think of, yes I've heard it all. But if you're thinking that the reason behind my adoption is infertility issues, it's not. I have an older brother. The legitimate son of my adopted mother. 19 years older than me. I guess I was around 3-4 until I realized that I have a brother because he was away studying in the US.  
  
Being the only kid in the household, I did not have anyone explaining the world that I'm surrounded with. And it became more confusing by the time I was 7, when my brother began to physically, verbally, mentally & sexually abuse me. Again, no one was trying to educate me what is happening, why is he doing this or even why is he being placed in a facility called ""rehab"".  
  
And all I can remember is the abuse that went on until my high school years. My mother on the other hand, also confused on what is happening to her son, just kept sending him back to rehab. Hoping that in every facility they send him to, would finally get him treated and be back to his normal self.  
  
But then I went to college, it was the best 4 years of my life. Because he was sent away once again. I remember the freedom of going out of my room with no fear of him being around. Being able to move, think and enjoy the remaining years of my youth. I did not even think of him, not for one second. I loved my life knowing that I was the only child in the household that time.  
  
This is his 10th year of being home. Diagnosed with schizophrenia with a lifetime medication. And while my mother believes that everything seems to be going well, I on the other hand was left alone to deal with the trauma and brave my way through life up until today. The relationship that I have with my mother is a love-hate thing. In those 10 years, it was filled with non stop arguments. Wanting her to answer questions on whether she thought about my well-being growing up or if she ever thought about the after effects of the abuse I had to endure. In the end, I had no answer and no remorse. Wanting me to just forget it like it never happened and to forgive my brother for he has already been punished by being mentally unstable.  
  
So did I forgive him? No. I will never forgive him, family or no family.  
  
Will I ever forget about it? I don't think so. The trauma never had room to be acknowledged and to heal hence, it stayed with me all these years.  
  
What about your mother? If you mean if I'm just gonna accept her negligence then no. This is also an eye opener to me. I will not let my future child go through this. Ever.  
  
Today I'm 29 years old and a few days ago, we have argued about this once again. This time, I finally felt the exhaustion of arguing & defending myself through the years. I felt a total shift that gave me the courage to break my silence, and to finally distance myself away from my family. For the betterment of my mental health, safety & happiness.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1b2w59i/breaking_my_silence_victim_of_childhood_abuse/,t2_v74ia1lcc,2024-02-29 17:13:56,1
living in an abusive and toxic household,I was around 7 years old nung nakaexperience ako ng physical abuse galing sa dad ko. Naalala ko everytime nangyari galing siya sa work at palagi siyang gabi umuuwi tapos ako naman kakatapos lang ng school ko that time at actually hindi ako sumusunod dati hanggang sa galit na galit dad ko sakin na sinasaktan ako ng mga objects ang sakit sa impact pero wala naman akong sugat or anything. tumagal siya ng 4 years ang pagaabuso di ko alam paano ko nakayanan until ngayon verbally abusive naman siya at nastop na pananakit sakin pero ayun hindi siya healthy. 21 years old na ako pero di pa rin ako makaalis dito.

"Just blockedy abuser, now everybody is asking why?","I got molested as a child by my cousin,. He's 15 years older than me. No one knew because I kept quiet and my mother and her sister ( his mother ) just got reconciled after many years and I dont want to ruin that. Recently he added me on facebook, it took a while before I accepted it and didn't mind cause I'm busy with my work. My mind is at peace for a moment because he lives far away from me. Until I decided to post some of my travel videos and every time he would like every single post. I couldn't stand  him, seeing his face on my notifs. I just blocked him and I thought maybe he wont notice. Then I recieved a friend request from my personal account from him and once more, deleted him. I got a messge from my mom and asking me if I got some beef with him. I cannot think of any answer to that. It really bums when the trauma is crystal clear on your head even thought 26 years have passed. So many things that I kept but I think I'm getting sick being called the blacksheep because I avoid family gatherings or even communicating to them  online. I felt sick to my core that my mother is having a communication with them. Why would just my abuser disappear instead of me. He did something to me and still acting like its nothing like I'm kind of a kid with amnesia. I take grudge why I became anti social beacuse of that. I moved far far away to be at peace and still the demon hunts me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/18n8ss0/just_blockedy_abuser_now_everybody_is_asking_why/,t2_83bz1vzu3,2023-12-21 07:44:18,43
I'm used and abused,"I'm the eldest among my sibs, working in a bank. My dad is seaman malapit na din magretire, while my mom just started her sari sari store business. Yung kapatid kong sumunod sakin may sariling family na, and ang bunso namin nasa highschool pa. The problem is when it comes to credit card or anything na utang sakin lagi nakikisuyo or nakikiride ang family ko. Hindi ko alam bakit minsan feeling ko gipit sila pero may work pa naman dad ko. Nakakapagod lang and stress kasi wala naman ako pang abono lalo na kapag di sila nakakabayad on time. Meron pa ko tito na ginawa kong supplementary ko, ending namax out na nya ang card and nalipat sakin ang balance. 

Yung mom ko and sister ko naman nakiride din sa credit card ko almost 100k+. And nalalate na ngayon ng bayad. Before ko pa sila pahiramin, doubtful na ko dahil knowing them alam kong dadating sa point na malalate ng bayad. Pero di ko sila matiis. So here i am suffering and stressed sa mga utang. Katatapos lang din mapayoff ng loan ko (thru salary deduction) na hiniram talaga ng mom ko pero kahit piso di pa nya ko binabayaran. Di ko alam if nakalimot na or thankyou na lang talaga. 

I want to help them pero inuubos nila ako. I'm already 26, 6 years working in corporate world pero til now wala pa rin savings like zero talaga. Negative pa nga dahil sa dami ng utang at pasuyo sakin ng pamilya ko. Buti sana kung sarili kong utang pero hindi eh. Di ko alam gagawin ko, gusto ko sila icut off sa buhay ko para matahimik na ko.

Good bye mr. Emotionally abusive guy,"Ended my situationship with an older guy a while ago because i couldnt take the disrespect anymore. 

Pag talaga nagagalit ang ibang tao, dun mo sila mas nakikilala. The way they let out their frustrations, the reasons why theyre frustrated, and how they treat people ariund them when theyre frustrated, these things matter and will show eventually. 

I told him ive been surrounded by family members who seem to have anger issues but it turns out ganun din pala siya. It scared me when he became mad out of nowhere and how invalidated my emotions. It was obvious how he tried to manipulate and confuse me into thinking na may nagawa nga akong mali. He also refused to communicate.  He would just say na forget about what happened without even saying sorry of fully talking about what just transpired.

He even tried to threaten me na ibblock ako nung inopen ko ulit yung problem na yun. That moment was my turning point already. Ive realized that time how he’s trying to impose his control over me and our situation. How fucked up he is. I lost all my genuine feelings for him at napalitan ng pure hatred.

Kanina lang, i decided to leave and block him. Good riddance.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/18rcpiv/good_bye_mr_emotionally_abusive_guy/,t2_hf0d4ej40,2023-12-27 01:05:46,11
How I Let Someone Use and Abuse My Kindness. Now I Can't Live with Myself.,"*TLDR: I met this guy on Bumble, we hooked up, became super close, was in very gray area, started a lucrative business together and turns out pineperahan lang pala nila ako ng babae niya.*

[Why am I so Mad at the Girl My Ex Business Partner/Situationship Ended up With](https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1314ixr/why_am_i_so_mad_at_the_girl_my_exbusiness/)

I'm a 35/F. Independent, lived a happy life, and had a lot of advocacies and friends before this whole mess happened to me.

On my 34th birthday, I prayed that I finally meet the *guy* I would spend my life with. At that age, I really was looking for a long-term partner. Sabi ko *Lord, I am healed, my cup is full, and I am ready to trust again.* And it was true, cos it took me roughly 5 years to get over the most abusive relationship I've ever experienced. Binuo ko ulit sarili ko sa wala.

I matched with a couple of guys on Bumble. Madalas AFAM, kasi sawang sawa na ako sa napakataas na beauty standards ng pinoy guys. I don't swipe first, kasi gusto ko yung interesado na sa akin. I check my BeeLine for potential guys.

Sa lahat ng AFAM dun, may isang pinoy guy who stood out because of his tagline. It read: *Help me tell my kids how I met their mother.* Being such a huge fan of HIMYM, nacurious ako. So I swiped on him, and asked him what his favorite food was. Surprisingly, same kami. We both liked Arabic food. *Given I was raised in the middle east.* We had a really nice connection on the app, and he asked me for my number so we can chat on Viber. I was a bit hesitant, but what the heck. I gave him my number.

On Bumble, he told me *he flies planes* for a living. So, cool. Piloto pala siya. But on Viber he told me he sells insurance. I guessed the pandemic did a number on his flying career and he chose to sell insurance instead. We really connected. We have a lot of things in common. *Ultimo starter Pokemon namin pareho. And ngayon lang ako nakakilala na favorite din si Bulbasaur.* But yun, he was fun to talk to, but I wasn't interested. Hindi ko kasi siya type. I felt it was harmless to keep talking to him. But he would message me every day. Consistently.

One night, we ended up flirting with each other and things got a little out of hand. But I told him I don't sleep with guys who aren't my boyfriends. I'm game for anything virtual, cos there are no actual attachments to stuff like that. But he was persistent. My impression of him was he was just another sad boy who isn't over his ex.

Now a little background, after my abusive relationship, I haven't slept with *anyone* in 5 years. And I told him this. I also told him about my insecurities kasi, let's face it. Pinoy guys are very superficial. And I'm not what you'd call their standard of beauty. Pero sabi niya he didn't care if I was fat, he didn't care about my cellulite or stretchmarks. He still wanted to see me.

I don't know if it was cos I was also super *h\*rny* after not being intimate with someone in 5 years. Or talagang magaling siya mag-sales talk. Pumayag din ako. He picked me up from my house and we went to an AirBnB nearby just for seggs. So Fubus kami by definition. He convinced me to delete my Bumble kasi he's all I need na daw. Nagdelete na daw siya ng Bumble a week before, he just wanted to try it out.

We talked a lot. *Mej ang daldal niya kasi*. Naging friends na talaga kami. And yung buong lifestory niya alam ko na. Found out di pala siya completely done with flying school and yun may financial problems.

I manage a team of writers, and asked him kung marunong ba siya magsulat. I offered him a well-paying job. Para lang makapagipon na siya ulit for flight school.

Fast forward to a couple of months later we got really close and eventually took this venture to the next level. We got trained and everything. We opened our business and grabe parang blessed talaga yung union namin kasi sunod sunod yung pasok ng clients. We were making *really* good money.

Thing is, 90% of the work is me. Pero hinayaan ko lang kasi I really enjoyed his company and at this point I was happy I was helping him out. Things started to change when we hired this developer friend of his and we got really close as well. He was starting to be rude to me, and would often get triggered with the slightest things. And I couldn't understand what was happening. Out of nowhere, he told me he wants to stop hooking up. And I was like okay? Not gonna lie, I got hurt cos I felt really insecure about myself and I felt something was wrong with me. But we were still business partners and friends.

I eventually opened up to his developer friend and this guy flat-out told me, *he's using you.* Of course, it is not something you'd like to hear. And I always saw the good in people so I guess that's on me. Months passed and I haven't seen my so-called *business partner/fubu* in a while. And I told him how I felt. I felt that he was hiding from me and it wasn't nice anymore. If he wanted to be a friend. BE A FRIEND.

IDK how, but in between everything I fell in love with this guy and I admitted it. I told him, I'm good with keeping the business. Since we've also involved other people in it. But if he plans to pursue someone else, or he goes back to his ex. Sabihan niya ako para I can leave. Especially kung di naman pala ako ako in the end. That was the agreement talaga. May exit plans kami.

Sabi ko nung birthday ko, the guy *is the guy* if he tells me he prayed for me too. *Kasi nga diba hiningi ko siya kay Lord.* He told me, I was an answered prayer for him. Na araw araw bago kami nagkakilala nagpepray siyang may tutulong sa kanyang bumangon sa kinalalagyan niya.

We went on months and months. Hindi normal yung dynamics namin. We talk every day. He calls me at night. We fight like we're a couple. So dumbass me thought we were headed in that direction. Whenever I feel something off, I would ask him directly; *may iba ba?* And he would always tell me wala. Why am I overthinking, and why am I so worried? He kept telling me things any girl would want to hear; *I want to keep you forever. I don't want to lose you. You are important in my life.* All the bells and whistles with the cherry on top. So yes, it was a *situationship.* And ako hopiang hopia kasi nafifeel mo naman yun eh. Bakit mageeffort sayo yung tao kung wala diba?

November, he asked me permission to go to Cebu on a business trip with this business he had with his co-flying friends. I said no. I said talaga *ayoko*. I said *sige pumunta ka, pero wala ka nang babalikan sa akin*. To which he and his best friend (who secretly knows about us) guilt-tripped me into allowing him to go on December instead. *Maging supportive naman daw ako sa career niya sa aviation.* Naguilty ako siyempre, so um-oo na ako reluctantly. *(This part is a crucial key to this story. Yang lintek na Cebu trip na yan.)*

Last December after preparing for Noche Buena. He called me *Babe.* And I really got upset because tawagan nil ang ex niya yan. And I told him that I didn't want this anymore and that I'm tried of asking for a space in his life when clearly there was none. He begged me for 3 days to forgive him. To take him back. *Dahil marupok tayo, um-oo din ako sa huli*. Dinaan niya kasi ako sa iyak. Hirap na hirap na daw siya, di ko pa din siya pinapatawad. We fixed it and everything was merry and bright again.

January to February. Nahihirapan na talaga ako sa business namin. Aside from the fact na nawalan kami ng clients nung December. He wasn't pulling his weight and I would always do his tasks. I was exhausted. I was already begging him for help, and he always said he had family things going on. So I respected that. *Di ako nagduda for a second because we talk all day, and he calls me at night.*

By February, napansin kong nagdelete na siya ng photos with his ex. And my first thought was *YES! Baka may progress na siya sa pagmove on niya. May chance na*. Pero dahil overthinker ako, bigla ko naisip, baka someone else had him remove those photos. So ako, walang paligoy ligoy. I asked him *May someone else ka ba?* To which he said *Mamatay man tatay ko, walang iba.* But I wasn't convinced. Todo kalkal ako sa FB niya and naghihysterical na ako. I cancelled a huge opportunity to stay with him. And kung may iba pala, sana nagsabi na lang siya para di ko ginawa yun.

He called me that night, and we were probably on the phone for 5 hours arguing about this. And he kept telling me if there was someone else, if he even thinks about that. He'd tell me. Because *according to him* he respects me enough to do that. Eventually, nagbati kami. *Kasi nga marupok ako*. And he agreed to spend my birthday with me.

But from that fight, nothing seemed the same. He wasn't the same. Siyempre kaming mga babae, nakakaramdam naman kami e. And I told him I wasn't feeling secure anymore. Now this guy, is the king of giving assurance. *HALOS EVERYDAY TALAGA,* binibigyan niya ako ng assurance. Kaya di ako ever nagduda until these past few months, kasi ang laki na ng pinagbago niya. And I remember him saying *Ano ka ba, you know I'm staying. I'm staying with you.* Then I said: *Natatakot kasi ako na baka gumising ka next week, tapos ayaw mo na pala at iwan mo ako.* And here again, Mr. Assurance, hindi daw siya ganun and he's not leaving.

March 3 he cancelled on spending the day with me on my birthday. Of course I was upset. Who wouldn't be? Pero siya nagalit. Di daw ako makaintindi. Then ayon na, nasabi niya na yung pinakamasakit na nasabi niya sa akin; *Bakit sino ka ba? Jowa ba kita?* I hung up on him and I was shaking. Una kasi tama siya, di naman ako jowa niya. Pero yung *sino ka ba* part got to me. Kasi hindi biro sinakripisyo ko para sa kanya, his family and friends. Na isang taon sa akin umasa ng income.

March 4 may nakita akong picture na pinost dad niya. Family photo. May babae nakahawak sa braso niya, and I know all his friends and cousins by face. Hindi familiar sa akin yung babae. So I asked his best friend about it and he said: *Ayoko sana manggaling to sa akin, pero yan na yung dinedate niya ngayon.* Take note he is the 1 friend on this guy's side who knows about me and him and our situation. I was shaking and incredibly anxious. I kept calling the guy, and I told him *I need to know the truth. You owe me the truth for once.* Then he replied: *I just want to spend time with my family today. Pinsan ko yan, I don't need to explain anything to you.* Then the best friend also messaged me: *Kaya lagi kayo nagaaway eh kasi tinitrigger mo siya, nakakita ka lang ng picture na may kasamang ibang babae, feeling mo may something na. Pinsan niya lang yan.*

I APOLOGIZED FOR ACTING INSANE. And he said: *Okay na, bati na tayo. Enjoy your birthday tawag na lang ako sayo bukas.* Exactly at midnight he was the first to greet me for my birthday. I asked him what time he'd call me later that afternoon. He said he wasn't in the mood, so wag ako makulit. Not gonna lie, nasaktan nanaman ako. Kasi birthday ko yun eh, can't you suck it up for 5 minutes to give me a call. But di na ako nakipagtalo.

I badly needed help sa business, and he was already out for at least 2 weeks. I was struggling. I gave him a call and updated him with stuff, he didn't sound the same. I asked him if tuloy kami magkita later that week, and all of a sudden sabi niya, he wasn't comfortable with me. And I have no idea where the hell that came from. So I thought it was about the picture, and how I acted. Needless to say, he stopped answering my calls and answering my texts. Even when it was about business.

I didn't know why I was being punished. Eventually, everything unfolded. Yung babae sa picture. Girlfriend na niya. He also met her on Bumble, so bullshit yung nagdelete siya nung nagkita kami. Yung trip sa Cebu, was so he could meet her in person, hindi business venture. December pa lang sila nagmeet in person, pero binahay niya agad. When all the while, ako naghihintay maka-move on siya sa ex and maging ready to commit. He kept me this whole time, made me believe in his promises of staying and never leaving.

Nung nahuli na siya sa lahat, I confronted him in person. All he did was blame me. *Ginawa ko to dahil ikaw. Nagsinungaling ako dahil sayo.* And I felt so broken. Nalaman ko eventually he's been telling lies about me. Saying I was his *obsessed boss*. Binobola niya lang daw ako pero nainlove and obsessed ako sa kanya. He denied na we had seggs and everything in between. Sa inis ko, I felt the need to clear my name. I compiled all our messages that shows na this was not just my imagination. I sent it to his family and the girl. Then blocked him everywhere.

He apparently was so stressed out that he started puking and crying non-stop. He asked his other friend to call me, and of course I answered cos I didn't have beef with that other friend. When I did, it was him. He asked if we could talk, and I told him *you had your chance to talk to me nicely last night, and now that chance is gone.* Nabitawan ko na din mga salitang: *Proud ka ba sa sarili mo na pinandate at motel mo sa babae mo, galing sa perang pinagpuyatan and paguran ko?* He was explaining himself and everything. He asked to see me. Then I said okay, kasi sa totoo lang gusto ko siya sampalin kaya ako um-oo. When he got here. I didn't expect him to be so remorseful. He went on his knees and begged me to forgive him. He was hugging me and I was already bawling kasi, I love this idiot. Of course nasasaktan din ako na nasasaktan siya. We agreed to fix things, especially sa business end.

But apparently he's been crying palagi sa bahay and his mom told his friend *di naman namin kailangan yung pera sa negosyo na yan.* Which hurt me a lot. Because yung pera sa negosyo namin bumuhay sa kanila ng isang taon. Balik nila kung di nila kailangan. She put it as if kawawa yung anak niya. Eh ako yung niloko and pinerahan? The last time he came here was March 18, and I was expecting an apology, kasi he wasn't *again* helping out sa work, and I was drowning. But he came here to say goodbye and iba na yung aura niya. Hindi na remorseful, mayabang na. I was so mad. Kasi bakit pa siya bumalik balik at nagluluhod luhod sa harap ko para lang iwan ako? Ano yun? To get the upper hand? I found myself broken again. Sana hinayaan na lang niya ako sa galit ko. Kasi I was done na eh. Pero binabalik balikan niya ako.

Turns out, planado na nila ng babae niya gawin 'to. We're not talking small money here. In the span of 8 months, I sent him over $20,000 *yes USD yan.* Hindi pa kasama yung mga local clients namin. Profit sharing sa business namin, kahit sa isang buwan 12 hours lang siya magtrabaho or even less. Magbill pa yan sa client ng higher hours kahit wala naman siyang nagawa. I wouldn't even get my cut sa other clients kasi I felt he needed it more than I did. I was under the impression I was building something with this guy. Yun pala nag tandem sila ng babae niya para maperahan ako.

Araw araw mula noon, gusto ko na lang mamatay. Kasi kasalanan ko ba't ako nasa position na to. Kasalanan kong nagpaloko ako, kasalanan kong nagpauto ako sa kanya, kasalanan ko every time na gusto ko siya iiwan nagpapasuyo naman ako, at kasalanan kong binigay ko lahat kahit wala namang kahit ano kundi assurance every day. But people can lie about that.

Hirap na hirap akong ishare sa iba 'to kasi, sasabihin lang sakin *move on*. Pero hindi madali eh. Di ako nahihirapan kasi pinagpalit niya ako sa cheap and easy. Nahihirapan ako kasi ang dami kong nasayang... I can't live with myself knowing I did this *TO MYSELF.*

***TW: Suicide***

*Why am I sharing this?*

1. Hiyang hiya ako sa sarili ko na I stayed this long with him, and I agreed to be given breadcrumbs of affection. *Ganun ata talaga when you come from a home with narcissist parents any sprinkle of attention is more than enough.* And I'm smart. Lagi niya nga sinasabi ang talino ko e. Pero napakabobo ko sa pagibig, especially this time. I helped this guy get up and out of his rut, para lang sa ibang babae.
2. I feel guilt everytime I see my sister, sana yung perang tinulong ko sa guy na to, tinulong ko nalang sa kapatid ko and pareho kaming nakamigrate na.
3. I can't even look at myself in the mirror. Sinisisi ko sarili ko na I put myself in this situation. Di nagkulang friends ko sa payo e. Pero blinded ako sa love ko for him. Sobrang blinded to the point na nagagalit na ako pag sinasabihan siya ng anything negative.
4. I closed my other businesses that I loved so much to focus on this business with him, and I feel I wasted so much. The amount of sacrifices I had to make, yung pagod at puyat ko? Hindi makatarungan.
5. I am desperate to off myself. Kundi lang ako duwag I would've slashed my carotid days ago. Hindi ko na kaya mabuhay every day with this regret and pain. Iba yung sakit na nararamdaman ko. One of these days, my depression will win and that's just it.

I used to think people who commit suicide are selfish. Di iniisip yung mga nagmamahal sa kanila. Now I'm in that position... I understand. When you dug a hole so deep, you have no way out, you just want to stop everything and not exist anymore so the pain stops. Di ako takot mamatay eh. Takot akong mabuhay ng araw araw ako umiiyak dahil daw bwisit na panlolokong ginawa sa akin at sa lahat ng regret na nararamdaman ko.

Pinag palit ako sa Abuser niya.,"Tago nalang natin siya sa pangalang Cath, typikal sa babae, hindi maarte sa kolorete at kung ano anong pinapahid sa muka, matalino at mabait. Weve been together for almost 6 years, until nag trabaho siya sa isang massage parlor sa Angeles City. Ayoko sana siya pag trabahuhin talaga don pero ayoko naman isipin niya na kinocontrol ko siya. After all matatanda naman na kame at malaki ang tiwala ko sakanya at sabi naman niya na kasama niya ang hipag niya sa trabaho na yun. 

To make the story short, shes been SA ng isang client, nung una hinahawak hawakan lang siya pero nagagalit daw siya (Nag kwento naman siya sakin about dito) so nag decide na ako na wag na siya pag trabahuhin don. Dahil maayos naman ang sweldo at di naman na talaga niya kailangan mag trabaho dahil may sarili na akong bahay at maayos na trabaho. Inaya ko siya to live together at pumayag naman siya. After few months passed tinawagan siya ng dati ""daw"" niyang boss sinasabi na kulang sa tao kasi mag ber months na. So sinabi naman niya sakin at shempre ang una kong reaksyon ay ""NO"" pero nag insist siya. Ilang araw at weeks din ang lumipas na pinag uusapan namen tong bagay na to. Pero nanatili ako sa desisyon ko na hindi. Pero ayun na nga sinabi na niya ang magic words na pilit kong iniiwasan ""Di ikaw ang may hawak ng buhay ko, hayaan mo ako mag desisyon sa buhay ko."" Cut the story na ulit,wala ako nagawa hinayaan ko siya, hindi nag tagal 2 weeks after niya umalis para mag trabaho, umuwi siya sa bahay ng umiiyak. Sorry siya ng sorry pero ayaw niya sabihin kung bakit siya nag sosorry. Ako naman comfort lang kahit di ko alam nangyari pero ang nasa isip ko ay meron na naman nangyari di maganda.

Sobrang curious ko nung natutulog siya pinakialaman ko phone niya (Oo na alam ko, mali). Dun ko nabasa na hindi pala yung boss niya ang nag papunta sakanya sa trabaho kundi yung client niya na umabuso sakanya. Dun siya nag stay sa bahay ng abuser niya ng 2 weeks. Pilit kong pinaexplain sakanya na bakit naman pumunta pa siya e may previous na nang yaring di maganda. Eto na ang una't huling sentence na narinig ko sakanya mula nung umuwi siya dahil nag pantig na talaga ang tenga ko, ""may offer siyang malaking pera for 2 weeks"".

Hindi ako nakatulog nung gabi na to, until now hindi ko padin maayos ang pag tulog ko. Nag usap kame at inopen ko sakanya to pero iyak lang siya ng iyak. Pinaalis ko muna siya sa bahay ko at kinausap ang magulang niya.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/16xrx15/pinag_palit_ako_sa_abuser_niya/,t2_iwxtvhjkf,2023-10-02 17:16:04,8
Verbally abusive girlfriend,"I got fed up with my verbally abusive girlfriend. Palagi nalang ako sinasabihan ng mga masasamang bagay kapag galit siya. Kahit na out of topic, sinasabihan parin akong walang kwenta, mamatay na daw ako, mahina sa kama, nabubulol, walang kaibigan, pangit, masama ang ugali, kinocompare sa mga ex at ibang lalaki, etc. Kapag fed up na ako at hindi ko na pinapansin, sinasabi niya na “joke” lang daw yun. 

Tapos nakakalungkot lang kasi ang sabi lang sakin ng mga kaibigan ko na “normal” lang yun sa babae at huwag nalang daw pansinin. Hindi ako sumasangayon sa kanila kasi kahit anong sitwasyon, mali talaga ang verbal abuse. 

For the guys, naexperience niyo rin ba magkaroon ng verbally abusive na girlfriend? Nag ooverthink lang ba ako?

Thanks for the support and advice everyone. Nakipag break na ako sa kanya. I’m doing well and okay. Thank you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/twx0v5/verbally_abusive_girlfriend/,t2_4cqm0kn2,2022-04-05 23:03:57,62
FINANCIAL ABUSE = DOMESTIC ABUSE,"This story was posted from my cousin with permission. She doesn't have Reddit, but she's considering it after introducing this wonderful ~~(and sometimes downright upsetting)~~ app to her. This shit happened around 8 years ago.

May husband yung relative namin na financially irresponsible (and downright criminal) pero ipapasalo yung payments sa asawa at anak. kukuha ng investment/loan tapos kapag di kaya panindigan, ang sasalo ay yung asawa at anak. palagi na lang ibabato yung financial burden sa kanila. umabot sa point na tumakas yung asawa tapos naiwan yung family niya na walang pera halos. we had to help them out. and that help involved counselling to end the abusive cycle of financial irresponsibility. compound na din natin na womanizer si manong tapos kapag may problema sila nung kalaguyo, babalik siya sa real family niya.

the final straw broke when said husband was under arrest for a financial lawsuit. the family, still helped him by settling with the individuals involved, lawyer fees, and other payments involved in legal cases. he was set free. the charges were dropped. and the husband continued to live happy...

or so he thought.

finally napuno yung family niya - the wife and her kids really stood up and chose to leave him under the bus. hiniwalayan ni wife yung asawa, tapos yung mga anak nag-uphold din ng boundaries, kung saan they only see him during holidays for bonding.

siyempre bilang typical Pinoy father, gaslighting galore siya tapos siniraan pa niya sa family namin yung asawa at anak. edi mas nagmukha siyang kontrabida. he even went to my parents to badmouth them, not knowing na alam namin ang buong story + we encouraged them to stand up to him.

unfortunately, his side of the family hates him too kasi user and swindler siya. he has a history of stealing and swindling since his teen years daw kaya nobody trusts him. ang ginawa na lang ng family niya is they gave him a small plot of land with a small house para dun daw siya titira so he won't bother anybody again. the only relative he has contact with is his older sister who puts him in his place when he acts a fool.

unfortunately, even after his family left him, nababalitaan namin na he still continues his lying and ripping people off. umabot sa point na ginawang character reference yung older son niya sa isang loan without his consent. from that point, the cousins stopped all communication with the dad. also they consulted with a lawyer about their financial protection. baka daw madawit silas a utang na di naman nila hiningi, sa kaso na wala silang kinalaman, or sa kabalastugan na di sila kasama.

dun ko lang narealize on my end na sobrang daming forms of abuse.

financial abuse is one of them, wherein a spouse creates a situation in which their partner is rendered unable to financially improve themselves due to deliberate misuse of funds which may involve using credit cards without permission, placing contractual obligations on the spouse without consent, and gambling with family assets, among others [(read more here at Women's Aid UK)](https://www.womensaid.org.uk/information-support/what-is-domestic-abuse/financial-abuse/)

Tandaan niyo, any form of abuse...

# YOU WILL NOT FUCKING TOLERATE

This includes financial abuse. If you see a pattern of behavior in which your partner habitually creates a situation which misuses financial resources, leaves you with the burden, then refuses to help you with this problem by ghosting you or denying blame through gaslighting, proceeds to warm up to you once the issue is done, then repeats the fucking cycle all over again...

Then you should consider contacting a lawyer about this. You can also contact DSWD or Commission on Human Rights regarding this issue.

Have a happy holiday!

P.S. my cousin's family is planning to enjoy their holiday next week in South Korea because they don't have any POS father pulling their financial status down.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/zqm83i/financial_abuse_domestic_abuse/,t2_13bu98,2022-12-20 19:40:12,8

(28F) Napakahirap growing up with an abusive father.,"The violent and sudden angry outbursts I witnessed since I was a child, yung mom ko battered wife due to his paranoia (napaka seloso), nakatikim kaming magkakapatid ng physical abuse kahit walang dahilan para ikagalit niya. Noon inisip ko tuwing ma tri-trigerred siya maging violent na sana mas mabuti pa walang ama kaysa ganoon, noong nilayasan namin siya ilang beses hindi na sana nakipag reconcile mom ko everytime na susuyin niya kami for the sake of not being called ""a broken family"". Eh di sana happy kami na wala siya sa buhay namin, may freedom from emotional harm at wala ng source of misery.

Mahirap especially as a babae ma re-realize mo na kaya pala na a-attract mo ay yung mga cheaters, uncaring, heartless partners kasi deep inside your subconscious yun ang alam mong ""love"" growing up.

2 weeks ko na napapaniginap abusive ex ko,"He was my last ex, and I considered the love of my life. Shit happens and he became abusive to me verbally, emotionally, and during the last few weeks physically na rin. He blamed his Bipolar disorder, but I’ve already had it since he never seemed genuinely apologetic. It’s been almost a year of no contact, and a shitstorm breakup and moving out (magkalive in kami before) and I’ve been dreaming about him nonstop for the past 2 weeks.

I always think of it time to time. His face, the way he grin, especially his touch. I was diagnose with depressive disorder. The medicine helps. And it happen again, same routine. But I did something far braver; I almost committed suicide. To end this misery... to forget. I made an attempt to jump off a bridge, but I was unsuccessful. To realize that... It's not the end of my story. I haven't provide better life for my grandparents. I miss my dogs. I miss the smell of my books. I miss sunset. I miss coffee. The realization hits.

My family is siding with someone who abused me and wants me to not file a case,"TW >!Attempted Sexual Assault and Financial Abuse!<

&#x200B;

On the outside, it looks like I have a decent family who I help with (mostly financially).  I voluntarily helped because as young as 15 I had to take jobs to help support them financially, that's how they raised me, I have to sacrifice my needs and prioritize everyone else before even daring to think of myself. It's a huge extended family too, think 35++ members.

&#x200B;

If I don't prioritize someone else, I'm the worst scum of the earth. I've only recently found out that what they're doing to me is financial abuse. I've always known that they are emotionally and verbally abusive, but the finance thing is a recent thing that clicked in my brain.

&#x200B;

My mom pressured me for almost a decade to take care of her brother. She insists that we're the only family he has (despite him having a living wife, 3 adult children plus 1-3 illegitimate minor kids). He claims he's separated (but actually not). My mom travels a lot for work and is abroad about 9-11 months of of the year.  I ended up stuck with him. He lives in our house with everything free + my mom sends him an allowance.

&#x200B;

I've always kept track when he comes home drunk. He breaks stuff, he berates me, he steals my money, jewelry, phone etc. I have always begged mom to kick him out but she insists he's her brother so he stays. I was told I need to learn some compassion and start caring about my elders.

&#x200B;

It kept on escalating. From ashtrays being thrown, to dishes, to pots, to even breaking our windows. I kept reporting to my mom, she ignored my pleas for help. I was getting decent salary but couldn't save because he'd break my stuff if I don't give him ""his cut"" of my salary. After a few years of work, my boss gave me a raise. He has suspicions on how my life is at home so we made a deal about getting me a house.

&#x200B;

I wanted to move out but my mom kept on guilt tripping me to stay. Uncle escalated worse during the pandemic. With my friends and coworker's urging, I finally got my house furnished since last ber months.

&#x200B;

I guess my uncle figured out I'll be gone soon. He tried to SA me. I thought I won't see the next day, he had that look in his eyes that once he's done with me, I'll be permanently gone. He always hated me because he had to share mom's salary to me. I don't get his logic he's been stealing a good chunk of my salary anyways. I tried to make everything online for a few times but he breaks stuff like our windows if I don't give him ""his cut"". It became a bigger expense that giving him ""his cut"".

&#x200B;

My family has minor political ties, I tried reporting what happened to me. Family minimized it. Says it didn't end up happening, I'm safe, what am I making a fuss about. They blocked me from going to the police or even the barangay. They called in advanced so I won't be accommodated.

&#x200B;

I went through a friend who got me a private lawyer. They got wind of it and are now saying they'll throw me in jail for perjury, defamation, whatever they can think of to shut me up so I don't ruin my uncle's life.

&#x200B;

I had a breakdown yesterday in a family meeting.

&#x200B;

No empathy for me. I was told to stop the dramatic act and start acting like an adult. Stop being dramatic. I'm heartless for even thinking of going to a lawyer. I was told I'm abusing his family because I'm tearing them apart. I feel so helpless. I can't believe I'm getting more care from co workers over my own family who I sacrificed so much for I helped a good chunk of them financially by juggling what's left for me, sometimes even getting into debt to help them out. But in this time of need, I'm nothing but garbage to them. I can't accept help from friends bc they get harassed too.

&#x200B;

I don't even wanna end my life out of spite because I'm sure they'll just party with my life insurance payout.

&#x200B;

Edit for some clarifications : The huge extended family varies on financial capability. Grandparents did their best, but more than half of their kids blew it up, including abusive uncle. Mom and a couple other siblings are doing well money wise, so I usually get contacted for financial help.

March 6 update : I have senior dogs and a cat, I guess I have to accept that I'm not seeing them anytime soon. Or at all. I was able to sneak them out to a friend's house before the meeting in the barangay, friend is a cat-lover so she's keeping my cat. The senior dogs will go together to my boss' relatives' home. They said they'll foster for now but are willing to adopt if I can't take them back. 

They were able to get my passport from the office lockers, IDK why I didn't bring my bag I take as hand carry home but I'm thankful I didn't.

I'm taking chances on how slow the legal system is, maybe I'd still be able to leave if I try now. Fight or flight? I hate taking the flight option but in this case it looks like I'm going to fight a losing battle. It's better to leave.

My boss said he'll rent out my house and try to find out a way to send me money. I told him he should be ready to face some of my relatives who would look at what's happening to me as a sign that they'll have a free house to stay in. He said he's so pissed on my behalf that he'll happily take that challenge.

Well, here's to hoping I can still leave


Update March 8.
I decided to not leave the country. Baka kasi lumabas sa judge na tumatakas ako because of guilt. I decided to retain a lawyer. 

I'll continue being on the move cities to cities until the time I have to face them in person.

My boss is getting more harassments so even tho he was refusing, I asked him to terminate my employment. He told me he will welcome me back when things settle.

One of the things they were harassing him for is the address and keys to my house. He said no. 

We'll have to figure out the best way to deal with that house, boss still wants to hold it for me and said I can pay the 75% difference if I still want it later.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/11icoqz/my_family_is_siding_with_someone_who_abused_me/,t2_vhu8iwgx,2023-03-05 04:44:42,14

I realized I'm an abusive parent.,"Wall of text ahead. 

Hindi ko alam kung saan ako magsisimula pero narealize ko lately na isa akong abusive na magulang. Lumaki akong maraming issue sa buhay at hindi ganun kaayos ang childhood ko, hindi naging maganda ang trato sa aking mga kapatid ko while growing up na nadala ko sa pagtanda, sa madaling salita madami akong emotional baggage. 

Fast forward sa ngayon, isa along single parent to a preteen kid. Madalas ko syang mapagbuhatan ang kamay at mapalo sa mga maliliit na bagay na pwede ko namang maiwasan pero hindi ko mapigilan. Hindi ko alam kung paano ko titigilan iyon. 

Madalas ako nati trigger ako kapag nagdadabog sya, kapag hindi niya nakuha yung gusto niya at kapag may ginawa syang ayoko. Sobrang maiksi ang pisi ko. Since dalawa lang kami sa buhay, araw-araw tablet ang palagi niyang hawak o kaya cellphone ko. Wala siyang kalaro dahil wala ng bata dito sa lugar namin at wala din kaming kasama ng kamag-anak, wala na akong magulang at hindi kami in good terms ng mga kapatid ko mula pagkabata. 

Lately sobrang stressed ako sa mga bagay dahil ako lang ang kumikilos para sa amin dalawa (malamang) at wala akong masyadong nakukuhang tulong sa tatay niya, wala din akong kaagapay sa mga gawaing bahay at sa pagpapalaki sa bata. Kapag galit ako, lahat ng mga masasamang bagay, ultimo mura sinasabi ko sa harapan niya na may kasamang palo o sampal. Tapos kapag nahimasmasan na ako, nakakaramdam ako ng awa sa kanya. Hindi niya deserve maging anak ko. Hindi nya hininging ipanganak sa mundo para lang maging nanay ako. 

Alam kung kailangan ko ng tulong pero hindi ko alam saan magsisimula, saam hihingi ng tulong at kanino magsasabi kaya hanggang ngayon, kinikimkim ko nalang sa akin sarili ko ang problema dahil wala akong makausap. Hindi na dapat magpatuloy to dahil hindi ako magandang example at all.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/14g7ghh/i_realized_im_an_abusive_parent/,t2_42az7zvc,2023-06-23 00:04:06,6
Dealing with Cancer and Drug Abuse in the Family,"My father(55) just got diagnosed with Cancer, Stage 3. Nakaschedule na for Total Laryngectomy by next week. It’s been a roller coster of emotions for the rest of the family, from being told he needed the surgery asap, tapos biglang hindi, tapos ngayon certain na ulit na kailangan. Nagulat lang kami bigla, dahil before christmas lang namin to pinagdaanan lahat. So less than 2 months pero grabe na windang na napagdaanan ng buong pamilya. Super close kasi kami lahat. Ngayon yung older brother(31) ko yung pinaka nakaka trigger sakin, kasi imbis na makatulong sa pamilya dumadagdag lang talaga siya sa stress. Dati pa siyang “recovering” adik, pero sa personal na opinion ko never niya ginusto baguhin sarili niya. Ngayon pikon ako kasi nakikisabay pa siya. And yung mga comments niya runong runungan eh wala naman siya sa mga moments na kailangan siya. Instead what he does is tinatake niya yung opportunity na yun para mag gago pa lalo. Mas bata ako sakanya, pero nakaka trigger kasi na immaturity lang nagddrive sakanya and selfishness. 

I can say loud and proud na lahat na ng pagiintindi ginawa ko. So pls don’t come at me na intindihin ko lang siya. And before you suggest na umalis na ako, I am fortunately and unfortunately the glue that keeps the family together. Broken family rin kasi na mahabang kwento.

Yung gusto ko lang talaga sabihin dito is napakaselfish ng kapatid ko. Kasi sober or not, pinipili niya maggago at magdroga, kumbaga makidagdag sa problema ng pamilya kaysa naman makatulong or wag nang dumagdag. wala ang lungkot lang.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1aekes7/dealing_with_cancer_and_drug_abuse_in_the_family/,t2_oikex0gga,2024-01-30 17:20:57,1

I was clinically diagnosed with MDD last 2019, then PTSD a year after. I'm still on medications up to this day. 

So ito na nga ang tea, nung sinabi ko sa relatives ko kung anong nangyari, ayaw nilang kasuhan ko si abuser. Kasi nga pinsan ko raw, kamaganak ko raw. Pangalan namin masisira. Gusto nalang nila na palayasin at hindi na mag pakita yung taong yon sa bahay namin. Ako naman si tanga umokay nalang sa terms na yun kasi anong magagawa ko, adults sila ako bata pako nun.

Nag salita na ako ngayon sa tita ko, sinabi ko na ang bastos at ang insensitive ng ginagawa nila knowing na up to this day nag susuffer parin ako sa nangyari sakin. Nireplyan ba naman ako na ""gusto mo suntukin siya o sipa-sipain para mawala na galit mo"" 

MISS MA'AM IT DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT.

I probably saw my abuser before,"nakita ko ata siya, and he was looking at me rin kanina. natakot ako, but I am with a friend so I remained ""normal"". I hope hindi ko na ulit siya makita. 

I spent a kot of time being disgusted and hating myself, because of that person. I don't know, but I feel na hindi naman na ako galit, it's just that I feel bad for my childhood self, ang dami niyang pinagdadaanan and she was a child... suffering on her own.

Lumaki ba kayo sa abusive na household?,"

Hi, 19 F. Akala ko dati normal lang sa isang family ang ginagawa samin. Gusto ko lang mag-rant kung gaano ka-toxic sa bahay namin at kung gaano ko na gustong bumukod. Nag-aaral ako ngayon, and grateful ako kay mama at sa stepdad ko for giving me the opportunity to study. Since college na, all of us naman aware na na napaka hirap talaga mg college life, di na pwede pa-petiks-petiks, kailangan na talaga ng hardwork para magbunga pagod mo. 

Onting story-time, nunf g7 ako, binubugbog ako ng lola ko. 50 plus pa siya no’n,lasinggera at sugarol siya. Actually nung gr6 ako, sakanya kami hinabilin ni mama kase aabroad si mama. Kaso hindi din nakayanan tumura ng lola ko sa bahay ng stepdad ko (marami siyang kemerut na ayaw sa stepdad ko kaya nilayasan namin). Di nya sinama yung dalawang batang step sister ko non, ako at ang pwd ko lang na sister ang sinama nya pauwi sa bahay nya (may amats pa siya nung umuwi kami). Araw araw nyakomg sinasaktan no’n, to the point na sinasabihan siya ng mga kapitbahay namin na dalaga na apo mo sinasaktan mo po. Lahat naman ng utos nya non sinusunod ko. Pero may time na hindi kase 9pm palang pinagsasainf nya na ako, sabi ko naman sakanya non na tatambay muna ako saglit sa kaptid nya kase maaga pa. Me and my other lola, were havin a great time ng pinalo nya sa bibg ko yung cane nya. Nagulat ako at umiyak nalang pauwi, pag uwi ko naman ano-anong masasakit na sakita yun binibitawan nya sakin. Kinagabihan, natulog na ako ng maaga kasealam kong lasinf nanaman uuwi si lola. And tama nga ako, naglakasing siya kase di sakanya dunadaan yung padala ni mama. At ayun binugbog nya ako, i was crying for help non and timong i-uumpog nya ulo ko sa upuan. Lulunurin ako sa baha (baha non samin) or ihahagis ako sa ilog. Kayang kayang gawin yon ni lola sakin kase patpatin lang ako noon. And i thiught that will be my last day, unti my other lola and lolo saved me. And ff, napunta na costudy ko sa kanila. Ff hanggang matapos ako ng jhs yung lola ko na nanakit sakin, we never talked. Until nung pandemic, umuwi siya sa house ng stepdad ko, dun na din kase ako mag stay since my siblings needs me. 

Buhay namin magkakapatid napaka-ayos nung kami-kami lang. tahimik sa bahay, no shouting, medyo late lang kumain kase di kaagad nakakapamalengke si papa pero di kami nagugutom. 

Ayun nga tumira na siya samin and our nightmare started…

Since napaka busy ko na student, running for dl kase ako, gisto ko kase masulit ni mama yung gastos nya sakin. Though there are times na di ak nakakakilos sa bahay, since panganay nga, dapat sakin daw lahat ng trabah kahit nag-aaral ako. Mind you guys 10 kami sa bahay ngayon, lahat ng chores pinaghahatian namin. 

Mostly lola toka nya yung pagluluto, minsan ako,minsan kapatid ko at minsan yung tito ko. 

Sa paglalaba, kapag may pasok ak hindi ako nakakatulng, pero during our oc classes, ineensure ko na di na kikilos si lola. 

Pagwaealis and mapping younger sister at cosin ko na nakatoka don. 

Dishes, ako na at ang sister ko. 

As soon as possible ayoko na pakilusin si lola kase sinusumbat nya lang samin yung mga ginagawa nya. Pero no choice ako, kase minsan  di ko talaga magawa lahat ng yan lalo na busy ako Sa school. 

Grateful naman ak na inaalagaan kami ni lola pero at the same time ayaw ko na siya dito kase sinusumbat nya lahat samin and at this age nasasaktan pa din nya kami. 

Grabe nya din. Credit na sakanya lang daw lahat ng task sa bahay na wala daw kaming ginagawa at ginagawa daw namin siyang yaya. 

Kanina nagsumbong mga kapatid ko sakin na napaso daw si lola havang nagluluto, sabibnya wala daw akong kwenta kase di ko daw magawa yang magluto. Guys mga oras na yn nasa school pa ako, ang out namin 8pm na. Gust nyata ni lola na kahit nasa school ako yung kamay k nagluluto sa bahay HAHAHAHAH. 

Kanina gusto nyako pagsipa-sipain di nya magawa kase walang ilaw at di ako makita. Kahit ano an masasakit na sakita na sinasabi nya kanina sakin di k nalang pinapansin kase sanay na din ako sakanya sa raw araw na pag gaganyan nya samin. 

Kaya minsan gusto kona matapos kaagad ng pag aaral para makabukod at mag trabaho na at ng di ko na muli maranasan ang ganitong environment. 

Nakakainggit yung mga students na aral nalang ang iniiisi at wala ng ganito pa. 

Nakakatakot din kase unti unti ng na aaddopt ng mga kapatid ko yung ugali dito sa bahay. 

Nakakapagod na din na parang wala lang sakanya mga ginagawa namin dito sa bahay. 

Ganyan ba talaga mga lola? Akala ko they are supposed to be caring gentle and loving. Sadly di ganyan lola namin e. 

Nagpapakatatag nalang ako para sa mga kapatid at mama ko.

"I was abused when I was kid, and i felt it made me who I am today and i hate it. i hate who i turned into.","i have been abused many times from when i was kid to high school.
first time was when i was 5 or 6 yrs old, with a family member.
then by my brother's older friend who forced to strip me when i was 8 or 9 while i was studying alone in our house.
then by a family friend and his companion when i was 8 or 9 in one of our annual summer/holy week vaca in their house in the province.
then by a high school senior, when i was a sophomore.

i cant even recall some and i felt i got used to it. ive kept it part of my deepest darkets secrets. all my abusers are male, and tbh i mightve forgotten to list others here which ive been erasing from my head.these are the ones that really pinned. it felt like i was an abuser magnet. these are different people. i am straight or at least i thought growing up. i never seduced or have shown any motive for them to make their 'abuser' moves. it turned out normal for me and at some point made me start liking both males and females.ive always been shy and aloof and wasnt communicating to my family at all as it was never our norm.then i have disconnected socially in high school.but i wasnt gay or have been involved or linked to any male companion, i even courted girls in HS. when i was in college i became different. from a social outcast/introvert to an extrovert.i was in a circle of all straight guys.but i had a relationship with another male friend, as in romantic relationship.ive always been alone as i was left by my family and i dont have anywhere to go during sembreak and he was the one who have stayed with me.through him i was able to understand that someone cares for me.and i felt i was loved which i didnt even get from my family.well my mom left me (for her new husband), and my siblings who are yrs older have left home for their own families, leaving me and my father who's always an MIA for work so it was all me alone almost my whole life. it was sad but ive enjoyed my own ways. that relationship lasted for more than a year and i was happy until we broke up.after that i never had any romantic relationship again. no one knew that weve been together even until his death. ive still kept it a secret. even people surrounding me knows im straight but for sure they have an idea that my sexuality is fluid. im casually having sex both men and women and i find it normal but all kept in secret.
im still single today and i hate how i turned into as a person as my friends have families on their own but here i am wont even come out of my shell as someone who's fluid.someone whom they might not understand because of my deepest darkest secrets.
sometimes i even ask, why did all those happen to me? have i had a choice? why didnt i get to push for those choices when i was still a kid? my fate couldve been changed. but so sad it is what it is.i had suicidal thoughts many times over especially in college but every time there's always that enlightenment moment to not to do it. i hope i get to reveal all these secrets one day coz it is just so painful to bear.i no longer cry but it was so fucken heavy i felt it was all the reasons why no one understands me. sigh. ps i was straightforward typing this while it gets into my thoughts so forgive my grammar/english lol",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1b1gp5o/i_was_abused_when_i_was_kid_and_i_felt_it_made_me/,t2_p6zrbhbp,2024-02-28 00:54:10,2
My abuser will be my neice's godparent,"Hindi ko alam kung ano ang dapat maramdaman. We are currently planning my neice's binyag and I recently learned from my sister that she chose the person who SA-ed me when I was a kid to be one of her daughter's godparents. I'm not the biggest fan of Catholicism pero allowed naman akong malungkot diba?

What's worse is alam naman ng family ko na ginawa niya iyon sa akin. It's probably one of the reasons why I'm mentally ill as well. But my sister still keeps in touch with them tapos ngayon ginawa pang godparent. Isang abuser talaga yung napili mong magiging tagapangalaga ng anak mo kung may nangyari sayo noh? Pakiramdam ko tuloy hindi sila naniniwalang nangyari yon sakin. 

I love my neice to bits pero nawalan ako ng gana sa okasyon at isa pa ako sa mga namamlano ng binyag. Sobrang bigat sa pakiramdam. I feel betrayed kahit hindi ko naman anak iyon. Tama lang naman malungkot/mainis diba? Hindi ko naman sila pipigilan dahil choice nila iyon. I just hope they really thought about it.

Verbally Abusive Mom - My First Bully,"For 23 years, just this once I want to let it out.

My mom hurt me, before any person ever had the chance to do so. 

My awareness was opened after I watch the Tangled movie, and how I was similar to Rapunzel, and my mom is definitely the mother who kidnapped her. I was not allowed to leave home, play with friends, or even have my own opinion. I was brainwashed into thinking nobody will love me because I was unattractive and ugly. (at first I thought it was just a parent being strict, but now I'm a  working adult, the verbal abuse still continue)

We even got into an argument, how I confronted her how she is my first bully. And she got furious, saying I was lucky that she does hit me or anything and I should be grateful for the sacrifices she gave me (talk about gaslighting) And instead of saying sorry after always screaming painful words at me, she will just buy me bags, food etc. (talk about manipulation)


My mom is definitely showing symptoms of being narcissist (I'v noticed this since I was 7), she was verbally abusive, never happy for achievements (despite graduating with good grades, I don't party, drink or smoke, passed the board exam with a high board rating) always calls me ugly, 'maitim', and the most painful one, "" Walang magmamahal sayo kasi pangit ka.""

I have obvious symptoms of depression and anxiety (but I still haven't went to see a doctor), I've attempted 7 times already because of how painful her words are. My dad is basically an enabler and does not even care. She controls my life- from my career choice, school choice, dorm life (I hate living in a dorm), friends (she gets to choose who I hang out with. Every single day she screams at me foe making the stupidest mistakes, napakaperfectionist, it's like walking in eggshells. However my brother and sister get to live the life they want.

I once read on my book, "" The moment a parent scream at your adult children, is the moment they lose respect to you.""

Why is my mom so kind to my brother, but always scream at me? If I was born as a son, will my mom respect me too.

She is the worst humab being I've ever met, basically a Filipina karen, tsismosa, judgemental, hurts animals, looks down on service crew or informal settlers (I always defend them saying they're just humans trying to survive and she literally tried to indoctrinate me to have a mindset like hers.. it's disgusting)

I realized, my mom hates me, because I can never be as cruel as her, infact the exact opposite.

My mom became the person I never wanted to be.

I wanted to leave so bad.
And if the abuse continues, I might even end things in front of her, so she'll live with the regret of her hurting her child.

I'm so fucking tired.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/17o54ii/verbally_abusive_mom_my_first_bully/,t2_n4alawv8q,2023-11-05 13:24:40,1

Abusive manipulative parents,"Advice pls. I am currently 21 (F) and in my last year of University.
Especially with my mum the past few years since I started university became really hard. Throughout my childhood she has forced me into islamic practices, going to the mosque and memorizing quran even when I got older. But after some years I realized I do not believe in it and she would be psychologically and sometimes physically also abuse me if I didn't obey to her rules. I got the chance to study abroad with a partial scholarship but I am mostly dependent on my parents financially as they pay my rent and support me. The first year of my uni year she would call me 3-4 times a day and at night to control me and see where I am and what I do. But towards the end of that year I met someone and we started dating. Since the beginning I had to keep my relationship a secret because they wouldn't approve of me dating at all especially someone out of my culture and non muslim. But those are not important to me because I want to live my own life. She kept bothering me with the questions and try to control me. Then once she came to visit me and went through my phone finding out I have a bf. At first she didn't take it serious but with the time she got more aggressive over it and started to threaten me. They tried to pressure me to talk to someone's son they know and to arrange a marriage, and it was really hard for me to push through even when I told them I am seeing someone they threatened to cut me off and out of their life so I lied to them. Now I am almost done with University but I want to pursue a Masters. She once again threatens me and called me all kinds of stuff like that I am impure, worthless, not worthy to be her daughter, a shame on her, dirtying her reputation and make her burn in hell. On top of that she hit me multiple times because I refused to change my life in the way she wants to and didn't comply to her „rules"". Now she is threading to tell everything to my father which is her way of emotionally manipulating me since I care a lot about him. And that they will stop communicating with me If I „keep continue living a sinful non married life and have a relationship"" and that she will make my life a living hell. I am sick of living with this and just losing my hope everyday.

Verbally Abusive Dementia Patient,"Ayun nga may dementia ang lola ko. We've been taking care of her for almost a year now and recently nag fully start yung dementia niya. Mabait lola ko, sweet and caring siya kahit nung may sakit na siya. Pero nung nagstart yung dementia niya naging verbally abusive na siya. Lagi kami sinisigawan, sinasabi niya di enough ginagawa namin, binabato niya lahat ng ginawa niya samin just to say andami naming pagkukulang. Minsan di lang regular insults may pag mumura pa minsan. Wala daw kami kwenta lol.

And of course I understand na it's not her fault and she's sick. Pero ang sakit? nakakapagod? It's non-stop din kasi. Unless she's asleep inaaway niya kami. Naaawa ako sa dad ko kasi siya pinaka inaaway ni lola. Wala ako magawa, wala kami magawa. Syempre I'm not allowed to complain, and I don't. At least not out loud lol.

Why do I feel closer with my abusers,"I was sexually harassed for 2-3 years (memory’s blurry) by my cousin. Ginagawa niya pag tulog ako. Nagsimula noong grade 7 palang ako, grad na ko ng college ngayon haha. He would touch my private parts and I’d feel him fapping beside me. Sometimes I’d feel his semen na tumalsik sa akin.

Akala ko nung una panaginip lang. Close kami eh. Kinupkop namin siya noong nag-aral siya sa Maynila. Mabait naman siya sa umaga. Kabonding ko sa mga banda at arts. Pero totoo pala. Hindi ko naman alam mararamdaman ko. 

Pero noong unang taon, sinabi ko sa kuya ko. Unang beses kong umiyak. Unang beses kong nagsumbong. Kaso wala siyang ginawa, hindi nga nagreact. Kinabukasan parang wala lang. Nakikipagbiruan lang ulit kami sa kanya.

Hindi lang isang beses akong nagsabi sa iba. Hindi ko kaya mag-isa eh. Di ko kayang magsabi. Sa tita ko, ate ko, pinsan ko, pati mga kaklase ko (oo, MGA), wala namang nangyari. 

Tinanggap ko na lang. Di ko na rin naman alam iisipin o gagawin. Dumating sa point na ayaw ko na lang na malaman niyang gising ako. Ang daming problema sa bahay, ayoko dumagdag. I was always a timid kid na takot magsalita, kahit sa ganong moment, hindi na lang ako makagalaw. Pinipikit ko na lang nang mariin mata ko. 

Isa pa, hinahawakan niya lang naman ako kako. Baka hindi grounds ito para sa reaksyon ko. Baka OA lang ako. Ang daming mas malala dyan eh, sa akin yun lang.

Hanggang sa umabot ng taon. Natigil na lang nung umuwi siya sa province nung 4th year na ko.

Ako ayun, sobrang depressed. Traumatized at sinisisi ang sarili kasi hindi ako nagsalita. Traumatized at hindi na kayang himingi ng tulong sa iba. Galit sa sarili kasi paano ako nakakatwa ksama yung hayop na yon? Galit sa sarili kasi kasalanan ko rin.

Ngayong medyo naghiheal na ako sa particular trauma na to, narirealize ko na ang tanga ko nga. Hindi na dapat ako humingi ng tulong o naghintay sagipin ng iba. Sana yung tapang ko ngayon meron ako kahit katiting noon.

Weird lang din. Pakiramdam ko andito yung trauma pero madalas wala na. Di ko naman siya pinatawad pero pakiramdam ko nakakalimot na ko. Bat ang bait ko pa rin don at bakit komportable akong makipagbiruan sa kanya? Ang weird. Pakiramdam ko hinihiwalay ko siya doon sa ginawa niya. Di niya naman deserve. Tangina ng mga manyak ha.

Note: hindi lang siya. Pati mga kapatid niya. Siya lang malala. Di ko alam kung sabwatan tong mga to kasi pare-parehas sila ng ginawa. Pero ang pamilya namin pinaka-close sa kanila putangina.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/ztqxvt/why_do_i_feel_closer_with_my_abusers/,t2_8hfeea1h,2022-12-24 03:50:59,59

I was sexually assaulted and psychologically abused,"This happened three years ago. My(22F) ex(22M) was generally nice to everyone, he was a gentleman and was protective of me but I realized that it was only when he gets what he wants. One time he forcefully penetrated me even when I begged him multiple times not to and also told him to stop because it physically hurts. He got annoyed at me and told me pa-victim daw ako. He then tried to haggle and compromise by saying hell waiting for me to say no three times before he'd stop. I kept telling him no means no. But whenever I say no, he would give me the silent treatment or throw stuff around until I complied. After that, he'd act nice again.  He also kept secretly removing the condom in the middle of sex whenever I tell him that I'll only do it if we had contraception. He also kept bragging to his friends that he and I were having sex, even if I told him I wasn't okay with people knowing about it. Whenever I tried to leave the relationship, he'd threaten to jump off his condo. He'd send me pictures of his leg situated on top of the railings, he would threaten me that he'll spread intimate pictures he took of me in secret, he'd throw tantrums in public by yelling, hurting himself, or walking out. Back when we were friends, I opened up about losing a childhood friend to suicide and I feel like he scared me on purpose to prevent our break up.  I finally had the guts to break up with him after being pushed to my breaking point and because I moved to the province and am now super far from him plus he doesn't know my new address. I still get flashbacks of these events in the middle of doing chores, in the middle of online class or when I'm studying and its really fucking me up. I try to stay strong especially for my current boyfriend (23M), he's helped me work through this and listened to me speak about it a lot of times but I can tell that its making him sad hearing what I went through, he isn't supposed to be a therapist after all. My boyfriend says I was violated and couldn't have consented but its still hard for me to consider this. I  wanted to tell my parents but I know they would end up blaming me instead for being too stupid.  I know I didn't consent to most of it but I did let myself suffer in silence. Sometimes I feel like I deserve this because I wasn't careful enough in choosing a partner. I still struggle with the idea that I had no control over the situation when I know I could've left had I been smarter and been stronger mentally. It still makes me feel suicidal after all these years. I still feel unclean. I feel like a burden to those who I love that know what I went through because I keep crying about it and remembering it. I want to get therapy but I don't want my parents to find out, but I also don't want someone to hear it while knowing who I am. Its something I'm really ashamed about.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/ti4wdg/i_was_sexually_assaulted_and_psychologically/,t2_5wlcfxxu,2022-03-20 05:07:10,4
dealing with an abusive brother and a dismissive adult family,"just a throwaway account. i've just been frustrated to no end.

i have a brother above a decade older than me who grew up with an abusive father. because of this he ended up growing with immense trauma and anger issues. i'm his younger half sibling from another father.

when i was younger i always knew he had issues, but back then it was mostly just being unable to control when he yells etc etc. usually my mom would tell him to calm down and that used to be enough. pero when he grew older he started becoming straight up abusive, not just to his gf and stepkids, but also to some other people he'd live with, like their live in yaya.

i've been lucky enough not to be the target of his physical and emotional abuse, mainly protected by my mom. (he told me tho i was lucky he never hit me. thaaaanks.)

anyway, he doesn't live with us but often comes back home for family stuff like new years etc. it's usually then where i'd just see him fight with his gf and straight up hit her at times. i remember when i was a kid he held a fork up to her face right in front of me while they fought.

what's most frustrating about this whole situation tbh is how the adults in my family handle it. us kids (me, mga pinsan ko) know what he's doing is very, very wrong, but we're very young compared to him and most of us are just starting college and have no financial or even personal freedom to start butting in. the adults like my mom, my titas, etc just think he has a ""personality."" for my titas case it's mainly bc di nila nakikita ung other side nya, kasi usually medj friendly and talkative sya pag masaya o kalmado.

i've dealt with this for years and even if i wasn't a victim myself, ofc i felt horrible knowing his gf and kids have to deal with him everyday. his gf is used to it even if she hates it kasi she believes it's normal since her parents had a similar relationship. i'm worried about their children perpetuating the cycle.

i got super fed up with it today and recorded one of their altercations so i'd just have some evidence, or at least proof to vent when people don't want to listen. he saw me recording and threatened me too. nothing came of it thankfully, but i was so frustrated that i was unable to do anything for my SIL who was crying and my nephew who was probably watching or listening in the other room.

i was already feeling terrible but what made it even worse was when i sent the video to my mom. she asked me a few things about what happened kasi di masyadong clear ung angle ng video, and after that i told her that i told some other relatives, which she got mad about. sinabi nya that i was tearing my brother's image and asked kung naghahanap lang ako ng away. she said that others would just be annoyed that i kept whistleblowing about personal family business.

i felt so disillusioned with my mom at that moment. is your image more important than the people he's hurting? nakakaiyak. i cried alone in my room later. why was i the only one getting mad at this type of situation? i know it's sort of part of the culture here, pero it doesn't mean it's right. 

i'm also scared to take action now as a dependent of my mom bc if anything fails and he finds out i was 
responsible, i might also be targetted. it's so frustrating. i wish things could change. i hope i can change it when i'm older. i want my pamangkins to grow up without this trauma.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/18pcfm0/dealing_with_an_abusive_brother_and_a_dismissive/,t2_cx24283q,2023-12-24 03:00:24,1
TW: Gore/Animal Abuse,"It's been a while and I had to simmer myself down, significantly, before I had to post this. If I did so, immediately, I would've generalized a race to its core. But, news and videos have been spreading across social media like wildfire about a cat getting blended, pretty much alive. As someone who lost quite a few cats in the past due to natural causes, and some with human intervention, I CAN'T STRESS ENOUGH HOW MUCH I WANT TO TORTURE THE PERPETRATOR TO INSANITY. Why is it that when some fucked up shit involving animals comes out, it's almost always some random person from China that's involved? We have Yulin, which an argument could be made that it's a cultural thing. Then there's bats, and then there's rats being eaten. Now, we have cats getting punished for seemingly no reason. I've read that there are no animal abuse laws in some, if not most, parts of China so there's not much the government can do. I don't fucking get it. If there's no animal abuse laws, then aren't humans fair game? Just this one time, imma introduce that guy to scaphism and death by the brazen bull. 😊

I hope animal abusers, everywhere around the world, gets their fingers pulled out one by one by lions. Their torsos be kicked and gored open by kangaroos, their backs be rammed by bisons, their limbs be life rolled by crocs, and their insides be picked out by vultures. Y'all are the lowest scum and I hope to never snap and come across one. I'm sure I'd enjoy the melody of the brazen bull if I do.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/13esuqh/tw_goreanimal_abuse/,t2_bs1qlwqk,2023-05-12 00:51:29,7
TW : abuse,"Single mom ako, mag 1 yr old yung baby ko. Ako naman 20 yrs old. Yung ex partner ko 26. Nakipag hiwalay ako recently kasi everytime na mag aaway kami lagi akong pinagbubuhatan ng kamay. Kesyo sampal or suntok. May instances pa na ginagalaw nya ako habang tulog. Di ako nagigising kaagad kasi sobrang pagod ako. Magigising na lang ako wala na akong pang ibaba.
Lagi din nya akong sinasaktan kapag pinagsasabihan o kaya o kaya pinakikisuyuan. Puro lang phone and games ang inaatupag nya. Tamad din sya mag trabaho and umaasa sa parents nya. 

Gusto nyang makita yung anak namin. Papayag ba ako? Magmula nung naghiwalay kami ang pinadala nya lang na sustento ay 1,450. Last month pa sya huling nagbigay.

Met my abuser once again,"My family and I went away last Friday to visit the wake of my cousin and there, I met my other cousin who was my abuser (let’s call him K). Habang papunta kami nun at nasa sasakyan, my dad said that K will also be there. Hindi ako makagalaw. Hindi ako makahinga at pawis na pawis ako. I had to keep my composure dahil di ko kayang malaman nila. At one point sa biyahe, tinatawag-tawag ako ng kapatid ko dahil may ipapatingin siya sakin sa phone niya at di niya magawa kasi nagmamaneho siya, wala akong marinig nun kaya siniko niya ako kasi di raw ako kumikibo. Hindi talaga ako makagalaw sa biyahe. Init na init din ako. Kating-kati na ako sabihin sa fam yung totoo pero natatakot pa rin ako for some reason. That K molested my at 10 years old when I was in Grade 5, sampung taon na ang nakakalipas. Ang alam lang kasi nila e yung ninakawan ako ni K ng phone. Yun lang kasi yung sinabi ko noon dahil takot nga akong umamin. Pinipigalan kong maluha sahil baka mahalata nilang may problema. Gusto kong sumigaw pero parang may nakabusal sa bibig ko. Gusto kong magdabog. Gusto kong manakit. 

Ang daming tumatakbo sa isip ko. Siguro hindi na mahalagang malaman ng iba yung nangyari kasi may part sa akin na ginusto yon. Siguro sinisisi ko rin yung sarili ko dahil I let it happen then? O siguro nakondisyon lang ako na gustuhin yon. Siguro din ay doon ko maibabaling yung sisi sa hypersexuality ko. Siguro deserve ko rin naman yon. Hindi ko na rin alam, gulong-gulo na ako. Gusto ko na sanang bumaba ng sasakyan at umuwi mag-isa, bahala na silang tatlo pumunta, kahit maglakad pa ako pauwi basta makaalis lang. 

Fast forward sa lamay, kabadong-kabado ako. Andun na nga siya. Pakiramdam ko kailangan kong maging nice towards him. Parang mali. Basta we greeted each other, we shook hands and tapped each other’s shoulders. Nag-inom pa kami. Hindi ko rin alam paano ko nagawang maging civil towards him. Siguro dahil matagal ko na siyang napatawad at matagal ko nang natanggap yung nangyari? Idk. O baka hindi ko pa siya napapatawad at feeling ko ay naoobliga pa rin akong patunguhan siya nang maayos? Idk. Ewan, wala na akong alam tanginamo. Isa kang malaking surot sa mundong to hayop ka. Maaksidente ka sana habang nagmomotor.

Why was I tolerating an abusive relationship,"Me M(20) and my GF(19) have been together for almost 3 years.

 I've always noticed na palagi niyang pinipilit ang gusto niya tapos kapag hindi niya nakakamit ay siya ay magagalit ng sobra na parang ewan ko ba, alam mo yung mga bagay na pwede naman pag usapan idadala niya palagi sa ganon. Minsan pati sa public pag ganon sitwasyon hahampasin niya ako sa tapat ng maraming tao at sinisigawan dahil nataasan ko daw siya ng boses, e nasa mall kasi kami non as in wala akong marinig pati ako di ako aware sa volume ko, inexplain ko naman sakanya at inexplain ko din kapag kumalma siya. Kahit nag ka ayusan na kami ako parin sinisisi na nakakahiya ako sa public kahit alam ko na wala akong maling nagawa.

Kapag sa side ko naman pag may gusto ako tas di ko nakakamit minsan binabrush off lang niya or nilalaugh off, pero pag nag address ako ng issue magagalit siya na parang hanggang bukas ang haba, pag gusto makipag usap ng matino or makipag ayos palagi niyang dinadaan sa away.

I WAS VERBALLY ABUSED YESTERDAY,"Nagstart ako last month maging SW because I have to provide everything for my family and be a better person, I have a full time job pero hindi sapat and was burned out with everything. But this client abused me verbally, I will not elaborate more and mention any personal details about him.

I WILL NEVER EVER STEAL ANY MONEY OR ANY CENT FROM OTHER PEOPLE. Please know that I won’t ever scam and I will never do it for christ sake. Call me POKPOK whenever you want but everyone knows how pure my intention is, never kong tinapakan or tatapakan na kahit sino. Alam yan ng mga tao sa paligid ko at alter friends ko.

To my co-SWs and para na rin sa lahat, kung mababasa niyo to, ALWAYS trust your GUT and INSTINCTS. Wag niyong iignore yung red flags. Never ever let your clients or anyone abuse you emotionally, mentally and physically. I hope you’re all safe.

It's been a year since my abuser left me.,"I'm very glad to have survived that phase in my life. Di na ako umuuwing may bruise, di na ako nagq-question kung dapat ba akong i-grope ng public ng ka-date ko, di na ako napipilitan na mag-send ng intimate photos just for a guy to reply fast, di na ako sinasabihan ng OA at praning kapag nagt-try ako mag-confront once in a while. 

&#x200B;

It lasted for 9 months. The initial 3 months were pure bliss, then it became 6 months of hell after. 1 year na since he ghosted me when I finally told him how much it bothers me that he likes to ignore me   a lot and make me feel used after physically harassing me. Takot na takot na ako. I used to be that confident bubbly girl na anytime kaya mag-confess sa guy na gusto nya (Sya din ang nauna umamin na he wanted to build a serious relationship with me) Pero ngayon di ko na kaya gawin hahaha, it even led to a point na nagka-situationship ako dahil takot na ako to confront people. Umuusbong na rin ang galit ko sa mga taong ang lakas gamitin ang mental health card kahit di naman sila clinically diagnosed dahil napakadalas nyang gamiting excuse yon for him to justify his causes. Sa ngayon nags-sorry pa rin sya at guilty, nagre-request pa na mag-upload ako ng picture ng aso namin para makita nya. Kapal lang ng mukha.

MY ABUSIVE EX BOYFRIEND IS RUNNING FOR SK.,"trigger warning // mentions sexual harassment, rape and abusive relationship

I’m going to post this here kasi sobrang sama talaga ng loob ko ever since I (21F) saw several posters of my ex (22M) plastered all over our barangay and found out that he really was running for SK thru a friend of mine. Naiinis ako because hindi niya deserve. Hindi niya deserve maging SK Kagawad. Hindi niya deserve ang suporta na binibigay sa kanya ngayon ng mga taga-rito samin.

Every time that I see his stupid fucking face, nagagalit ako at naaalala ko kung paano niya ako trinato nung kami pa. From bullying me, physically, verbally and emotionally abusing me, and on top of that, sexually harassing and raping me, hindi niya talaga deserve maging SK Kagawad. Every time that I see his poster na naka-ngiti, I want to rip that poster and burn it. Worst of all, dahil maliit lang ang mundo, I see my facebook friends sharing the posts he uploaded while doing community service na ang caption ay “si (ex) ang SK ko! baka SK ko yan! serbisyong mabait at tapat!” and I can’t help but roll my eyes, dahil hindi naman totoo na mabait siya; and those same people are the ones na nag-push sa ex ko to sexually harass me for him to “be a real man and let go of celibacy”.

Your SK Kagawad fucking abused me throughout our 5-year relationship and here I am, two years later, still healing from the trauma he fucking left. Ang hirap lang, tangina. One minute I tell myself that I’m fine, the second I’m mad and crying dahil naalala ko lahat ng ginawa niya. Ang hirap lang kasi I remember speaking up about what he did to me, yet I ended up becoming the bad person dahil “mabait” at catechist siya sa simbahan – mas maraming naniniwala sa kanya, kesa sakin at hinding-hindi niya kayang gawin ang mga sinabi ko dahil anak siya ng Diyos, lol. Your SK Kagawad made me feel small, pakiramdam ko napaka-dumi kong tao sa mga pinaggagawa niya sakin throughout the whole duration of our relationship. Tangina, yang SK Kagawad niyo magaling mag-baliktad ng storya!

Your SK kagawad is a liar, abusive and rapist. He’s a fucking bastard, he doesn’t deserve that position. Kung siya ang future ng city na to o ng barangay na to, tangina.

my abusive family wants me to be their financial savior,"so, mag-umpisa tayo when i was 7 years old my mom and dad broke up and at that point dun ko na naranasan lahat ng klase ng abuse from my relatives, hindi nila ko kaya saktan when papa was here bc my papa is a known warfreak on his younger days and lagi din niyang sinasabi na “walang ibang pwedeng dumisiplina sayo kundi ako lang at mama mo”
and after lumayas ni papa dun na nila ako sinimulang palakihin na parang preso required sumunod sa mga toxic family culture 
at kung hindi ako susunod ay may bugbog or masakit na salita akong maririnig kaya naisipan ko mag-rebelde sa kanila obviously di nila yun nagustuhan pero dumating na kasi ako sa point na satisfaction ko na ang disappointment nila, nagsimula ako sa mga simpleng away kalye na umaabot ng police station at mga reklamo sa brgy hanggang sa natuto akong mag yosi’t alak at this point wala na silang inaasahang bright future sa pagkatao ko kaya naman tinawag nila akong black sheep ng pamilya at hinahalintulad ako sa papa ko pero hindi na yun importante sakin at nung sinabi ko sa kanila na magta-trabaho na ako tinanong ako ng tito ng mama ko na “may inaasahan ba kami di'yan? kasi kung hindi mag-aral ka nalang sayang lang mga pinalamon namin sayo” like mama at tita ko lang ang nag-alaga sakin pero feel nila may utang na loob din ako sa kanila kaya naman sinabihan ko siya na “mahiya ka nakapag-tapos ka ng pag-aaral pero di mo nagawa yumaman tapos ngayon gusto mo akuin ko responsibilidad mo sa nanay mo?” sumagot naman siya ng “wala ba akong anak na nag-aaral sa private?” at sinagot ko naman siya ng “kasalanan ko ba yun?” after ng pagtatalo namin nagbago bigla yung pakikitungo sakin ng pamilya ko hanggang sa sinabi ko na ng diretso sa kanila na wala akong balak na magtrabaho para sa kanila at para lang yun sa sarili ko hindi na sila sumagot after ko sabihin yun at ngayon same na kami ng nararanasan ng pinsan ko pero mas matindi yung kanya dahil nakatira siya puder ng mga tito ng mama ko, sinabihan ko siya na matuto siyang labanan ang peste naming pamilya at magiging ayos siya once napatahimik niya ang mga yun, ngayon nagbabalak akong huminto ng pag-aaral kahit na malapit na ako grumaduate ng highschool may plano kami ng mga kaibigan ko na lumipat ng ibang bahay kung saan hindi kami masusundan at magugulo ng mga pamilya namin dahil same type of family meron kami ng mga tropa ko

My grandparents are financially abusing my mom,"Background: Mom is a typical OFW with a big family who met and married a foreign guy (my dad). She said na since she was 16, she has been working odd jobs here and there in the PH to help my grandparents raise her siblings (she's the first out of five). My grandfather was a jeepney driver and my grandmother was a housewife. 

When she was 18, she found an opportunity to work abroad and that's where she met my dad. 5 years later, they got married, had me, and shipped me off to the PH. It was not clear to me why they made me live with my lola and lolo, but later on, I realized na baka it was difficult for my mom to take care of me kasi she was working full-time to send money back home. 

My grandparents stopped working when she started working abroad and made my mom the breadwinner of the fam.

She sent all of my titos and titas to school while she never fulfilled her dreams to be a doctor. They wasted the opportunity on booze and drugs. Only 1 of them finished her schooling. 

Now that my mom is in her 50s, she's still sending my grandparents money for living expenses. 2 of my titos and titas are now abroad and 2 of them stayed in the PH. The ones abroad all give money to my lolo and lola but I don't understand why my mom still has to give them when she has sacrificed a lot for them.

I see my mom growing old and I feel resentment towards my grandparents for making her the breadwinner. I hate that they made children they cannot afford to raise. 

I hate them for making her send us to the PH because she can't afford to take care of us kasi she had to support all of their lazy asses. 

I hate that they're also trying to extort money from me kasi I'm also living abroad.

Weaponized Incompetence is a Manipulative and Abusive Tactic,"Ayoko sa mga tao na ginamit na ang icompetence as an excuse. The worst.. they are not even incompetent. They put themselves out there as one to avoid doing any tasks and work.

"I was sexually abused, not once. not twice. But as I grew up.","Nangyari to when I was in elementary, 2nd grade as I recall. The eldest boy among my classmates used to touch me in my legs and thighs in a very disturbing manner. back then I thought na kinikiliti lang ako, kasi that's what my innocent mind knows. But he repeated it almost everyday until I feel uncomfortable, but at the same time I was convinced na it was harmless and he can do it anytime he wants and he even did it to different girls in our class. Until one day one of us stood up and nagsumbong sa class adviser namin. I remember my self shocked and scared kasi he did it to me everyday for a very long time and I didn't have any idea that it was wrong. I started crying as our teacher asked each one of us kung sino pa yung ginagawan niya ng ganon, I remember the feeling of shame at that age kasi we were asked sa harap ng buong class I still remember yung mga tingin. We are in a private catholic school, where nuns run the school. I remember my teacher asking 6 of us girls who he touched. The set up is 6 of us girls — our teacher — the young offender — and one of the sisters in our school. There's no Parents present in that conversation. We we're asked sa harap din mismo ng offender namin, we we're overwhelmed by the situation, we were just kids na dapat naglalaro lang at nag aaral.  I remember na since then I can't look at that boy the same anymore, the conversation ends with an apology. Just a piece of apology. whole elementary days ko naging ilag ako sa lalaking yun and being in a small, private catholic school means you'll having the same class with your classmates for years.  I thought our parents are already notified about the incident and it's already taken care of kasi no one talks about it anymore, but no. I remember myself na umiiwas sa mga lalaki. As the years goes by I forced myself to forget how horrible it feels like. but I think that incident wake something in me. Something I can't control as I grew up. Until recently I remembered the same exact feeling. I wasn't good for days and madalas tulala lang ako. I decided to tell my mother about it, she cried as if she failed to protect me. She know nothing about it, the school tried their best to hide it well. She know nothing how hard is it for me that time and she feels bad about it.

Growing up, maaga nagmature body ko, I was scared sa mga changes. I saw my breast perked up. My hips get wider and my waist are getting curvier. I always looked 2-4 years older than my age. I remember a lot of time na nacacatcall ako kahit nasa early years palang ako ng Junior Highschool years ko. It's very disturbing. I was always afraid of guys looking my legs, and back of my thighs everytime I walked pass through them. That's why everytime I go out, my clothes are always have sleeves or bigger sizes, or long sleeves and hoodies, my pants will always be long and shorts will be always just above the knees. But then again, I was abused.

I was raped when I was 15. It's my first. He's my first boyfriend and he's 19 that time. I thought it was love but as I think of it now, it was full manipulation. I was emotionally unstable when we met kasi my father just passed away that time and I felt unsafe, abandoned and alone. He preyed on me. I was young and given a huge responsibility on my shoulder. I can't bear with it. I needed some support and someone who can help me to get through it. The first month is pure and sweet but one day I got out of school early so sa kanila ako dumiretso. Pag punta ko, nag iinuman pala silang magpipinsan, puro lalaki, kasama mga kapatid niya, I had few drinks until I feel tipsy. He tricked me and he hold on tight sa waist ko and he said sa mga pinsan niya ""akyat daw siya nahihilo siya eh"" I never said anything I even tried to say na ayos lang ako pero hinigpitan niya lalo yung kapit niya sa bewang ko, kaya sumama ako. I was intoxicated when he did it, I repeatedly say no pero mas malakas siya sakin. wala akong nagawa. It was my first and It happened that way. I know what actually happened kaya I asked him ""mahal mo naman ako diba?"" as if I was asking for assurance na he won't leave me. but he never answered, and I go home all by myself with the thought na baka mabuntis ako at panliliit sa sarili ko kasi hindi ko nakuha yung sagot na gusto kong marinig habang siya nakuha yung virginity ko sa ganong paraan. the very next day he blocked me and left me as if para akong gamit. I still remember one of his cousins na binastos pa ako after what happened, hindi niya lang ako nirape, niyabang niya pa sa buong angkan niya na nakuha niya ako. No one understood the pain and no one knows that it happened. I dealt it on my own. 

I kept it for a year and a half but my life begins to be bumpy and I was alcoholic and uncontrollable. it even gets to the point that my own younger brother beat me up when we fight (verbally) coz he thought I don't have any authority, he doesn't even respect me, he'll punch me in the head, stomach and inuuntog niya ako sa pader at hagdan, this continued until I had my second relationship He's 23 and I'm 16. I never felt safe for a long time until he arrived in my life but then saglit lang kasi he's cheating behind my back for 4 times, I'll forgive him and he's back at it again and again. He's the worst one. He used me for his own good. We had sex. A lot. I mean a lot, and he always refuse to wear condoms and having the thought na he cheated on me makes me sick of myself and hate myself more. Akala ko I found someone na poprotekta sakin, akala ko na finally may  masasandalan na ako but he end up confessing that he's only using me for his financial needs. at sa huli mag isa nanaman ako di ko alam saan ko nanaman pupulutin sarili ko.

I've been single for a year again and here comes the last relationship I had. I'm 17 and he's 21. He knows these things about me kasi I've been brave to share it with him and trust my life to him but cheating was never new to him also. I still remember an Intimate moment when I beg like ""if ayaw mo na sakin, sabihin mo nalang. Kasi pag naghiwalay tayo ayaw kong matandaan na niloko mo pa ako kasi mahal na mahal kita"". A month after that he cheated on me for the first time.  And the second time was so much painful na up to this day nahirapan na ako magtiwala. We broke up and at the very next day, his ex and him are together. 

It was so devastating to look back into these past relationships I had and abuses that I dealt on my own. I am just finding someone I can trust, someone who can be my family, and someone I can be with until the end. I never share this para kaawaan ako or to beg love and empathy from everyone, I share this to remind all of you how to be gentle and how to be kind to everyone. How to be strong and how to keep on going. Only God knows how hard it is. How it feels like a trash being thrown around after every use. 

As I turn 19, and to the next years I'm having, these things got me reminded that I will no longer find any man to fill every void na mas lalo lang lumalaki everytime I believe. I hope for the better days. And I hope to learn how I forgive and forget this things.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/w27jmh/i_was_sexually_abused_not_once_not_twice_but_as_i/,t2_q6lfuwl0,2022-07-19 03:13:13,56
I think my hypersexuality is a response to abuse,"Being sexually abused multiple times when I was young caused my hyper-sexuality. I always wondered how my life would be different if it never occurred. Now I’m struggling to find real connections. I have little to no self confidence, to gain validation I have to sexualized myself. I’m finding it very difficult to learn how to love myself. 

I rarely talk about this, no one irl knows na ganito ako.

My mom thinks everyone is against her even tho she abused me my whole life,"This is my first post on here so let me start by saying that I (f 17) have a younger sister (f14), my mom (f 43) and dad (m 46). Even since i was very young i was expected to know things and mistakes waren’t allowed. From grade 1-5 so i was like 6-10 at the time my mom would be very set on me and grades. She would often hit me and was and still is extremely verbally abusive, like there isnt a day where she doesnt yell, curse or call me names. I would start crying at school when i would make too many mistakes on a paper cuz “ my mom would get mad”. When i got in grade 5-7 i had to learn every day every single lesson I had in school, my mom would test me after and she would get very aggressive if i forgot something. During the time i got in 8th grade my sister was in school already and, how do i say, my sister is the favorite child and its very obvious, she was never expected the things i was, she never had to learn or she was never tested by my mom like that. My mom never laid a finger on her. Oh i also forgot to mention that because of the stress i was in and all the expectations i started sh from a pretty young age. As i started highschool i got caught being on my phone at night and my parents took my phone and looked through it. I got punished and since then I’m not allowed to have my phone past 10 pm. I started sneaking old phones n got caught multiple times. Because of the way i was isolated from friend and just a social life due to my parents almost never letting me hang out with friends i used online games and friends as a coping mechanism. My mom did not like that and as i  grew older i missed out on so much, teenage stuff cuz of her. I am very sensible now, i cant fight without cryng , i have often panic attacks and just overall i don’t know what to do.
Last night she caught me with a vape and had a whole break down over the fact that everyone is her enemy in this house and that strangers are nicer to her (she s a whole different person around strangers). I’m almost 18 and expected from her to act like I’m 18 when i still have a curfew and being treated like a kid. 
There is so much more and i could speak on this for hours but it’s enough rn. Idk what to do",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/zsx6g7/my_mom_thinks_everyone_is_against_her_even_tho/,t2_v5ca9eqg,2022-12-23 05:20:11,2
so tired of the emotional abuse at home,"My mom and I haven’t talked since Tuesday. She has been giving the silent treatment because I put my hands to face like [this](https://www.dreamstime.com/stock-image-man-put-his-hands-face-image24096821) and she thinks it’s because of her. 

Pero nung araw na yun, I had a big presentation for my supervisor, I had b2b client meetings, my psychiatrist cancelled the day before, and I had an upcoming talk which I hadn’t prepared for. 

She asked me “ano ba problema mo?” in an angry tone and I told her it was because of stress. She reacted angrily kasi akala niya it was because of her. How am I supposed to open up if she doesn’t listen and galit agad kapag magreact? Now she hasn’t talked to me in 5 days.

I honestly am not affected by the silence and ignorance. It’s more of the emotional abuse from a narcissistic parent na matagal ko nang tinitiis since I entered school. It’s tiring and I want to move out. I live with a nmom and an enabler, cheating dad. You can check my profile, I have a lot of stories there.

My abusive mom is dying and she is still being a prick,"My mom has been diagnosed with emphysema recently. This morning, she had difficulty breathing and was taken to the hospital for a check-up. She complained na wala akong ambag since my younger sister, who just recently got a job after being semi-jobless for almost a decade, shelled out 13k.

I am a bit in debt and pawned some stuff just to get the body of her dog cremated properly. Also, almost all of my money goes to her requests and even for her yosi. So honestly, the nerve of her to complain eh inuunos nga niya pera ko sa bisyo niya dati.

She abused me when I was a child leading to many mental issues I have till now which prevent me from being successful at anything, since I have PTSD and meltdowns.

Originally eh pinlano ko to spend most of what I earn from her to give her a nice experience sa remaining years of her life like good food, vacation (never pa siya nakalabas ng Luzon), designer stuff, concert (never pa siya nakanood), etc.

Kaso, nakakawalang-gana. Tumanda na akong walang patutunguhan dahil sa kanya tapos ganito.

"Nakalaya na din sa abusive, suicidal, and narcissistic ex. What's next for me?","After living in with this guy for 3 years, we finally broke up. Actually yung reason ay more on fault ko (no 3rd party) pero deep inside ang saya saya ko because I was able to finally get out of this hell hole.

We both have mental issues and laging nag-aaway dahil hindi kami compatible on most things.

Bakit di kayo maghiwalay? Ang sagot ko diyan ay familiar ba kayo sa cases ng sobrang attachment ng inaabuse dun sa abuser? Ganun yon.

Puro na lang breakdowns niya nireresolve ko pucha pano naman ako? Napaka gaslighter ng lalakin yun grabe lahat nalang mali ko, never nya inaacknowledge na may pagkakamali siya.

Imbes na makipag-argue in a civil way ang hilig  magwala at magbato ng mga gamit rinig na rinig ng mga kapitbahay lintek.

Double income with no kids? MALI. Double income  slash yaya kamo ang peg ko sa bahay.

Kahit ikwento niya pa sa sambayanan na gastadora ako at walang naiipon sa malaking sahod ko (napupunta sa family kong 999% toxic din) kaya nya ko hiniwalayan kanina okay lang peace of mind naman ang kapalit nito.

Next week pagkasahod ko lilipat na ko, actually naghahanap nako sa FB ng lilipatan pero wala akong idea kung san ako lilipat dahil konti lang talaga friends ko. Baka may suggestions kayo na safe area.

After 3 years, malaya na ko. Tapos na ko maging yaya sa lalaking wala naman akong balak pakasalan.

(TW: SA) My abuser wants to help my family financially,"I was sexually abused for years when I was a child -- by my own cousin. It started when I was 7. He was 18 at that time. It kept going for years. It only stopped when I got my period. I never told my parents about it because he told me my parents would disown me because I was a disgrace. Stupid, stupid child. I ended up telling my mother about it when I was 21. I’m in my late 20s now. She blamed herself for being clueless about it and letting it happen. I never blamed her for anything.

Fast forward to last year. We lost my father to cancer. We used all our savings for his treatments, their retirement funds, my tuition funds, my sister’s savings from work. Our house and lot title is still in the hospital as collateral for our remaining balance. It’s been a year and we’re still paying accumulated debts.

I was planning to file a leave of absence because my family obviously can’t afford to send me to med school anymore. But my mother told me to not to stop because “malapit ka naman na matapos, anak. Kaya natin gawan ng paraan.” She was struggling. We were struggling. But I kept going like how she wanted, how my father wanted.

Last week, my cousin, yes, the same cousin, left my mother a message. Asking how she’s holding up, how my studies are going. He doesn’t know that my mother knows about us. My mother acted civil around him because I told her not to make a big deal out of it. I wouldn’t want to cause trouble. I told her to promise me not to act out on her feelings. Stupid, stupid child.

They exchanged messages over the week. And yesterday, he told my mother he wants to pay my tuition fees. I’ve been giving the school promissory notes the whole semester. He said he’s willing to pay for it. Also for the next semester, in advance. And he’s also planning to give my mother a certain amount to help pay our other debts.

I just got off the phone with my mother. She cried after apologizing because she considered to accept his offer; how it would’ve been a burden off our shoulders, but it would hurt me in return.

I feel numb. I want to lash out. But I can’t feel anything. My cousin also sent me a message… asking for my bank details. I want to swallow the bit of pride I have left in me, set aside all the messed up things this asshole did to me, and just accept his help. I have no idea if he’s doing this out of guilt or good will. But I know he’s the last person I want to be indebted to. But I’ve been through a shitty year, a shitty life, could it get any worst than this?",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/zowmg9/tw_sa_my_abuser_wants_to_help_my_family/,t2_dprgh04a,2022-12-18 19:33:10,35
Abusive boyfriend of my friend,"I'm not sure why my friend can't break up with her boyfriend after everything he's done to her. To be honest, I'm sick of giving her advice about their relationship. He treats her like trash, saying things like ""pokpok ka, ang bobo mo, babaeng walang lipad,"" and is even proud to say that he is the one who got her virginity. Worse, he physically hurt her. My friend is lovely and comes from a loving family. And I'm not sure why she's still in this. Our classmate is already aware of what he did to her and, of course, has given her the same advice, but nothing has changed. We even advise her to file a complaint against her boyfriend, but she refuses because she believes it will jeopardize her boyfriend's dream and their relationship. I'm not sure how I can help her.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/y3yyny/abusive_boyfriend_of_my_friend/,t2_t7ein8y3,2022-10-15 00:46:09,3
Dealing with Verbal Abuse,"I have always thought that not getting angry and being calm was an admirable trait. Friends, colleagues, and family know I am not the type to shout in anger or use cuss words at people. Even in traffic I remain calm and cool.

However, I reflect back to the relationship I had with my ex-wife. Yes she was sweet when she was nice, but damn - I was dealing with someone like Hitler in a Nuremberg rally when she was fuming mad. Despite her cussing and ad hominem, I just shook my head and always begged for her to calm down. I took it all in, and never snapped back. 

Mali pala yun.

Going through therapy, I learned that such an attitude simply invites the other person to continue with abuse. There’s no boundary. The verbal abuse was “welcomed.”

It had to stop.

Taking advice from my therapist, when I had to deal with her regarding our kid or the assets, whenever she is on attack mode I make sure to talk back and stand firm. At first she was quite surprised, and even replied to me “Ah ganyan ka na magsalita ngayon ha! P*tang ina ka! Sumasagot ka na ha. Ganito na pala ha!” 

But, I pressed on also gave her something to bitterly chew on every time she said something vicious or abusive. It always hurt her when I gave her the same and drilled on her hypocrisy.

Today, my life is so different. No longer does she dare say anything against my person, my family, no longer does she demean, no longer does she throw ad hominem. She has learned to talk in a respectful way and within the boundaries.

It’s all quiet.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/wo3mad/dealing_with_verbal_abuse/,t2_jipcb7om,2022-08-14 18:54:29,11
Update : My family is siding with someone who abused me and wants me to not file a case,"TW : Mention of Attempted SA

So, I guess to start off, I need to point out that our Cyber Libel Laws sucks. Truth is NOT a defense. Kahit nagsabi ka ng totoo, as long as it puts someone under a bad light, that's possible jail time for you. I consulted with PAO and a private lawyer and it turned out, acts of lasciviousness and grave threats are lower than cyber libel. The abuser won. My best option was to settle. 

&#x200B;

My mom paid the settlement and her assets are pretty much wiped out.

&#x200B;

The only good thing that came out of this is natauhan nanay ko about our relatives. She reached out to me after I sent her the video and audio clips of what happened and screen records of the messages I received afterwards. Matagal din kami nagsagutan kasi in denial sya na magagawa ng kapatid nya yun, but I have proof.

&#x200B;

I admit to be being short tempered, pinamukha ko talaga sa kanya na for a decade plus she made me feel worthless and it's like I only existed to be her brother's yaya, punching bag, and bank account. 

She kept on telling me na di nya daw alam na ganun nangyayari sa bahay, di ko daw sinabi sa kanya na masama pala trato sa akin dun etc. I sent her all the screenshots of me telling her what's been going on to me. Saka lang nya inamin na di nya binabasa mga messages ko kapag may mention ng kahit anong sumbong. Binubura lang nya kasi daw na stressed sya sa akin. Ang sabi naman daw sa kanya ng mga kamag-anak namin eh alagang-alaga ako at buhay prinsesa ako sa bahay, which doesn't make sense dahil kapag di gusto ng kuya nya ulam or di agad ako nakapag-asikaso ng laundry, tumatawag sya agad para pagalitan ako at magluto ng bagong ulam etc. 

&#x200B;

She stepped up on the settlement pero we're still not OK. I guess dahil ayaw nya ng stress from  choosing between her brother and her own child, she lost us both. Her brother had thrown all insults in her face from calling her dumb and gullible to being a worthless mom etc... which in honesty, is the truth... Anong klaseng nanay yung nakikijoin sa pang-aalila at pang-aabuso ng sariling anak? She never believed me throughout the last decade. Her brother just said that it's not his fault that my mom is stupid and went with whatever he wanted. 

&#x200B;

I feel bad for her because she seems so lost now... But I can't get myself to just take her back. She'll probably be fine financially since her job covers her travels and hotels etc. But she has to be smart with money moving forward. 

&#x200B;

I left our city and I got help from my ex-employer's family to find a new job. I couldn't take back my pets, they are elderly and I'll be traveling often. We've all decided that it's best for them to stay with the people who took them in when I had to run away.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/126pvsx/update_my_family_is_siding_with_someone_who/,t2_vhu8iwgx,2023-03-30 23:12:04,1

I heard my abuser's name and it still triggers me,"TRIGGER WARNING: Sexual abuse

(Using a throwaway account. Andito kasi yung kapatid ko sa sub na 'to and baka makita niya. No one in my family knows that I was sexually abused by my uncle. None of my close friends also know that it happened to me.)

Putangina. Narinig ko na naman yung pangalan ng abuser ko kani-kanina lang. Matagal na 'tong nangyare, pero putangina sobrang natitrigger pa rin ako pag naririnig ko yung pangalan niya. Iniiwasan ko siya sa social media. Nasa ibang bansa siya ngayon. Ang narinig ko kila lola, uuwi yata para magpakasal and para i-adopt yung anak nung mapapangasawa niya. Putangina talaga, if only it was easy to spill everything that he did to me when I was 9 (ka-edad ko siya actually. Pinsan ni mama. Anak ng kapatid ni lola, kaya uncle ko siya).

abusive parent who threatens to s*ic*d*,"No child or partner should ever go through the experience of dealing with an abusive, narcissistic, manipulative parent. 

It's one of those nights again the whole family has to deal with a parent who threatens to unalive themselves over all these thoughts they project onto the rest of the family.

They feel unappreciated? That's because they've been verbally abusing everybody for pretty much all their lives then they act so confused as to why none of us shows affection. Treats them like trash because they don't have a job? That's their personal insecurities they project onto us when literally nobody treats them like so. We're unhelpful in the house? That's because we're constantly walking on eggshells when they switch from i dont need help gusto ko kayong pagsilbihan to putangina mga anak mayaman ba kayo. They feel that we dont listen and respect them? Honestly, at this point we don't anymore. Why would we do that when the parent doesn't listen, invalidates the effect of their abuse on us, and yet claims to be the victim and that everybody does nothing but hurt them. 

Living with an abusive parent is hell that those who didn't experience it HAVE NO FUCKING RIGHT to say ""we understand"", ""that's still your parent"" or ""you're an awful person for being angry towards them.""

The trauma, the lies, these nights where u have to restrain your abuser from unaliving themselves and then listen to all their hurt and pain but when they inflict the abuse to you, they justify it with various excuses. 

No child, husband or wife should ever go through this. The manipulation and guilt-tripping is cruel. 

If you've reached this point, i hope u dont marry to a person who is emotionally immature and just downright awful. Because when yall have kids, no child should have to parent their own parent and deal with all their emotional baggages. Kasi sa huli, pag dumating sa punto na gusto na nila mawala, dadalhin nyo yung guilt na kasalanan nyo pero ang totoo, desisyon naman talaga nila gawin lahat ng ginawa nila. 

You'd think I'd be angry at them for being like this. But honestly, im indifferent. They can do whatever they want, i honestly don't care. I'm more angry how the people i love around me isn't as detached as i am so they're still getting hurt.

confusion after years (sexual abuse),"// be kind, don't judge my grammar im dyslexic and bisaya– not good at tagalog //

I was sexually abuse when i was 8 years old by our neighbor at my grandma's province who is 15 at that time and this only happened once. i didn't know that what he was doing was rape kasi before that incident he always tells me story about sexual acts (which i thought laro lang and walang malisya) like he put his to his female friend while laughing at sasabihin nya na it feels good. 

I am 21 now, I'm confused since I'm different from other victims who got traumatized over it I mean  hindi ako naiiyak everytime i remember it pero never na akong bumalik sa province after realizing what he did. i think develop hypersexuality, it's embarrassing but i'm addicted to porn, reading nsfw since high school started when im 12 but never sexually engage with anyone and never gotten into relationship. it also gross me out that im fantasizing myself being rape or being in very toxic relationship that involves violence. i confuse and feel guilty about this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/x8vhxd/confusion_after_years_sexual_abuse/,t2_sazcyt4u,2022-09-08 17:11:24,9
My Abusive Family's Financial Problem Is Giving Me Severe Anxiety,"A little context: I've been working for about several years now. After dealing with years of abuse from my own family, especially from my mom, I decided to live alone. Eventually, I met my life partner and created our own family. My mom had millions of loans that she was trying to get me to pay. I didn't agree. She's very emotionally abusive and will gaslight me para lang mapasunod ako sa gusto nya. Dati lagi akong umiiyak kapag ginagawa nya sakin yun, but I went numb. I still give her monthly allowance dahil it's my responsibility. IDK why, but my mom would tell her partner and siblings na parang pinapabayaan namin sya. It's always the victim mindset. Sobrang nakakapagod tulungan sya. Pero wala along choice kase tulungan ko sya or hindi, ako parin and magiging masama.

&#x200B;

Now, both my mom and my sister (who also emotionally abused me) got into a very bad situation where they solely rely on me for financial help. My sister got sick and not able to work while my mom makes small money from her little business. I admit the money that I'm sending them is not enough for what they need. Their monthly needs costs about 50,000 pesos and I'm trying to provide what I can. I'm at the point where I'm contemplating of working abroad even if I really don't want to. Mind you, I earn way above the usual salary here in the PH. My salary is around 80k. But it's not enough to make the ends meet with my responsibilities. I really don't know what to do to the point I'm having panic attacks and severe anxiety. I can't sleep most of the time and have been having really bad nightmares. I can't answer my mom's calls most of the time because of this. I've been rage applying to jobs. My husband even want to learn my job so that he can help me when I apply for an additional full time job. I feel defeated. Any advise? What should I do?

I beat my sister’s abuser and I dont know what to feel,"Yes the title is exactly what you think. I (M22) have a sister (F18) who I love dearly. Our parents live and work in the province while my sister and I live in a major city for our education. My sister came out to me when she was in high school and I accepted her since I loved her very much and supported her as long as she was happy. Our parents are very religious and she was happy that I didnt turn her away (Im actually an atheist now lmao). A couple months ago she started dating this girl we will call K. My sister was head over heels for her and couldn’t wait to introduce us. I spotted a couple red flags from our first meeting together, such as insisting to hold my sister’s phone, eyeing her when she doesnt like what she sees, stonewalling her and waiting for my sister to be ‘lambing’ towards her. I didn’t want to say anything bad kasi its our first meet and maybe its just a bad impression. A couple months in and she’d usually come over to our apartment every now and then. This was no problem since she treated me respectfully enough.

Now for the story. Last week I told my sister that I’d be staying over at a friend’s house for acads and she could invite K over to keep her company. When my class ended I immediately realized I forgot something I needed for the project so I had to rush home to get it before heading over to my friend. When I got home my sister was on the floor bruised and crying, our apartment was a mess and K was on top of my sister yelling loudly enough to scare her but silently enough for the neighbors not to hear. I asked what the fuck was going on and shoved K to get off my sister. I immediately spot the eyebrow razor(idk what its called) and my sister bleeding for a few shallow cuts around her thighs and legs. This put me in a state I never want to experience again. Before I knew it I was on top of K beating her to the ground while my sister was behind me begging me to stop. For context im a relatively big guy and K is 5’3. When I realized what I was doing I got off her and called a mutual guy friend of theirs to take K home before it gets worse. I never got to properly talk to my sister after that as she barricaded herself in her room and only comes out to get the food i cook for her.

Ive had several anger related issues in the pst and have sought professional help for it. Usually when people piss me off I just let it slide because I know I dont want to deal with the consequences after whats done is done. But family also means a lot to me and seeing my sister in that state triggered a pin inside me that would blow up. I know maybe I went too far but then again I kinda feel justified for what I did. My friend’s are split between me being an asshole and me just protecting my sister. I dont want my parents to get involved because that would mean outing my sister.

I feel like shit and my sister wont even talk to me now. Please I would love to hear your thoughts on this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/z6hu2f/i_beat_my_sisters_abuser_and_i_dont_know_what_to/,t2_ulv1h7jh,2022-11-28 08:37:14,33

i want to kill my abuser,"It’s been almost 4 years since the incident and  it still haunts me. There’s a lot of things that makes the whole thing extra unbearable. (1) I wanted to file a case against him but a family friend (lawyer) somewhat discouraged me to do so. Mahina daw ang ebidensiya (even if he admitted it during sa confrontation ng family) because it’s my word against his. Not only did the lawyer said that but she also mentioned na it will cost us money and that I will have to explain in detail what happened. Alam ko naman iyon but at that time I feel like what I needed to hear was support, instead all I got is discouragement. (2) Abuser is my cousin’s husband and a lot of my relatives still talk to them despite knowing what happened. I know that I don’t (and I won’t) control who they will talk to but it still hurts kasi I love my relatives and seeing them tolerate that type of stuff feels like an insult. My cousin also insisted that I wanted it and I should just be honest about it, so fuck her too. (3) It seems like my abuser’s life is doing pretty well. I have blocked him and his kunsintidor wife on all my socials but my relatives recently posted them going to their cafe in support. It just doesn’t seem fair that I’m still in shambles from everything, still getting nightmares, still going to therapy for it and yet they’re thriving. 

Do I really want to kill my abuser, maybe. Maybe not kill but just hurt him and his wife the way they hurt me. I want their business to fail (which they opened somewhat near my university). I want them to at suffer kahit kaunti man lang. As for my relatives, I can’t force them to pick sides. I know they will pick my cousin because tita (her mom) is their sister and she died tragically of cancer at ibibilin si cousin sa kanila. 

It is gut-wrenching seeing them happy. I just want happiness for myself and I want to forget the pain of that still haunts me 4 years later.

If anyone reading this is experiencing a similar situation, i hope you heal and find peace.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/zozbvl/i_want_to_kill_my_abuser/,t2_fl3vg1d5,2022-12-18 22:03:01,2
"I feel abused, used, and exploited. Now I feel disgusted with myself.","People always taking advantage of me because they knew I’m too vulnerable.

I was trying to give this freelance job a chance, therefore, I decided to go back in the office last Saturday as I was invited to work on a small project. 
When I got there, the architect always seems nice to me even before I started working for him on different projects. Although, I know deep down his real intention every time he invites me to work in his firm. I was being nice too that’s why I accepted the offer even though I was skeptical at first because my gut instinct tells me not to go and I know him and his desires. He’s been trying to message me for months, telling me that he considered me as his admin staff but I declined it that time because I know him. But this last Saturday, I came back in the office, I needed a job even if it doesn’t pay well and being targeted into having sex is possible, I accepted the job, not with the idea of having an hook-up that day. I just sat down there while asking him for more details about the coming projects when later on he forcedly kissed and pulled me in closer to him and it just happened because I was silently stopped asking him and that’s his queue to break the silence and make his move for first base. Even though it was wrong and it’s not the reason I have gone there in the first place, I just let him do that to me, I feel disgusted with myself because I just froze there like a statue- it’s like the feeling you’re being harassed by someone but you couldn’t barely move and your head is filled with intrusive thoughts. (That’s what it feels like when you’re being victimised of sexual harassment.) (Deep inside you’re like screaming so loud but it doesn’t make a sound.) When his sexual motions started to go further, there I told him to stop, and said to him, I did not like it and I saw the look on his face, how disappointed he was in that moment. The day and the job goes on like nothing happened. He asked me to come last Sunday, and I declined. But the coming day, I came in to do the job he asked me to do with the officemates. The latter days, I asked him thru chat if I should go to work last Thursday, however, I did not go then the next day, I still did not come because I feel abused, used, exploited, and so on. 

I feel emotionally, verbally, and almost physically abused by someone else also, and that’s just another story. 

I’m too vulnerable at the moment. 
I play online games just to get by with all the bs the world is giving me in the past months. 
That’s all. 

p.s 
“When I’m away from you, I’m happier than ever”.
“just f—-leave me alone!”
