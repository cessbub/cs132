Fuck before marriage,"Just wanna share lang my own perspective. When I started exploring this culture, ang dami kong na-realize. First thing first, women are prone to abuse talaga. Especially as someone like me na hindi alam if naka-cum ba sila unlike sa men na may lumalabas. Samin kasi, sa loob lang nafefeel, parang wala siyang external thing to assure us. Chariz. Before ako pumasok sa hookup culture, nagmamasturbate na talaga ako and will ask questions from my guy friend (ka-dirty chat ko before) na experienced na. He's informative naman, talagang he knows the deal. So na-share ko sakaniya na di ko alam if naka-cum ako kasi wala namang lumabas, ano lang pulsating lang tapos grabeng throb.


 Sabi niya may mga ganon talaga, edi naisip ko what, how about yung mga girls na hindi alam if naka-cum ba sila? What, hahayaan nalang nilang gamitin sila kasi satisfied na sila don? How about yung mga nakaka-feel lang ng pleasure pero hindi naman stable to the point na makaka-cum ka talaga? Tangina it was that dangerous pala. Second, there will be times na hindi kayo compatible sa ka-fuck mo. Like for example is nung one time may naka-hookup ako na baliko medyo yung dick niya, hindi talaga siya maipasok miski sa missionary so I had to do cowgirl all the way.


 Naisip ko non, baka di compatible dick and pussy namin, kasi diba we have different forms and shapes. Kinda fascinating lang din. Then, naisip ko rin nito, paano if yung napangasawa mo hindi pala kayo compatible sa sex? Ang hirap siguro. For me kasi, sex is an art, it should be pleasurable for both parties. It's essential for me to know the sweet spot of my partner, or his/her desires. So if yung forte mo is rough, while yung partner mo e passionate gusto. Mahirap talaga. 


And I think isa rin to sa factor why nangyayari yung cheating, kasi hindi muna inaalam yung sexual desires nila (although may couple talaga na hindi big deal sex sakanila). Ewan ko, ang gulo na ang daming factors pero personally ito talaga pananaw ko. I believe dapat may sex education talaga, hindi lang siya nakakatulong to prevent pregnancy by knowing safe sex alone, but it also give us insights to discover more about ourselves and our desires. Wala pang mga abusadong lalaki na gagamiting emotional manipulation yung sex and intimate moments nila (putangina niyo sagad).  


Anyway, hindi rin naman ako mag-aasawa so kebers (unless girl I think). Scary to think lang. Ang scary ng mundo waahahaha.",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/1aupn9j/fuck_before_marriage/,t2_rytbc5dn2,2024-02-19 23:15:25,16
"PSA: Lack of Decency, Non-Consent, and Doxxing","Hello!

DADDY ISSUES: An Experience-Based Analysis,"Ahh, one of the most fetishized archetypes ever. A lot of guys fantasize or think that having a girl with daddy issues makes her exciting (I'll get to some of the reasons in a bit). In reality, there is a darkness behind the veneer of excitement and fun that these ladies exhibit.

I've been reflecting on the women I've met in the field and I've noticed certain themes that I see across multiple women. The realization that, 'hey, I've seen this before!' This series is an attempt to condense and explain the types of women that I've met. I am sure that some of these archetypes will resonate with you, either because you've dated one or if you see them in you.

I will be releasing a couple of archetypes across a couple of posts because it will be quite detailed. I have 5 archetypes lined up:

1. [Subconsciously Attached to Ex](https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/155lsue/shes_still_attached_to_her_ex_but_shes_in_denial/)
2. [Anxious Attachers](https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/157ythp/if_i_dont_respond_or_miss_her_message_she_goes/)
3. [Daddy Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/15f2dm3/daddy_issues_an_experiencebased_analysis/)
4. [Classy Young Thing](https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/15f2dm3/daddy_issues_an_experiencebased_analysis/)
5. Angels

Today we will be focused on the ladies who are very loving, loyal, expressive but can get very demanding of attention and reassurance from you.

**Important disclaimer**: this post is not meant to disparage, criticize, or shame any female or females that fall within a certain archetype. These are merely my observations, personal experience, and reflections which I'd like to share. I learned something while interacting with these types of females, perhaps you can learn something from this too.

# Daddy Issues (Rare)

**Identification:** Getting involved with someone with DIs is... an experience. They spend a lot of time & money on their appearance, and based on looks alone, they usually look out of your league. When you show them attention, you get surprised that they reciprocate attention to you as well, even if you think you're an average guy. You continue to talk, then get intimate, then both agree to get together. You have your fun - it's super intense - but a few weeks later, it's over and she is now seeing a new guy.

**Profile Analysis:** I believe that Ladies with Daddy Issues (DI) fall under 2 types:

\- Type A: They tend to dress provocatively, usually playful or flirty with their language, post thirst traps on their socials, usually very DTF (usually bar is low with their partners), have vices (usually vaping, alcohol, some cases illegal substances), typically have partners that are at least 5 years older than them (usually they go for guys in their 30s+), and rotates partners frequently. Highly to engage in sex work.

\- Type B: Pays attention to their appearance, but generally dresses less provocatively. Not very DTF - looks for partners that will commit to them, and settles for low quality partners due to fear of abandonment.

I've had the most experience with ladies with the Type A variant of DI, so that will be the focus of this section.

What I've observed with ladies with DIs is that they are dopamine-hungry and constantly look for emotional highs, and their go to stimulus is male attention. They also are on a constant search for excitement & novelty, because they get bored easily, which means they like casting a wide net and putting themselves in situations (e.g. clubs, risky friend groups, etc.) where they can get maximum attention.

There's a key difference between a manipulative/narcissistic lady vs. a lady with DI. The manipulative/narcissistic lady thinks highly of themselves and they usually use attention/sex for an objective. They think of themselves as a precious resource and they are strategic in leveraging their sexuality.

The lady with DIs pursues dopamine hits and emotional highs above all else. The highs are the ultimate end for them and to pursue it, nothing is sacred. Their body isn't sacred, their partner isn't sacred, their relationship isn't sacred -- it doesn't matter to them as long as they get their hit. And I don't mean this in a 'sadgirl'/emo type of way, they're just indifferent to the implications and consequences of their actions. By the way, the intensity of the pursuit of these hits depends on the severity of the DI.

The common features that I've observed with the DI ladies I've met are a (1) lack of a father figure and a (2) lack of good female role models in healthy relationships. My hypothesis behind their behavior and mentality:

The lack of a father figure has distorted their view of themselves and their bodies/dignity. Good father figures often are trained to protect, nurture, and respect women, so they serve as a benchmark to their daughters of what a 'good man' is like and helps them develop a good sense of self. The lack of guidance leaves them vulnerable to negative influences (there's a lot these days), which leads to a lack of standards, boundaries, and addiction to these dopamine hits.

The lack of good female role models in healthy relationships means that they are not familiar with what is generally viewed as a 'proper' relationship - e.g. faithfulness, resolving conflicts, etc. So they tend to go with emotions/feelings and attraction when it comes to staying in relationships. They tend not to consider the dangers of staying in abusive relationships or discarding a proper - yet boring - partner.

**Additional Notes**: I strongly believe that those with daddy issues are at a huge long-term risk. Based on experience, their reward-seeking / hedonistic behavior puts them in a lot of risk. They expose themselves to a large number of men, and because of the law of large numbers and their lower standards, they have a higher-than-average chance of coming face-to-face with an abusive man.

The sad thing is that usually, their behavior doesn't stop with sleeping around. They also usually have one or both of either alcoholism and substance abuse, further exposing them to physical issues or risky situations.

**Personal Thoughts**: They are also most likely to be engaging in sex work to fund their lifestyle, given their high libido. Anecdotally, I had a fling with an escort who had severe Daddy Issues. Usually the reason for ladies who engage in sex work is because they need money for their family or pay for their education. It's always a means to an end, and most of them have a strong desire to quit immediately (source: I have handler contacts).

My fling's reason? ""I do it for fun. I feel loved whenever I'm in bed with a man because he gives me attention."" The next thing that she said: ""Men all just want the same thing. I might as well get something out of it."" That's not a healthy way of thinking. In more vulgar terms, that's fucked up.

(Side note: we didn't meet through a paid encounter. I may post about the experience in the future because it was a very interesting situationship. I will also walk through what my principle are towards sex work and paying for sex if I do make that post.)

Out of all the archetypes of females I've been with/dated, I feel the most sadness for those with legit daddy issues.

# Advice

**Ladies**

>I will be blunt here - if you have this issue, most likely you will acknowledge that you have DI but you will say that you do not care, because you're getting what you want, and that is the only thing you care about.

&#x200B;

>I will say though that time and gravity catches up to all of us. Your youthful beauty will not last forever. You may feel invincible and unstoppable now (I've been there when I was younger), thinking that you'll be different from the 'old people' who warn you. But we can never fully escape the consequences of our actions and time dispenses fair judgment.

&#x200B;

>You have value, and it's just not because of your outer beauty and sex appeal. Do not squander this value by exchanging it for fleeting emotional highs. I hope that you choose to invest in becoming a woman of true substance, where you do not view yourself as valuable as long as you are desirable to men. I'm rooting for you.

**Gentlemen**

>Have your fun and treat her well. Be the guy who treats like she should be treated. Etch the experience in your memories because your time with her will be very intense. But don't cling to her - she's not yours, it's only your turn.

&#x200B;

>From a broader standpoint, I hope that if you're a father, please treat your daughters well. Train them up in the way they should go. Be a good role model and be present in their lives so that they can see what a proper man looks like. It is not a guarantee that things like these will not happen, but it will make a difference in your daughter's life.",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/15f2dm3/daddy_issues_an_experiencebased_analysis/,t2_8368rfvik,2023-08-01 12:43:13,24
""" I regret my Hoe Phase ""","This is not gonna be juicy so if you're not interested then just skip.


Lagi ko ito nababasa dito sa AJ laging may nag o-open up about dito na they kinda regret having a past. Mostly babae o kaya they open up like being embarassed having a past or what they call a hoe phase. Baka kasi wala na daw lalaki mag take seriously sa kanila. 


This post is like gonna be a guide questions that you need to ask yourself before you start having a hoe phase. I apply it to myself too.



1.) Do it for the right reason(even if its not for the right reason just be fucking honest to yourself. Why do you want to do this?)
2.) Have realistic expectations
3.) Everything has consequence. 


A.) Do it for the right reasons.

What are your reason? And why are you doing this? 

Sasabihin ng ibang babae ""its empowerment"" ""all of my friends are doing it why can't I?"" ""If men can do it, I can do it too!!!"" ""Sexual exploration"" 

Pero most of the time the reason is they use sex as a coping mechanism.

1. Sawa na sila sa monogamy kasi lagi na lang sila naloloko nag aapply ito sa both genders
2. They've been sexually abused in the past.
3. You're insecure and you want the opposite gender's validation. Basically you want someone to feed your ego. 

Hindi ko sasabihin sayo kung ano yung right reason para sa'yo kasi ikaw lang ang nakakaalam nun. As I said before even if its not for the right reason like have the self awareness to admit it to yourself that you're using sex as a coping mechanism. 

Its like trying cigarette for the first time. I'm gonna be honest, I try smoking before because it looks cool. Yeah, its petty pero ang astig ehh. Kaya siguro ito yung reason at di ako na adik sa yosi kasi di ako nag sinungaling sa sarili ko. Yung iba sinasabi pa ""masarap kasi manigarilyo pampakalma"" ""masarap manigarilyo habang tumatae"" ""masarap manigarilyo pag tapos kumain"" yada  yada. Even if you're not doing it for the right reason. Just have the self awareness that you're doing it for the wrong reasons. 


B.) Have realistic expectation. 

Casual sex is mostly bad sex walang magsasabi sa'yo niyan mas lalo na pag babae ka. Lahat ng ayaw mo maramdaman bilang babae mararamdaman mo sa hoe phase. You're gonna feel use and you're gonna feel objectified. 

Sa lalaki nag kakaroon lang naman ng bad sex madalas hindi sa casual sex madalas sa marriage hahaha. Pag na-stuck ka sa sexless marriage. Kasi lalaki basta may penetrative sex and BJ goods na hahaha. Eh sa babae? Andami pang ritual. Sa lalaki magiging bad sex lang siya its either she makes you feel like a rapist for wanting sex or lack of enthusiasm.

Maraming rin babaeng nag cocomplain like bakit daw wala manlang aftercare sex o kaya yung lalaki ginoghost sila pagtapos(kantot kalimot jutsu). Di manlang daw siya kinakain. Siya lang daw palagi nag eeffort. 

Why do you think is that? 

Because you're whore. I don't want to say it but that's what it is. Kaya nga sabi ko sayo lahat ng ayaw mo maramdaman bilang babae mararamdaman mo sa hoe phase. Majority ng makakasalamuha mo diyan is puro fckboy. Sa tingin mo may pakialam sila sa pleasure ng pokpok? Of course wala sino ka ba? You're just a random hoe for them. A cum dump. A sexual object. 

Syempre ayaw namn kitang gawing negative syempre may makikilala ka ring sex god na fuckboy diyan. Oo meron pero most of the time its like a gacha game paswertihan. Minsan makakakilala ka nga kaso overcompensated alpha male naman. Minsan may makikilala kang lalaki na perfect fuckboy na boyfriend material. Dito minsan natatrap yung ibang babae na parang naiinlove sa ka fck buddy. They want a relationship pero yung lalaki ayaw pa mag settle down. Minsan magiging kabit ka rin na di mo namamalayan.


Kaya dito nagiging flawed yung reason ng babae na they want a hoe phase is to sexually explore kasi if you really wanna sexually explore ang pinaka the best way is to find a boyfriend that cares for you. Kasi yung lalaki na yun boyfriend mo natural may pakialam siya sa pleasure mo unlike sa ibang lalaki na tingin sayo pokpok. There's nothing wrong being a hoe if you really enjoy being a hoe and being treated like a hoe then do it sulit na sulit sayo yung hoe phase. 

C.) Everything has consequence.

Pag uminom ka pwede ka magkasakit sa atay. Pag nanigarilyo ka pwede ka magkasakit sa baga. Ano worst case scenario pag nagkaroon ka ng hoe phase?


Wag na tayo mag gaguhan dito majority ng long term prospect mo in dating is kokonte. Hindi siya mauubos pero kokonte kasi itutulak mo majority ng lalaking seryoso palayo. Nag aapply ito on both genders. Iniisip ng mga lalaki na being promiscuous doesn't affect them but it does too. 


Lagi itong pinag uusapan dito. Papatol ka ba sa taong may high body count? Red flag ba yung may high body count? 


Is a girl with a high body count a red flag? For me, its debatable because it depends on the person. May babaeng promiscuous that can handle monogamy at may mga babaeng may ""good girl"" image at low body count na cheater pag nakatalikod jowa niya sumasakay siya sa carousel tapos iba't ibang kabayo.


Hindi ito aaminin ng mga lalaki kasi iba iba tayo eh pero its not red flag per se. It more of a turn off. Wag na tayo mag gaguhan pag nalaman mo yung current girlfriend mo may gangbang history. There's always this ick na you're not gonna see her the same way. That's why some women lie or they don't want to talk about their past. Because its not a red flag, its mostly a turn off. Hindi mo pa napapatunayan sarili mo alam mong disqualified ka na. 

Alam nyo naman siguro yung mga scientific reason why being promiscuous is not a good indicator when looking for a potential long term partner so di ko na sasabihin kasi alam ko majority sainyo alam na which is yung pair bonding. Explain ko na lang siya in simple terms. Example is scotch tape, pag yung scotch tape dinikit mo at tinanggal mo ng ilang beses mawawala yung dikit niya. Ganun din sa relationship. Sa sobrang dami mong beses nakipag sex dadating yung point na mahihirapan ka na makipag connect sa isang tao. 

Pag nagkaroon ka ng hoe phase tanggapin mo man o hindi magkakaroon ka ng commitment issue. Parang katulad ng ibang addiction for example yosi. Kahit na simulan mo mag quit ngayon magkakaroon at magkakaroon ka ng withdrawal symptoms. Ganun din sa hoe phase mahihirapan ka mag transition sa monogamy niyan kasi para sayo its gonna be fcking boring. 

Lastly but not the least magkakaroon ka ng ibang image sa opposite gender. Pag ikaw lalaki ka at nag ka hoe phase iisipin mo majority ng babae pokpok kasi puro lang sila nakakasalamuha mo. Pag sa babae namn isipin mo Men are trash. Pervert. They just use women for sex yada yada. Paano ba namn hindi, puro fckboy lang din nakakasalamuha mo. 

The consequence your gonna face most of the time

1. Long term prospect is di namn mauubos pero mahihirapan ka humanap
2. Pair bonding/commitment issue
3. Gonna create false narrative to the opposite gender. 



Ps. Di ko na sinama dito yung mga std tska pagiging emotionally unavailable kasi majority namn alam yun. Its so common that if you're sexually active you have the high risk of having std. Tsaka being emotionally unavailable kasi di ka makaka survive sa hoe phase kung puro ka feelings. Madedevelop mo itong habit ng pagiging emotionally unavailable.


Ps. Bakit ko ito pinost? Para ito mostly sa mga late teens or early 20s na babae na nacucurious if they still want to undergo hoeing around. Kasi sa social media masyadong ninormalize yung hoe phase na para bang kala mo walang consequence na mangyayari. In the end of the day you can do whatever you want matanda ka na di ka na bata. Sa lalaki naman kasi iba even if you want to be promiscuous not everyone can be promiscuous because its a constant competition. ""Men earned sex, women doesn't."" I hope makatulong din ito sa lalaki.


Tl;dr: may mga hindi naka intindi ng post ko pero sige eto. Ang purpose niya is to help other people lessen the regret and be accountable sa mga desisyon nila. Kaya nga nag bigay ako ng guide questions 

1. Do it for the right reason or just be honest to yourself what really is the reason.
2. Have realistic expectation(like literally imagine the worst case scenario pero kung sa tingin mo ayus lang then just do it there's nothing wrong being sexually active.) Nag bigay lang ako ng example diyan kasi for me ayan yung mga worst case scenario
3. Everything has consequence(weigh the risk and reward ratio ng gagawin mo)

Last message: there's nothing wrong being a hoe or being sexually active. Ang nakikita ko lang mali madalas yung iba pumapasok sa gantong lifestyle hindi nila alam magiging effect sa kanila. 


Kung ayus lang namn sayo yun the go humayo kayo at kumantot ng marami. Buhay nyo yan i can't control you. I don't have the right to dictate what's right or wrong. In the end of day that's your life. Kahit na isa lang matulungan ng post ko then its ok I'm happy kasi ang nakikita ko sa social media masyadong siyang hype na di nila alam na may negative consequence din sila mararanasan pag di nila ito tinake seriously.",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/13dtaoc/i_regret_my_hoe_phase/,t2_azxh9614e,2023-05-10 23:02:49,115
Need advice,"So my bf and I both in our late teens want to have a threesome ffm. Nung una ayaw ko as in never and ayaw ko parin naman talaga pero ever since he cheated on me multiple times and has pressured me to have a threesome pumayag na rin ako. Maybe napagod nalang din ako sa kakatanong niya and it did turn me on too since I am bi but at the same time, I know once na mangyari yun in the future alam ko sa sarili ko na hindi siya ang papakasalan ko. Sinabi ko na yun before sakanya na okay lets have a threesome pero di kita papakasalan sobra kami nag-away nun. I love him with all my heart but if we are talking about libog, libog nalang din kaya ko ibigay hindi na pagmamahal maybe because of the cheatings and abuse that happened too. I feel a bit forced pero at the same time, sobrang napagod nalang din ako sa lahat. So my plan is, once na magthreesome na nga kami in the future maybe in 5 years? Once we are really ready, I am planning to break up with him after the threesome or ghost him di ko alam basta alam ko di ko na nakikita sarili ko sakanya nun. Our rs is also toxic as hell. And I just cannot imagine being married to a guy like him kasi ako alam ko na sa sarili ko na once we get married. He would still fuck around behind my back. Maybe I am getting way ahead of myself pero may instinct kasi tayo diba. Usapan namin na once lang mangyayari and yun din gusto nya kasi alam nya madali ako magkagusto sa babae.

 If I would describe our relationship, sobrang emotionally and mentally draining. Imagine being with a guy who told you na mamatay ka na lang dahil umiiyak ka sakanya about sa cheating shit nya? Ang rason niya sakin is he feels lost because he is entering his twenties hindi niya daw alam ginagawa niya sa buhay nya. I know to myself na I am also slowly slipping away from him and our relationship in general. I am beyond broken but I can't leave because of the trauma bond. 

Am I too cruel to leave him hanging once na makipag-break ako sakanya after ng threesome? Pero sana deep inside my heart, sobrang mahal na mahal ko siya to the point na sana siya nalang talaga yung lalaking papakasalan ko. Kasi from the start akala ko siya na yung lalaki magiging tatay ng mga anak ko. But I just cannot imagine having a family with a guy like that. A guy na tite ang pinapairal hindi yung utak. He never once showed any efforts sa relationship namin. I asked him myself kelan yung last time na nag-effort man lang siya samin. Wala siya nasagot. He told me na bata pa siya and he might change dahil gusto lang naman niya mag-explore. But whats my assurance? Ni hindi ko nga kaya mag-open ng thoughts ko ng hindi niya ako minumura. Am I the bad one here? 

I just want someone to talk to so if anyone is available to even call or chat just lmk. I want to clear my thoughts too.",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/pijsii/need_advice/,t2_9dh6caqi,2021-09-06 03:41:10,27
The girl who had never experienced orgasm.,"We matched in Tinder. She said she’s looking for some fun night. 🥰

Usapan nmin inuman at food trip lng. I went to her apartment, 7pm. She’s morena, mid 20s, big boobs, pleasant face and a friendly vibe. She has whiskers when she smiles, yung parang tatlong lalim s pisngi na parang whiskers ng pusa pag ngumingiti sya. We ordered two boxes of shakey’s pizza and miktea na nauwi s malalim n kwentuhan about life, family and career goals.

Di nagtagal nadaanan NSFW topics. Sabi nya hindi raw sya naniniwala that a lady can reach orgasm. She had an ex for 6 years, and had been single for four years now. She had dated some guys but few minutes lng daw wala na. So she never had experienced orgasm ever in her life. I told her I met a girl who can cum 25 times in two hours. [see story here](https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/qy1n7u/the_girl_who_can_cum_20_times_in_2_hours/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) I told her that a woman in order to be aroused fully, two things needed to be secured first (tips po sa mga guys, tulong ko na sa sambayanan): physical security and emotional security (kahit pa mapawet mo yan kung di yan cgurado emotionally, hindi yan masasarapan; at kahit p sigurado n sya sau pero hindi sya at ease s lugar kung nsan kau, hindi rin yan maaroused fully) If magawa ng lalaki yun, next (na ginagawa ko) is pushing nlng ng sexual buttons (can be done via kissing, foreplay or sa gaya ko I am maximizing the use of yoni massage; hindi ko na iisa-isahin ung mga sexual buttons kc marami at iba-iba rin bawat girls; common erogenous spots: mouth/ lips, earlobes, neck, nape, breast, nipples, lower back, inner thighs, behind the knee, feet.. ayan ha, pamigay n yan.. then pang lastly p ung clit at vagina. Ikutan mo muna lahat yan tapos saka mo icheck kung nagsisimula ng bumaha ang batis s timog. Always be gentle)

We moved s ibang topics pero she confessed n hindi raw mawala sa isip nya ung babae na 25 times nag-orgasms, samantalang sya ni-isa wala. So sabi ko, “You want to experience it ba?”. Hindi na kami natuloy sa inuman kc mukhng ibang uhaw yung gusto nyang maibsan.

I gave her a 30-minute body massage prelude. I started knocking on her sexual buttons during the massage too, lumalalim n paghinga s bawat paghimas at hagod ko s mga erogenous zones nya (guys, wag kc pasok agad kaya ang daming babae ang hindi n naniniwala sa orgasm eh.. hehehe ✌🏻). Then I started doing yoni na, ayun first seven minutes 4 times nilabasan.  Nagulat din sya, she said “Ganun pala yung feeling, ang sarap, para kang sasabog at napapatayo, at para akong naiihi, tapos bigla kang may mararamdaman na lumalabas sa loob.” Her words, not mine.

Next, I educate her with the parts of her vagina, her pleasure points and ano best position for her to reach those pleasure points. She is one of the few vaginas that I experience exploring na maraming pleasure points inside at halos walang nodules of tensions (numb or overly sensitive part ng pempem ng babae at ito ung ways ng vagina to encapsulate ung mga sexual trauma because of past unwanted sex, physical abuse or ung sex na hindi tlga nila naenjoy). Halos 30% sa nahawakan kong pempem has these nodules of tensions, one may even had starting a vaginismus (alam ko guys these are not sexy terms but medical terms, pero it will help you sa iba pang sexcapades nyo if you read about them too).

Balik sa action, another 30 minutes at ayun naka additional 10 n orgasm p sya (multi-orgasmic pla sya, wala lng nagparanas s kanya). She had then uttered these words under her breathe, “Pasukin mo na ako.” She wanted to experience my dick inside her. One of the beauty of making a lady reach orgasm is they will say and do everything you want pag nasa rurok n sila ng libog nila.

Kinain ko muna sya, in which she also had an orgasm, and then ask her to BJ me bago ko ipasok. I was the second time plng na-BJ nya kc hindi raw nya gusto ung ganun pero this time hindi nya alam kung bakit sarap n sarap sya (isa pang benefit ng napa-orgasm ang babae, lahat ay nagiging masarap, malaki, mahaba at mataba sa mata ng mga babae after you bring them to their climax, lalo n kung multi-orgasmic). Understandably sloppy pero good enough para maging super hard si junjun so I can enter her. She requested no condom (may bad experience daw sya) and just do nlng withdrawal. Sinagad ko, at pra syang mababaliw sa sarap. Missionary, butterfly and double leg-up, hindi n nya alam kung saan kakapit, sa unan, sa kama, sa kamay ko, sa ulo ko, lahat na hinawakan nya habang nangingisay ang katawan nya. I had to control for some times para mas maexperience p nya ung sarap for an extended period of time, and when she’s satisfied binilisan ko n para ako nmn. I had withdrawn and release it all s body nya. Mula s pagkahugot sa pempem nya umabot ng tenga at buhok nya ung modta ko. I had flying sperms. She’s covered with my cum s boobs and stomach nya. I reached some tissues from my bag and helped her clean.

We had some kwentuhan p ulit while nagtatawan kc parang may gel daw ung buhok nya. We bid farewell afterwards. It was a great date.",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/regl3t/the_girl_who_had_never_experienced_orgasm/,t2_auc2r496,2021-12-12 12:04:40,124
PSA - to all the ladies of AJ and PHGW,"Heads up to all the ladies, a bunch of us recently found out that a person who is very active on this sub and a few other ph subs, has been purposely lying to women about some very important details about himself to get them to sleep with him. These lies include:

1. His age. He claims to be in his early thirties (between 30-34), but he's really a middle aged man. He uses an old photo on tg. 

2. His relationship status. He claims to be single, but he has a long term partner.

3. When his last sexual contact was. He tells women that he's sure he's safe and he hasn't had any partners in months. This isn't true as some of these women overlapped with each other. 

4. I could go on for days about the things he lied about, there were a lot. He even lied about some things that he didn't really need to lie about. 


Lying about these very important things is a total asshole move in itself, but it gets worse. He claimed exclusive status with some of the women to get them to forego using protection. Some of these arrangements have been going on for months. Some were casual, some were not. I am calling him out not only because he's a lying, cheating, asshole, but also because he is putting other people's safety at risk (including his long term partner) which is a very real concern. He has also caused some heavy emotional damage to some of these women. Something that they have to work through for weeks, even months, after all this is over. 


His MO/description are as follows: 

1. You would hardly recognize him when you meet in person. He looks totally different from the pic on his tg and the ones he'll be sending you. 

2. He will call you ""babe"" all the time. He will claim this is what he calls all his female friends, but this is so he doesn't confuse names. 

3. He will lure you in with the nice guy/sensitive guy routine to get you to trust him. He might even tell you a sob story about an abusive ex or something like that. 

4. He will be very persistent to meet up with you. Weeks or months of you not responding will not deter him.

5. He targets mostly women from alasjuicy and phgw. He has more than one account and will sometimes message you using more than one of them. 

6. He will only message you during work hours, very rarely at night, and almost never on sundays. He will only ever ask to meet during weeknights/lunch hour/early morning. 

7. He will give you a fake name and when caught, he will tell you that he just doesn't want any social media drama. This is so you can't find him on social media and find out the truth about him. 

8. When you call out his shady behavior, he will somehow shift the focus on you and make you feel bad for doubting him. 

If you think you're in contact with him, please know that he's probably lying to you about a lot of things. Also, please get tested as soon as you can. 

To him, if he is reading this, I am not doing this to shame you. I am doing this because you need to stop. Your actions have very real consequences for other people. I hope you learn that someday. 

Please don't message me to ask who he is. I am not going to tell you. I am choosing to show him the kindness and respect that he deserves as a human being. Even if he wasn't capable of extending the same courtesy to me and all the other women who are a part of this.

Edit: Ladies, I'm so sorry. Ang dami na natin. I feel so bad for all of us : (",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/dom7pu/psa_to_all_the_ladies_of_aj_and_phgw/,t2_4wewovwb,2019-10-29 14:59:07,149

"A note of thanks for all the AJ stories, and the PHGW nudes","Warning: Long post and a rant. TL;DR: Thank you for the AJ stories, and the PHGW nudes.

I have been on and off of Whisper since 2014, and during that time I have had the opportunity of chatting with several interesting people. Most are regular people who are just want to vent or speak out anonymously. For the most part, they want to reach out to other people.

In the years I've been on Whisper, there have been plenty of chats which border on the fantastic. However, since these are anonymous, I don't give need to check for their veracity, or the credibility of the other party. There are stories about abuse, as well as some sexual escapades.

After a while you would have this feeling that the story was true. Either the storyteller was insistent, and the words are too emotional. You can talk a lot about something in one chat session of several hours. Or with some people, the chat continues for months, and the stories flesh out and have form. With questions and answers, the story behind the story emerges. The covering half-truths are uncovered and replaced with more plausible events.

Some of the stories narrated to me through chat included the girl who had a foreign ""boyfriend"" who wanted to see her get fucked by another man. She was having second thoughts about that, but she didn't want to let go of the boyfriend, especially since the guy promised they were going to Thailand.

There was also this lady who told a story about having sex on the beach at Puerto Galera, among other escapades. There have been a few ladies I have chatted with who say that they have anal sex during their period. Of course, there are a few who narrate their threesome and gangbang experiences.

Through all of those stories, I have listened, sometimes I have also re-read those stories. My opinion about the stories does not count. It is their story. I just so happened to be the one on the other end of the chat. So what if it's unbelievable. It doesn't matter to them if I believe it or not. What matters is that the chat, for them, is a venue for their thoughts. It just so happens that they cannot keep their thoughts to themselves. They have to tell someone.

I may have been guilty of goading them with questions, to draw out more information. This is a guilty pleasure, which is as pleasurable as reading AJ stories. It's their Whisper or AJ story and I don't need to judge them because they don't care what thoughts that I may have. For them, they told someone a story, or a secret, which they cannot tell anybody else. I am the anonymous ear they throw their voice to in the vast wilderness of a dark internet. AJ is a repository of stories which they cannot tell their closest kin.

There are also those who send nudes. In most instances, I don't have to ask for the nudes. I only have to wait, maybe hours, maybe months, until they send nudes of their own volition. What does a pussy look like? Pussies come in different shapes, sizes, color, and levels of bushiness. In the old days, there was one guy who even sent me a picture he picked up from the internet of a pussy riddled with sores. He wanted to piss me off.

It takes ordinary, regular women of all sizes a long time before they decide to take a picture of themselves, or their body parts. There is a lot of emotional and psychological baggage with nude selfies. It is not easy for a woman to take a picture of their boobs. It doesn't matter if it is a cub A or a cup C. It is difficult and challenging for them. It is even harder for a woman to get up the courage to take a picture of their pussy.

I have taken pussy pics, including a couple of women who have contributed to PHGW. It takes some guts for them to pose nude for a guy with a camera. It is easier for them to shoot a selfie, or mirror-selfie, or a self-portrait with a camera and tripod, because they can delete the picture if they don't like what they shot. After a picture is taken, it takes more thought before they decide to post it on PHGW. I was a stranger when I met them in person. But, I think, that most of the PHGW pics started that way: shy women doubting if their pics would be appreciated. Women who have self-doubts.

I know how difficult that can be because I posted to PHLBGW when it was first put up. It gets easier the more pictures you take, or the more pictures you post. Still, it is a chore, and not a trivial matter.

It is just sad that there is still a lot of fat shaming on PHGW and even on PHR4R. There is also a lot of ageism on PHR4R. This is also true of Whisper.

One reason for the reticence is the self-image. Almost everyone thinks they are not sexy. I think otherwise. I think that if you have sexy thoughts, you can have a sexy outlook, which leads to a sexy person. If a lady posts on PHGW, I make it a point to press on the UP button. It's my way of encouraging her to post more pics, and a way to boost her self-esteem. I am very grateful for the pictures and those who took the time to post their pictures. Their efforts are greatly appreciated.

I am grateful for the stories which I heard on Whisper. I am grateful for all the guys and girls who post stories on AJ. I don't care if anybody else says these are too fantastic to be true. You post it, I'll read it and will give my thanks for the pleasure of a well written story.

If anyone wants to have a QA put up on AJ or PHGW, I say, go ahead and create one on your own subreddit. I will support your efforts.",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/e52osc/a_note_of_thanks_for_all_the_aj_stories_and_the/,t2_jtcn4zm,2019-12-03 01:55:48,47
22 body count for 2022! hoe phase = ✅,"Disclaimer! :> By no means did I intend to promote substance USE or ABUSE, just want to share my experience. At isa pa, I am not promoting the hoe phase thing, it’s the most emotionally exhausting thing to get involved in, besides sa pagiging grade conscious. Practice safe sex, huwag niyo akong tularan. tenoutoftenbjs account has become some sort of diary for me, I put my heart into what I wrote. lol

TLDR: Finally reached my desired 22 counts, here's the kalokohan from yesterday to today! Last 5. Let’s go No Nut November 🤙🤙🤙

18 was a good Samaritan. Picked me up when I ‘purposely’ let myself get stranded in a mall. He was my type. Quite malaman and tall. He rocked a man bun, tinali ko pa. He was very accommodating tapos makwento so game na game ako. We weren’t supposed to check in pero after blowing him sa sasakyan, nadala na din. lol He was so vanilla. It was different from what I had before. He would diin it on the right moment, super satisfying. We had one round. I kept bottle caps as a keepsake of my time with him.

19 offered 420. I would never refuse to smoke. It was my first full-on car fun. I sucked him, then we move sa backseat for a more comfortable sucking. At one point, I even rimmed him. He fucked me and came on my tummy. He rated my bj 8/10 so medjo nalungkot ako. I took it as a sign to retire. He was quite generous though, let me hithit a lot. Keepsake is a mask packaging.

I was hatid sa mall na sabog na. I almost fell lol when I was lining up sa KFC. Right after eating, I rode a taxi to another place. Anglo, Mandaluyong. I booked an appointment for extensive testing pero hindi natuloy kasi bagyo. Pinalipat ako sa Luxecare, Starmall, and there I got free HIV testing. Result? Non-reactive. :> Sabog pa ako around this time pero manageable naman.

20 was a threesome with #13. It was so sponty, it was crazy. Having a dick in each hand was an experience. Si Princess na bahala sa kwento dito. I’ll peer pressure him to write one. The first time threesome experience was chill lang. If playing with one dick is satisfying, this was quite extra. Lalo na when giving handjobs to both of them. Lakas giggle ko dito, enjoyable af. I may have some audio pero still not quite sure if I’ll post it kasi super kalog. 

21 was another good Samaritan who I spent the night with. He might be my favorite sa araw na yun. He was tall and saktong malaman, a very non-prying person din which is so appreciated. I am a very sentimental and emotional person. So after ng sesh with the 2 boys, nalungkot na naman ako. This person didn’t ask much about why I had no place to stay that night. And yeah, I purposely acted ‘stranded’ again. Sumabay ang ulan sa kalokohan ko.

We got in his place and he has a dog! A cute black doggy na wala daw breed but mukhang meron. Naunahan pa siya ng dog niya to hump me XD and honestly, it was so fucking cute and hilarious. I’m scared of dogs pero nagustuhan ko yung doggy. What a good boy haha. He got stressed over the dog’s behavior kaya medjo napagod siya. (honestly medjo hayok si doggy, he ain’t getting some ata huhu XD) He then arranged a sofa bed for me as  I was ‘couch-surfing’ kuno.

But nothing happened that night or so I thought. The next day, he apologize for hugging me daw and for touching my boobs. I didn’t feel a thing when I was sleeping. Honestly, I found it hot. When I woke up early that morning to pee, he was inches away from me, not touching at all, kaya nga hindi ko halos maisip na it happened. (and for what was supposed to be couch-surfing, tinabihan niya ako :> )

Little did he know, and I’m saying this only here that I purposely went braless for the naughty stuff sana. This is the moment where communication should've happened coz we got lost in translation. XD

It was only on his lunch break (wfh) when things got naughty, I ‘innocently’ brush my teeth and scrape my tongue to prep for a blowjob. (my brand) I asked him if he wants one, and he said yes. I asked him to wash up, and he did. 

TIP: Ask them to wash up before every blowjob, even if they claim na they showered na or they did wash na. It avoids those ‘ang baho niya’ moments, and yeah, a way to save yourself. Also, wash your mouth before bj, man. Brush your teeth, floss, and scrape your tongue. Make it the most wonderful event ever. It adds to the oral game. Sa mga receiver naman, if sabing wash, just comply. ;)

He was a grower. *nagwala* A mouthful. He feels nice on my tongue. I tend to test my limits in deep throating kaya ginagawa ko yun as soon as I know na it’s madulas with my laway enough. (fucking kaconyohan haha) Well, kaya. ;) I told him I cannot pene today as I was sore from last night, and he said okay lang which I appreciated. I let him fondle my boobs. hehe As I was so insecure about getting an 8/10 the day before na nag-overthink ako, sinabayan ko ang bj ng lubed-up handjob. I was enjoying the moment seeing him squirm and laugh. He laughs when he’s sensitive. *namatay sa cuteness* I have an audio of this but I still have to think about it kasi again, kalog and this time may backtrack pa ng Friends episode na we left playing as we do the deed. Ang cute niya. Iniipit niya ako when he gets stimulated. Thicc thighs, god damn. *nabaliw* He eventually came in my hands. It was enjoyable huhu. I liked it a lot. 

I can still smell his perfume on me kasi humingi ako before going. He gave me his power bank as a keepsake. Cute. It’s gonna be my most used item ever. I brushed my teeth again as I plan to meet 22nd.

22 let me dirty carpool with him back to Manila. He parked sa favorite SM branch ko and we did naughty things sa back seat. Again, no pene but I was more than satisfied to make him cum twice. The first time, I swallowed, and the second, sa boobs. I wasn’t sure about my boobjob game because this was my first time, but he came sa b-cup ko. :) I got a snowbear wrapper as a keepsake which reminds me of my late grandma. Sweet 22nd. Nice person.

This concludes my 22 for 2022 thing. It was worthwhile. Thank you to all the people!

I’ll be ending my hoe phase here, and also gonna be doing nnn, and #SoberNovember haha sana hindi matukso

Umiyak Before Fuck?,"Hi AJ! Happy holidays! 

Q: Have you ever encountered someone who cried before the deed because of their past traumatic sexual encounters?

KWENTO: 3 years ago, I dated a nurse na liban sa nagpatayo ng ulo ko, napatayo din niya ung mga red flags noong unang nag-match kami sa Tinder. 

Why? Para akong nakipag-usap sa HS dahil may mga certain limitations siya tulad ng no calls, no late night chats, strict parents, at indecisive. Atras abante!

With these uneasy feels, I gave it a go at tuloy ang kuya mo makipag-usap sa kanya. We eventually dated, pero sa unang meet, pinag-antay niya ako ng 3 oras sa ospital ng walang malinaw na dahilan - puro saglit at patapos dahilan niya. Of course, sanay tayo sa waiting game at pahirapan sa endorsement ng pasyente sa ER 😅

Eventually, nawala galit ko dahil ang ganda pala niya sa personal, even though dry hands niya, 5'1, petite, and HS looking, she have this pair of boobs na nakakalunod dahil proporsionately malaki siya at mestisa.

KAILAN UMIYAK: As we go a long, nagkakainitan na kami and eventually had some fun on chat to the point we checked-in to do the deed!

She told me before na she likes to be dominated and used to be treated rough in bed ng hindi nagkakaroon ng plenty of experiences to be pleased and have an orgasm. At dahil cheerful giver ako, I made her tie my hands and place it at the back of my head. I told her to dominate and use me til she was done dahil never pa siya nag-cum.

She teased me and used me to her desires to the point sinusunod ko lahat at ung commands na kainin siya the way she likes it. I let her lick/suck/kiss me aggressively to the point I got a lot of marks. She's really great! Kahit nilabasan na ko, sumasaludo ulit dahil ineexplote niya ung mga tickle spots ko to the point nakakalibog na ulit. Dila at subo pa lang un folks!

When she told me she's really fucking wet, she looked at my eyes like she really wants to be fucked. Kaso ramdam ko she's holding back. She went on top na parang she's slowly becoming stiff at naiilang na sakin. She grinded me without penetration but with hesitation - eventually she told me that she can't do it. She started to be teary eyed and keep on apologizing.

Edi inalis ng kuya mo ung pagkakatali niya sa kamay ko and sitted down to comfort her. I asked her what's wrong but she's bursting into tears and asked me if I can give her time to fix her self inside the CR. I told her to go on and I will wait. Alam kong mabigat un dahil ramdam at kita ko sa mga mata niyang natakot siya at talagang maiging nag-lock ng CR.

Nakahiga lang ako for the next 30 minutes wondering what went wrong. Hindi ko din maintindihan bakit pero ang alam ko lang galing siya sa religious family. Kinabahan din ako noon dahil baka mapabugbog ako nito o kaya sampahan ako ng kasong sexual abuse.

Eventually, lumabas din siya. First time ko maappreciate ung tunog ng na-unlocked at nabuksan na pinto in my entire life. Slowly siyang lumabas as if she's checking if I'm still in the room. Noong nakita niya ako, parang siyang napangiting bata na lumapit sayo after magtampo.

She hugged me tight and told me she thought I'll leave her dahil sa pagiging emotional niya at the height of our foreplay. Nanlambot puso, as in it melted, pinagkatiwala na pala niya sarili niya sakin at her most vulnerable moment. 

I comforted her and eventually kwinento niya in full detail ung life at sex life niya. It's a tough life story tho! From religious family na may mataas na expectations, siraulong exes at fubu's gusto-gustong dinedegrade siya without her consent, at mababang pagtingin sa sarili despite the looks, body, career, and opportunities at her hand.

Naging instant crying shoulder ako and I did my best to listen and take care of her plus bring back the fun again with a promise that its her time to be the star in bed. 

We eventually do the deed ng siya ang dominante! She really knows her gameplay to satisfy a guy pero first time niyang masatisfy sa cowgirl at makaramdam ng feeling of orgasm. I can see and feel it dahil napabaon kuko niya sakin habang tumitirik at napapaliyad siya sa sarap with a really weird feels na parang may nagleleak sayong fluid mula sa kanyang pussy.

She became a bit selfish and used me to satisfy her desires from edging, fuck in front of the mirror, at continuous BJ kahit nilabas mo na lahat sa bibig niya.

She was really happy dahil gigil siya even during after care namin. First time ko makitang gumaan aura niya at palambing sabihin thankful siya sakin dahil I made her cum multiple times on the first run!

TAKE AWAY: Mahaba na ang kwento ko AJ! But at the end of the day, even though there are no morals in love, sex, and seduction, still there has to be certain amout of respect, peace of mind, and comfort on it. With or without strings attached, never be selfish - please them til they cum, dominate without overstepping, and give an aftercare that will make them feel human again instead of leaving them with feelings of guilt and emptiness.

Truly a cheerful giver will always be blessed on a thousandfold, whether in bed or in life!

Stay safe out there!",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/zvbdgz/umiyak_before_fuck/,t2_rjs991vb,2022-12-26 09:05:31,40
End of Control,"Before I decided to step away from a life I used to think is good for me, it became deceitfully destructive as days and months went by. To anyone who experienced or is still in a controlling relationship, men or women alike, I’d like to give my own piece of advice to help you realise you aren’t alone and there’s still hope to get out of there, quick. Once you feel these types of signs, do yourself a favor and run. like. the. wind.

1. Ignoring the obvious red flags.

“This person keeps on staying in touch with me all day everyday and is very engaged in everything that’s been happening to me. That’s really sweet!” It is at first, until it isn’t.

Don’t fall for the endless showering of attention, it will backfire on you soon enough and drown you like you have never seen yourself before. When they get your full love and trust, they will use this later on to chip away your self esteem, so you will think very low of yourself.

Healthy partnership would still make you feel you can do things on your own without worrying about someone else’s —especially your partner’s judgments.

2. Being told where to go, who to talk to or even what you should wear.

A little jealousy isn’t so bad. Afterall we all feel jealous sometimes. It goes above the acceptable means when they isolate you from people or ideas they feel closely threatened, and instead of focusing on resolving their own weaknesses within themselves, they will go the easy way out by projecting their messy feelings onto you and make you feel like it’s totally you who caused it.

This usually starts with a habit of seeing yourself getting cornered to follow their wishes, so that you keep the relationship happy. If you chose not to, they will see you as the villain and they will make sure you feel it thoroughly every chance they get.

They will make you feel guilty when they can’t get themselves to feel better. You will be blamed responsible on everything that might cause them to feel off, eventhough you shouldn’t be held accountable for their inability to manage their own demons.

3. Calling you names, labeling you in a degrading way and speaking to you using extremely profane language when an argument ensues.

I have never, ever, ever thought I would allow any person to do this in my life, but it happened. When you love someone, you trust them with all your heart, until you become too caught up with the addicitive feeling of being inlove; and then disagreements happen and you see their true colors they’ve never (or purposely haven’t) shown you before.

“Maybe it’s just for today’s major fight”

“Maybe it’s really my fault so the reaction went too far”

“Maybe this person will change and come to realize this is destroying us“

Months, and months have gone and nothing. Absolutely nothing has changed. I would cry out of the blue, feeling disgusted with myself wherever I may be, because the abusive words and emotional turmoil it caused replay on my head a hundred to a thousand times over.

When it was all over, I couldn’t be any more free. It was so fucking hard to leave and it might take me a very long time to fully heal, but I am glad to have taken that brave first step, to realize my worth and cement on the ground that no one, absolutely no one deserves to put up with a controlling partner at any given circumstance.

I hope I helped someone today, it’s hard to open up your encounters with abuse because it feels embarrassing to let people know you have subjected yourself in this torturous situation.

Victims of controlling relationships usually deal with it quietly alone, and I hope this encourages you to walk away from something utterly unhealthy.

If you are in the same situation right now, seek support, tell someone dear to you about it. It’s crucial that you get reminded how much you are loved and cared for.

Choosing between two women,"Hi r/alasjuicy. You can call me Jay (not my real name) 26M. I am in an LD relationship for 3 years. Only 1 year actually being together. My girlfriend (lets call her Mary) is a career woman. She believes in equality among all things. She would barf at the idea of being a housewife. She earns more than me and is not afraid to fight to get what she wants. You know, a typical modern feminist woman. Not surprisingly, she is not looking forward to form a family. She's prioritizing her career first than our relationship. Our 3 years LDR may soon become a 5 year ordeal--continuous. Mary and I are very much synced. I dont get bored talking to her. She gets me intellectually stimulated. She gets me to improve but our sex life has been rocky even whenever we meet. I don't feel anything. It's like putting my penis in a glass of lukewarm water. Did I mention she's cold and not that caring of a woman?

Because of unfulfilled sexual needs (Yes i know. I am an asshole for doing this), I signed up to Tinder. There, I met Jane. Jane is not as academically impressive as Mary. She did not finish college nor does she have latin honor since elementary school. She is not a strong woman. She is someone you would want to protect because she cries easily but it doesn't mean she's weak. She is strong in her own way. She's a very hard worker. From dawn to dusk, she would work. Doing housework here, knitting or crocheting there to sell. She would try her best to please you (in all aspects, not in bed only. She is very good in bed. Best I've ever had). She would loose weight because she wants to look good for you, she would wake up early morning to go out and see you, etc.. She's someone who would devote herself for her family. She is not as smart as Mary nor is she as talented, but she devotes herself 200% to her family. She is warm and supportive. But I found myself not interested with our talks nor am I intellectually stimulated. She also has the tendency to lie as coping mechanism for her abusive family. She lied to me she was using birth control pills, when she actually didn't. She wont communicate her feelings until such time they would explode. She is also clingy. I felt like her world revolved around me and it was suffocating. She is sickly and is not close to her family. I worry all the time at her health especially since she always gets undiagnosed abdominal pain. She has no insurance and earns only a very small amount. 

Truth be told. I am a shitty guy. I cheated on Mary with Jane. Mary intellectually stimulates me but I am low on physical attraction and I am not sexually satisfied. She's pretty but has masculine features like broad shoulder (etc). She is fence sitting on having a family because it may slow down her career and dreams. There are times I wanted to end our relationship because she always reiterate that her priority is her career in the near future. I want to have a family and she knows it. I am hesitant giving up my time with Mary because we've spent time and invested emotions together for 3 years already.

Jane is not as smart, poor, no degree but working on it, has daddy issues, weak and sickly but she would treat you like a KING. She would care for you (and her children) at the best of her ability. She is an 8/10 and the sex is the best that I've ever had. But ultimately I get bored talking with her. In this economy, I believe of two income household. I already ended my sneaky relationship to her in favor of Mary. I was forced to say bad and cruel things so that she may hate me to easily move on.

Who would you choose if you were me? Mary or Jane

When all the world seemed right Part 4.,"She *was* the love of my life. We just had a wonderful weekend trip out.

[Part 1 here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/hq5v69/when_all_the_world_seemed_right_part_1/)

[Part 2 here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/hq8ijx/when_all_the_world_seemed_right_part_2/)

[Part 3 here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/hrf93v/when_all_the_world_seemed_right_part_3/)

Fast forward to the weekend capping off two more blissful weeks. We were at the wedding reception of one of her office mates. Part of the programme involved having the guests dance and I'd never danced with her before (not that I'm a particularly good dancer but hey) so I asked her if she would like to. She simply smiled and took my hand.

We danced, I don't remember the music or what we were doing exactly but it seemed like we got lost in each other. We were talking to each other the whole time and it felt like everything simply faded away and it was just the two of us on the dance floor. I wouldn't even be able to remember the music as I was so lost in the moment and in her, the smell of her hair, the sound of her voice, the warmth of her body pressed against mine.

Apparently that part of the program was done and people were beginning to sit down. We were one of the last to do so.

I think it was her manager that inquired about our friendship or status. We were holding hands and I looked to her for an answer because up to that point we really hadn't put a label on us. (we discussed it and we were fine with that) We were holding hands under the table and she raised that hand to show it, declaring ""We're best friends.""

The manager and his wife smiled at us, both of them were grey-haired already but seemingly very happy in life (they were also one of the last to sit down after the dance, apparently)

""I married my best friend--"" He declared ""-- best decision I've ever made. Good on you both."" and they kissed, much like the way she and I had been kissing each other at that event.

The rest of the night went on as you would expect and we eventually went home. No fun stuff, sadly, as it was really late and we came from out of town, plus we had work the next day.

She was quiet on communications for the rest of the week, which was not out of the ordinary since we were both busy with our respective things. I only started to worry when the weekend went by and I didn't hear from her until the weekend.

We had dinner out and she didn't seem her usual bubbly self, but I was patient and figured she would tell me in time. We talked about work, and what had been happening. I told her I had made the dean's list at school etc. (we met in college but I didn't finish from the same college since I transferred to a different one she was working and I was finishing up a few units)

She was quiet (a thoughtful kind of quiet) on the way home and when I dropped her off, I leaned in to give her a kiss, which she refused. It hurt. I asked what was wrong but she couldn't tell me. She said she needed to think.

I receive a text on Friday night, the week after. ""We need to talk, are you free tomorrow?"" By this time, I was hurting and quite emotional but I kept the emotions in check and met with her.

The gist of what she told me was that:

* Everything was perfect, even down to the things I say, which scared her. (I think what her manager said was the trigger)
* She's not ready to settle down into something like that.

She didn't want to continue and wanted to go back to being best friends.

The rest of the reasons she gave were, I think, added in an attempt to soften the blow because she knew how smitten I was with her by this point but those reasons, I will not list, did not make it hurt any less.

Things went from color to grey. Sun to rain (literally in some instances) and friends noticed I was not my usual happy self.

My friends, of course, sided with me. Some of hers did too. But there was no fight, there was no game, there was no anything. We took our space and let each other heal.

Eventually we started talking again and went back to being best friends. The pain was still there, she knew it, and probably felt it too, but we both worked at it and eventually it dulled.

We started seeing other people and found ourselves with partners. At one point I had to rescue her from her partner because he was being abusive. This put a strain on my relationship because my girlfriend at the time thought that if she asked me to jump, I would ask ""How high."" 

She didn't understand that this was my best friend we were talking about.

We became single again eventually and had two more bedroom encounters. One was when we had dinner and another was when I helped her finish painting her new condo. The sex was great, though I was kinda out of shape by that point because work took its toll. I guarded my emotions. I was waiting for her to say something, anything, about going back to the way we were. My heart would have leapt.

But she didn't say anything and we eventually drifted back into being best friends.

A year down the line and I helped her find work at this new company where I was employed. Pay was good and things looked great until shit happened with the company and I was forced to resign. No strain on our friendship, though I was having a rough time and when I reached out to talk, she was unavailable.

We drifted further apart.

She's now in Spain, we met recently and talked and it was like old times catching up and we compared our experiences over the years, which, strangely, were very similar. Part of me hoped she'd say something, but she didn't.

If she reached out to me and said something now, I'd go with her in a heartbeat.

If she reached out to me and said something now, I wouldn't.

I don't know. The pain is still there when I think about it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/i4lu9l/when_all_the_world_seemed_right_part_4/,t2_6m6huspc,2020-08-06 13:24:29,8
"""The high contrast of things made very little pleasure--bliss."" PART 2/2","L
**TW: Some of the next parts depict aggressive behavior, sadism, masochism, and it may be considered as verbal and physical abuse.**


He drove really fast and he kept on honking. He really wanted to go home faster.


I touched his skin and I just noticed he felt warmer than usual, he's been drinking.


In a little less than an hour, we were at his place.


Stuff were broken, and it was such a mess. Whiskey bottles empty in the kitchen sink. A box of pizza with just crusts left behind.


I got scared. He pulled me to his room upstairs and then he told me that he was worried that I may be with some other guy.


*""Tangina. Akala ko may kasama ka nang iba e.""*


It was because I wasn't picking up that he decided to go to school. I told him I needed to rest. I apologized because maybe he's furious because it was my fault. That I neglected him for a bit. (*gaslighted into guilt*)

I told him that we should just take a shower just so we can go and sleep.

*""Mk was just a friend.""* I reiterated.

He then started shouting at me, I shouted back.
All because he didn't believe me.
He thought I was being defensive.
. He grabbed me, I struggled to get away.
He cursed at me, I screamed at his face.


He was furious, aggressive, you can see he was a different person.
And I then being so tired, I just broke down and cried.


He pulled me up. Kissed me. Apologized. The vicious cycle went around again.


*""Shower tayo. Palamig ulo.""* he said.


So we were in the shower, and he decided to ""punish"" me.


I was nearer to the shower and he was behind me. He got some soap and lathered the soap on me, and onto his body. I tried turning around and he didn't let me.

*""Bakit di ako pwede tumingin?""* I asked him why he won't let me turn around.

*""What the fuck? I told you, I'd punish you. Wag ka lilingon.""*

I was hearing him moan. Fapping. His left hand touching my body. His right, vigorously stroking his cock.

*""Fuck. I'm so hard. Even my cock is angry as fuck.""*

I hear him fapping, his moans getting louder. His body getting closer to me. I felt him get even warmer than earlier. He grabbed my left tit and held on to it tight.

*""Lalabasan na ko. Fuck. I'm cumming.""*  I felt his warm tongue lick my back. And then I felt his hot cum hit my skin.

His cock was rubbing on to my ass cheek while he came.

It was a lot. I didn't know what to do or how to feel since he's not letting me turn around.

He then touched my hair, fixed it to one side, ran his fingers through my hair on the back of my head,  and he grabbed a fistful.

He then shoved my face into the cold wall, my head hit the wall hard, but it was tolerable, and he lifted one of my legs and shoved his cock inside me. He fucked me hard under the cold shower, staring into my face while my cheek was squished in between his veiny hand and the cold wall.

*""I don't get why you have to talk to other guys. Ain't you getting enough cock here?""*

*""Di ba enough? Hindi ba sapat?!""* as he thrusted harder and harder.

It was scary but I was in a trance. His hard cock was inside me all the time, my body was sore, but I was fed. I was stuffed. I was full.

He fucked me really fast, but he suddenly stopped. Turned me around. Turned the shower off. Took a towel from the rack and patted himself dry.

*""Come to bed.""* he said as he walked out of the bathroom, naked with his cock still hard.

I got out of the shower, got my towel, patted myself dry and went to bed.

*""Tuwad.""* stroking his cock while he coldly asked me to bend over.

He spanked me hard on both ass cheeks. Too hard it stung. Spat on my pussy, ate me while I was bent over.

*""Is my mouth not enough?""* he asked while he took breaks from eating me. Spanked my ass and ate me again.

I couldn't bear it, I can't answer it was all too good. My silence fueled his anger more. He pulled me up, cleared a table, broke a glass and a bottle. Made me bend over on that table and fucked me there.

The mess scared me but it didn't stop me from getting wet. He was too into the fucking he didn't mind he was stepping on broken glass. The pain from it made him fuck me more.

*""Fffuuccckkk""* I knew he was hurt but that didn't stop him.

The room filled with our grunting and moaning.


*Puro mura yung narinig ko sa bibig n'ya.*


He was bleeding and he didn't care.

It's taking time for him to finish since he came a lot in the shower. When he was about to cum, he pulled me up, made me lie down on the bed, he put his bleeding foot on the bed, and as I stare at it, he fucked me harder, grabbed my face, spat in my mouth and we came together.

He then fell into me, all pale, and I checked up on him. He was losing a significant amount of blood and I had to do something.

I pushed him off of me to roll into the bed,  and ran to find his kit and I immediately applied first aid. I wrapped his foot up after cleaning it but he was still bleeding.

He was pale. He was a bit lethargic. I got scared.


I got scared because people might think something really bad happened. Since I'm all bruised up too. I almost had a panic attack.


I didn't call anyone. I've composed myself.


Breathing in and out until I found clarity.

I've unwrapped his foot. Took it down from being elevated.

I cleaned this foot, disinfected it, saw he needed stitches and I had no choice, I flipped his place over and I was able to find sutures. He was drunk, no amount of anesthesia would work (and there weren't any there anyway). I stitched him up. Wrapped his foot again.

All this while I was buttnaked.


I found myself stuck standing next to the bed.


Tired. Emotionally, physically.
Hurt. Emotionally, physically.


Then I lied down next to him. He was sleeping.


I turned my head and  stared at him. Then I got up just to be sure. Got my things.


Checked his BP, his pulse. He was alright.


I wore one of this shirts.


Cleaned up. And just sat on a chair after everything.


He was knocked out. I was watching him sleep.


I rested for a bit, I lied next to him in bed. Listening to him snore as I stared at the ceiling.


I stood up, wrote a long ass letter, left it next to him.
Told him why I left him alone.


Took a shower, cried. Dressed up and left.

**At that point I realized how angry sex was both delicious and dangerous. I've had angry sex in the next few relationships, but this was the worst. It just felt good because there was nothing good to come out of it. The high contrast of things made very little pleasure--bliss.**

*It was like uni. Surrounded by danger, yet it was decadent and too mind-blowing to just forget.*


PS. He never reached out to me after. I just saw him recently after two decades  with his family, that's why I decided to share this story.",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/129dzhe/the_high_contrast_of_things_made_very_little/,t2_ixqbp61r,2023-04-02 15:41:38,7
[Primer] Tita Subby Explains Consent in English,"*EDIT:* *I totally forgot, but sending people nudes or engaging in sexting is a sexual act, even if it doesn't involve physical contact. So to the assholes who sent me unsolicited dick pics, you are major consent violators. I never consented to seeing your tiny dicks on my phone screen without any hello or preamble whatsoever.*

---

*Crossposting from [r/phbdsmgonewild](https://www.reddit.com/r/phbdsmgonewild/comments/eesrwx/primer_tita_subby_explains_consent_in_english/) with permission*.

**Also, Merry Christmas, pervs.**

---

Engaging in any sexual activity, however casual or transactional in nature, requires consent between both (or if you're frisky, more than two) parties.

What's consent basically? **Consent**, in general, is *permission for something to happen or agreement to do something*. In our case, we'll be focusing on discussing *sexual consent*.

Also, everything below is applicable to *all genders and all power dynamics*. In this case we're used to the hetero guys asking the girls to do stuff, and the girls thinking about it and saying yes. It's the 21st century, let's all be responsible and make consent our priority.

### Why is getting someone's consent before sexy time so important to us?

* **Basic human decency and respect** - As human beings, we have freedom of will to choose. When it comes to sex, which is very intimate, personal, and risky, people should be able to decide for themselves if they want it, with whom they want it, when they want it, how they want it, you get the drill. We respect people's agency, autonomy and boundaries.

* **Mutual enjoyment** - Sex is infinitely more enjoyable when everyone is enthusiastic about it, excited about it, and committed to having fun! You can only have that if everyone's on board.

* **Awareness of liability** - I wish I didn't have to emphasize it, but we don't want to violate anyone's freedom of choice when it comes to having sex. Any other way runs the risk of regret up to sexual assault or even rape.

### FRIES Model of Consent

[Planned Parenthood](https://plannedparenthood.tumblr.com/post/148506806862/understanding-consent-is-as-easy-as-fries-consent) (a sexual health organization in the US) released primers on consent using the FRIES acronym. Really tasty and catchy. So what does FRIES mean?

* **Freely given.** Consenting is a choice you make without pressure, manipulation, or under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Even if you're being paid for sex, you can say no and return the money if you feel you're unsafe, or you just don't feel like doing the deed.

* **Reversible.** Anyone can change their mind about what they feel like doing, anytime. Even if you’ve done it before, and even if you’re both naked in bed. Even if you're married. Even if you just feel like farting and now it's all unsexy. They should tell their partner to slow down or stop.

* **Informed.** You can only consent to something if you have the full story. For example, if someone says they’ll use a condom and then they don’t, there isn’t full consent. If someone wants to do bondage, and you both don't know how to do it or what the risks are, you could get hurt instead of getting any pleasure.

* **Enthusiastic.** When it comes to sex, you should only do stuff you WANT to do, not things that you feel you’re expected to do. Even as a partner (in a marriage or long term relationship), none of us are expected to put out for sex. Of course, healthy sex is almost always part of a healthy relationship, but it shouldn't be a chore if you don't feel like it. If you have issues with your libido, or you feel you are too tired, talk it out with your partner and get proper help. Or, in case you're just not sexually compatible, discuss it like adults and find a solution that works for you.

* **Specific.** Saying yes to one thing (like going to the bedroom to make out) doesn’t mean you’ve said yes to others (like having sex). This is especially important in BDSM where a lot of the kinks are very specific and risky. If I consent to being spanked with an open hand it doesn't mean I want to be spanked with a crop. I fucking hate stingy pain, but really, I don't need a reason.

### Responsibilities of a Partner (Asker)

*Asker - the person doing the asking.*

1. **Check to see if you or your partner are in the right frame of mind to consent.** Right frame of mind means someone is in a good physical condition and of clear mind to make decisions. They aren't intoxicated, emotional, or desperate. Intoxication is an iffy subject, since a lot of people use this as an excuse to regret what they did the next day. Own your decisions, make them sober if you can.

1. **Be informed and prepared** - This means, before engaging in any sexual activity, make sure you are informed of the advantages and risks. It ranges from knowing basic sexual safety like how babies are made, how to wear condoms to protect from STDs, how to test for pregnancy, how to check for STDs, and what is proper consent. If you can't grok this basic shit, why do you think you should be able to choke someone with its risk of permanent injury of death? And please, buy your own fucking condoms.

1. **Explicitly ask for consent** before having sex or engaging in other physical or sexual activities (light touching to BDSM included). When I say explicitly, spell it out. *""Pwede ba ako pumasok sa kwarto mo?""* **NOT EQUAL TO** *""Pwede ka ba kantutin?""* Don't ever assume as the askee or the asker.  We are all adults, fuck euphemisms. Strive for clarity.

1. **Ensure that consent is ongoing and enthusiastic.** Watch for their reaction. If you suspect they're fake orgasming, ask them. The least damage will be you're awful at sex and they're not enjoying it, the worst will be they feel they're being forced and don't really want it. When in doubt, ask. *""Shet, babe, sarap ko ba kumantot?"" ""Hmm, idk.""*
 
1. **Respect safewords and boundaries.** A simple NO would suffice to stop any action, but *RED* or *pangolin* is a good one too. If they say you shouldn't grab their hair, don't. If you're not sure if slapping their butt would be pleasurable to them, ask.

### Responsibilities of a Partner (Askee)

*Askee - the person expected to answer yes or no.*

1. **Ensure you are in the right frame of mind to consent.** If you have any issues, regrets, fears, anything that stops you from saying yes enthusiastically, stop and say so. You think you're too tired? Too drunk? Too depressed? Too manic? Too horny? If it precludes you from making safe decisions, stop. You don't even owe anyone an explanation. **A no is a NO.**

1. **Be informed and prepared** - Same as the asker, you should also be equally informed of what they ask you to do. If you're going to be tied, it doesn't mean that you should put your entire trust on your rigger. Know at least the basic ties, risks, eventualities. Also, buy your own condoms. I hate to be misogynistic, but having it happen several times, some guys will do anything to get out of using protection. Better yet, don't fuck a guy with this attitude, he can go have blue balls.

1. **Be firm with your boundaries**. Think about what you want and you don't want done. Doesn't matter how trivial it is. If you don't like getting your ass grabbed, say so. If you don't like bareback sex, say so. Boundaries are there to keep you safe.

1. **Be communicative. PEOPLE ARE NOT MIND READERS.** Say what you want and you don't want. If you can't assert yourself during negotiation and sex, you aren't mature enough to be engaging in it.

1. **Don't manipulate people.** One game is denying someone initially yet acquiescing after several attempts, because apparently saying yes the first time isn't proper because it makes you *easy*. This is bullshit and just sends confusing signals to people. Be clear and don't play childish games.

### Examples of Consent Violations

I kind of regret that I have to list this here, but after seeing several real-life examples from previous encounters and other Redditors, I've come to the conclusion that I have to emphasize this to everyone.

* **Physical force** - This is self explanatory. This assumes that your partner didn't consent to rape play or the like. BDSM is not an excuse for rape and only an abuser will think like that. High risk scenes are almost always negotiated and consensual. Any issue with your partner, she can stop (almost) anytime, and an experienced Dom will be prepared for that eventuality (quick release someone).

* **Dishonesty** - Tricking your partner into doing something they wouldn't do otherwise if informed properly. I've personally encountered several guys who would contact me for threesomes with their girlfriends. Upon being asked whether I could communicated directly with their partner, they would refuse, saying that they hadn't told her yet. One guy even told me, ""She'd say no when you ask her, but when she's in the bedroom with us, she'll do it. She's done it before."" This is disgusting behavior.

* **Unwarranted persistence** - *Tangina mo 'wag ka makulit.* Repeatedly cajoling someone into having sex expecting they would crumble under your persistence is NOT proper consent. If someone is so exhausted from fighting you, their yes is simply capitulation out of tiredness. It is not freely made nor enthusiastic. There's a local culture of toughing it out and hanging on when the object of your affection isn't reciprocating. That's not romantic, that's fucking creepy.

* **Assumptions** - Assuming that I make out with you means I'll agree to fucking you without being asked, is a consent violation. People have specific limits for specific tasks. If in doubt, ask.

### Consent and BDSM

Some people may be confused about the entire part of asking about consent when in a BDSM session or relationship. Isn't it the entire point of being a Dom and a sub is because the Dom has the power and the sub has to obey explicitly, even if they don't want to?

In fact, consent is one of the foundations of BDSM. Even with extreme plays such as rape kink / Consensual Non Consent, where a ""No"" may not stop the play, proper Doms (and participative subs) take steps to ensure everyone is on board and enjoying it.

The entire scope of it will be covered in future posts, especially when it comes to D/s relationships and negotiation. Let is suffice here that safewords are a measure of respect for both sides of the slash, regardless of how extreme you play. Everyone has limits, and to disregard them is to be unrealistic and abusive.

### Conclusion

*But asking for consent isn't sexy!* Some might say. Boner killer *daw* if someone asks you formally, *""May I touch your cock and suck it? Or should I just give you a handjob?""* Of course there are ways to phrase everything in such a way that it's still really hot, but clear and specific. You could discuss everything beforehand (and feel really aroused while you enumerate all the acts that they could do to you and vice versa): this is called **negotiation**. And to be honest, what's sexier than someone being an adult about fucking and taking charge of their safety and pleasure?

Consent is even applicable in non-sexual areas of our lives, anything that requires us making decisions affecting ourselves. As responsible adults, we should always be looking for our partner's enthusiastic yes to fucking! There's really nothing unsexier than a starfish, or worse, abuse. Let's make this a standard on PH Reddit and stop the abusive behavior we all hear about or even experience.

"If you're too shy, Let me know...","A.K.A. ""The Time I Tried Being A Sub And I Fucking Hate It.""  
A.K.A. ""The Time Matty Healy Wrote A Song About Voyeurism And I Felt Heard.""

This was around the same time, back in 2021 at the height of COVID. I was living alone in my apartment back in Makati, and didn't have any one to talk to. My family insisted I spend the entire lockdown at my place, since our driver had covid and no one could pick me up.

I posted back then in r/phr4r using another account (we all have that kalat account) asking for some online intimacy. sure enough, someone interesting caught my eye.

""So what's your take on women having unfair treatment across all industries?"" was her way of saying ""hello"".

""I think it's obvious. And just like any other major problem in the world, Wala tayo magagawa unless someone who ACTUALLY has power does something about it."" I replied.

""Spoken like a true trash."" she replied.

*uhm, first of all what the fuck?*

My conversation with Bea (not her real name) was like this. Every. Damn. Day.

She had her own version of the world, and in it, she felt abused, mistreated by men. I, as a heterosexual guy, had no qualms or any valid opinions about it, but I just let her rant most of the time. During video calls when she would want a visual representation of my reaction, I just tried not to look at her boobs when she talked, Trying not to give her another reason to complain about. I know it's not intentional, but whenever we facetime-d, she always wore a tanktop, or fit shirts or something that would accentuate her beautiful chest. Don't even get me started on days when it got really hot and sweaty (tangina bakit kasi ang init sa Manila?). 

She always had something to complain about. Her coworkers that talk behind her back (guys who are a word or a shoulder touch away from a trip to the HR). The ""kalye"" dudes cat calling her, despite being seen from just her window. Everything that irritates her seemed to have one or two men involved, nothing more.

*Why I even bother, you ask?*

After exchanging messages for a week, things got weird. Like the good kind of weird. I think? Idk, bahala na kayo magdecide lol

Ay sorry, for context pala, she looked like Joyce Pring.

G? ok G.

in the midst of a boring ""could have been an email"" zoom meeting i had with work, she sent me a message.

""i'm gonna let you jack off to me tonight.""

""I'm in a meeting."" I replied, disinterested. My attention (however dwindling and decaying from the meeting) was pivoting towards my bed, and my recently purchased linen spray (gamechanger, btw. sarap lagi tulog ko).

""I don't care. I'm calling in 5 minutes. Start stroking."" she said. *this bitch.*

I sighed, but started caressing my dick. 

Five minutes later, she was calling me.

*Holy Shit* was all I could breathe out.

She was sitting in her usual chair, both legs up, her pussy unshaved and showing. she was licking one finger and the other hand was caressing her right boob. 

""Show me your dick."" Bea said.

""I told you I'm in a meeting."" I replied, I could feel my dick being woken up.

""Bakit ba ang hirap mo makaintindi? Bobo ka ba? I said show me your dick."" 

I felt the *pang* of my ""so called"" ego being hit, like the sound of a church bell ringing in my head.

I put my phone down closer to my pajamas.

""I won't take it out unless you beg for it."" I said, trying to sound dom when I knew this was a losing fight.

""You don't get to order me around. Do it or i'll block you right now.""

I felt hot. I was starting to really get pissed.

But then my dick started taking over, and did as she's told.

""oh, diba? susunod ka din pala eh. manyakis.""

*Don't do it, man. Don't do it. Just let her be. Just let her have her way this one time.*

""What else do you want me to do?"" I said, I felt like one of those characters in a movie just letting the villain have their way. 

""Stroke it for me."" She said. I could feel her dominance start to tone down. She was already moaning at this point. So I did as I was told.

""Any questions from (my department)?""

*FUCK I FORGOT I'M IN A MEETING.*

""N-none po for me."" instinctively, I said. Thank God cameras were allowed to be off at this stupid shit of a meeting, as with microphones on mute the entire time.

""You're in a meeting but you're jerking off to some woman? Can't help being a man talaga no?"" She said, moaning.

*You crazy bitch you're in this as much as I am.*

""You like this? You enjoy yourself jan? ha? oohhh......f-fuck..."" She said.

I wanted so bad to command her, To tell her to just say ""please"" kahit *please* lang. Want this as much as I do, Bea. But no, she kept fingering herself until she finished.

""Tagal mo mag cum ah. Napapangitan ka ba sakin? ha?"" She taunted, while rubbing her body and sticking her tongue out at the same time. She was doing that Ahegao face that until that day, didn't realize was a kink of mine. 

""Don't cum until I tell you to. Understand? Your dick is mine."" 

She stopped pleasuring herself and got up. She wore her sando and underwear and sat back up, arms folded under her boobs, watching me aimlessly jerk off.

""I'm almost there."" I said. Fuck I wanted to cum so bad, But I couldn't. *Tangina talaga.*

""How bad do you wanna cum for me?"" 

""Very. Very bad.""

""Are you my pathetic slave?""

I paused. I couldn't even fake a *yes.*

""sagot. or i'll block you.""

""oo."" I said. Feeling a rush of emotions sweep me as I completely lost all control.

""Oo what?""

""I'm your pathetic slave.""

""Good. now cum. right....NOW.""

""say ple-""

""RIGHT. NOW.""

""TANGINA!""

I came. 

It was like a dam broke and all relief suddenly started gushing out of my dick. My shaft, and my balls were pulsating like crazy, and possibly, even my soul.

I hated her for doing that, but at the same time, It was a release unlike any other I've ever had.

I slept like a baby that night.

The next morning, There was a new message from Bea.

""Videocall tayo later. Don't wear anything.""

*Why am I even okay with this!?*

I let the thought simmer in my head. While I was making coffee, I kept trying to rationalize what she was trying to make me do. I liked sex, I enjoyed voyeurism, but... Is all of this still acceptable? 

After I got showered and properly dried myself, I messaged her saying ""G?""

""G."" she said. 

I opened facetime, tapped on Bea, and hit ""Facetime Call.""

What happened next was the most terrifying thing I have ever experienced.

""Hiiii!!"" Bea said. 

She was in a random Mcdonald's, all by herself. She had a facemask and face shield on, but I knew those eyes were Bea's.

""Asan ka?"" I asked trying to make sense of what was happening. 

In my head, I thought it was another round of ""slut shame Tom"" where we'd both be naked. That she would start degrading me then and there, while she came from the very words she'd speak out of that dirty mouth. That she would control when I could cum and not. But apparently, it was something else.

""Talk to me while I wait for my mom."" she said, while browsing through her iPad.

""Why in the fuck do I have to be naked?"" I said.

""Because I want to."" she said, trying to sound cute and innocent.

*This woman, I swear to God.*

I tried asking more questions, about why the need to be bare, because during this time, we never talked about anything that could give me a boner, but she just brushed it off and changed the topic. Her face mask/shield and her red sweater wasn't helping either. every part of her body was covered, even her legs (she was wearing a pair of boyfriend denim pants). Not that I have feet fetish (and not shaming those that do. Go lang mga pre/sismars) but she was wearing boots.

We just talked like normal people. For a brief moment, she was a ""person"" void of any traumas or hate against men. She told me the kind of movies she's seen, the music she listens to(which apparently, we have A LOT in common). Nakakatawa, but for that time i got to know that version of Bea, I forgot I was naked lol.

half an hour later, her mom arrived. She bid me goodbye and dropped the call.

I tried to make up for the entire time I was naked by trying to fap to her, but nothing. na-da. her whole ensemble was just not at all pleasing, sexually.

Few hours later, as I was about to call it another defeat, she sent me a video on iMessage.

It was a video of her room. at first, the frame was centered on her empty ergo chair, but then she stepped in, with the same clothes that she wore a few hours ago. She put down her bag, removed her face mask and shield, and started undressing.

When her clothes were finally off, she started licking her fingers, and started fingering herself.

""Ohh....fuck, Tom....ang sarap mo."" She said.

*What the actual fuck? Is she being submissive now?*

Okay I listen to a lot of music. Most genres, I appreciate, like Acid Pop, Metal, 80's, 90's you name it. On days when I need to focus on something, I listen to classical music too.

And when I heard what she said next, It felt like hearing the second movement of Sinfonietta I, Allegretto by Leoš Janáček (1Q89 readers will know).

""Please, Tom? Please fuck me. Sige na. mmnhh. Good girl ako for you oohhffuck....fuck just...please? mmnnhh....aahh..shit ang sarap mo....nnhh...."" 

Her face had that sour look when you lick a lemon for the first time. She was in so much pleasure it painted a bitter look on her face. Like she knows this feeling wouldn't last, and that it would be over by the time she finishes. Her lips tried not to part, biting her lower lip trying not to sound like she was lacking all control. But eventually, she let out a loud moan. A shout of relief into the void, as her body twitches and her legs and arms relaxed on her ergo chair.

Panting, her gaze was fixed on the ceiling, her stare was blank like she couldn't believe what she did. And then slowly, she looked at the camera, gave me a smile and the video ended.

After my 4th time jerking off to the video, I was exhausted. A smile started to come out of my lips.

*I fucking win.*

We stopped talking eventually. I think she thought I ghosted her when I had to return back to the province, since my attention for the duration of 2021 was spent back at my province, tending to my sick relatives and friends, checking up on them one by one everyday (virtually) making sure they're not dead. I also wanted a break from her mental torture, because I started questioning things after what happened and during those few weeks that we talked, I felt pleasure, sure, but it was emotionally draining to not have any control like that. I just woke up one day and there were no messages asking me to do weird shit or another finger video (which for obvious reasons, i deleted everything already.) and before I knew it, her reddit profile was deactivated. Same goes for her mobile number (some company owns it now) and her Telegram account.

As always, thanks for reading! I don't have that many crazy experiences (or at least the ones na I could share) but yeah hope you liked this as much as you did with what I previously wrote. :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/196okqa/if_youre_too_shy_let_me_know/,t2_5ry4u9y,2024-01-15 03:57:12,20
I’m dating the girl of my dreams without realizing it.,"  
Scroll down until ‘SKIP HERE’ to skip into the juicy part

  
  
I (24m) know the title doesn’t sound like something you’ll read here but stick with me, papunta pa tayo sa exciting na part.

  
  
I met her (21F) during my review for my licensure exam (Oo, tapang no? Pinagsabay landi and review), we started on casual relationship, aminado siya that she was emotionally invested first in our set up but ako naman super completely denial with my feelings for her and kasi nga review, I grew up in a family and environment na parang katapusan na ng mundo kapag bumagsak ka. During my review I kept telling myself na babawe ako sa kanya, I kept that promise, even before we were official.

  
  
During start ng review ko I admit that I was only there for the pleasure, if it doesn’t work out, balik ulit sa yellow app, collect and select, just like my past casual set ups during my thesis in college, BUT I had an entirely new experience with her, before our first sex we tried knowing each other first for more than 2 months, we shared our likes, dislikes, similarities and differences, work, financial capabilities, I was surprised to learn that she was earning 5x than me, there were also discussion about things that we can tolerate and deal breakers, turns out parehas kami go getter and mataas pangarap sa buhay, kasing taas lang din ng libido namin, I learned that our previous two relationships aligned.  
  


First ex, toxic, abusive, manipulative, C H E A T E R, parang walang plano/ patutunguhan sa buhay. Yeah, aligned traumas. Second ex naman, vanilla na settled sa idea of comfort and ‘okay na to’ mentality, and happy maging receiver ng kahit ano, comfort, gifts, assurance, etc. without the bare minimum effort of giving something in return, parehas kasi kami giver/provider, and yes, vanilla, parehas kami may more than 2 years sa vanilla partners namin, she mentioned halos twice lang sila nag sex ng LDR ex niya, yung sakin naman same city lang 2 years din, but only less than 3 times, and even almost begged for that 3rd sex. So you now have an idea on both of our pent up sexual frustrations.

  
  
SKIP HERE

  
  
So eto na, exciting na part.

  
  
First sex namin, medyo rush yung pag pop ng invitation but we decided to do it, we were totally unprepared, like walang idea kung anong positions ang itr-try, yung tipong ang preparation ko lang ay mag dala ng condom and make sure na hygienic ako para good impression. Kahit sa foreplay namin reluctant pa kami kasi parehas kami di marunong mag oral- make out, tease and suck sa breasts, and finger lang ginawa ko sa kanya. I asked her multiple times if sure na ba siya gusto niya ituloy, she gave me the permission to proceed, diretso na kami missionary, i put on my condom and penetrated her, I was just warming up, slow lang but deep thrusts, making sure I’m hitting the right spots trying to feel her properly, then gradually i went deeper and pushed it a little bit harder, sabi niya “teka wait lang, you’re too rough!” ako naman nagulat kasi wala pang 5 mins yun and I was just testing the water, sabi ko “I’m just warming up.”, “Grabe? There’s more?” she said, “Okay, fuck me harder” so I did, she was moaning really loud, rolling her eyes, grabbing the sheets, and gasping, sabay sabi “grabe ka! Fuck! An sarap! Oh my god! Ganito ba talaga to?”   
  


I kept fucking her really deep and hard na parang wala akong pake kung masakit man sa kanya, it came to the point na she was feeling too good, she look me in the eye and she said “cum inside me!”, potangina, sobrang aroused ako but I stopped myself and asked her if sigurado ba siya kasi very tempting yung offer but I don’t like the risk, what she did next surprised me, she stopped me, pulled the condom off and asked me to film her using her phone, so I filmed while fucking her raw, she was really tight and I was pulling out from time to time kasi ayaw ko mag climax agad, and everytime I pulled out and rub it on her clits, she probably got impatient at some point then grabbed my dick and said “Put it back inside” while still gasping, she took a short pause and natawa dito kasi parang di niya akalain na ganon pala siya magcrave, so I stopped filming and I continued fucking her until di ko na talaga kaya, confident naman ako sa pull out game ko, I came on her, she then asked me to take a picture of her covered in cum as a souvenir sa phone niya. Imagine the picture— laspag na laspag, messy hair, but still has a pretty face with an expression that she wants more, legs wide open, pussy is dripping wet, all my cum on her stomach.

  
  
A day after that we had a conversation about contraceptives, we agreed getting it, we want the excitement and pleasure, but not the risk, so we went for the shots since sabi niya di daw siya disciplined enough for pills, when she first got it, we had to wait 2 weeks for it to be fully effective, pero parehas kami malibog eh so we still had sex before that safety net but we were careful, few rounds with condom but pull out, and raw then pull out, nothing special actually, just regular sex, it’s the third sex that was memorable for me it was my 24th birthday, she was fully protected ng contraceptives, we saw each other without the plan na mag sex, supposed to be sa starbucks lang sana kami nun, catch up about recent happenings ng life.  
  


Ang ending napunta parin kami sa motel, this time she returned the favor, ayaw niya maging pillow princess so she squat fucked my d\*ck, ang ganda niya tingnan super gentle humawak ng t\*t\* while she’s sliding down on it, an sarap pakinggan ng first moan ng penetration, and she looked even perfect bouncing up and down on me, akala ko yun na yun, just regular sex, i can feel na sobrang sikip and wet niya and i was close to my limit, i told her I’m about to cum, I kept asking her if she wanted to try mag creampie, “kahit ngayon lang please” sabi ko, i was getting really really close when she suddenly leaned forward and whispered gently “cum inside me”, without hesitation I unloaded 1 week worth of stress inside while kissing her and grabbing her tits. 

  
  
This was also surprising for me since wala sa usapan ang creampies, the contraceptives were just purely for protection from that risk, so ayun parehas na kami may breeding kink, ever since that she never lets me pull out.  
  


In less than 8 months dating her, andami kong unexpected experience sa kanya, I learned about our shared and developed kinks as well, here’s some example:  
  


CNC and exhibitionism - we’ve done cnc a couple of times everytime nag checheck-in kami, yung tipong after few rounds she would catch a nap and I’ll just use her whenever I get hard, pero iba talaga yung experience kapag overnight, it was her 21st birthday when she rented out an airbnb condo unit, somewhere in 18th floor yung room namin, yung bed is nasa window side na floor to ceiling height and in front of an ongoing construction sa other building development, during the evening, we stayed up really late having lots of sex, ansarap sa pakiramdam nung init na naka cuddle kami, I’m the big spoon, we we’re sleeping together while I’m fondling her breasts, playing with her nipples

  
  
Every time I got hard, I would slide my dick inside her without saying anything, it doesn’t matter if she was half or fully awake, I just fucked her while the curtains were partially open, the lights were out pero I’m sure it was visible from the outside, she didn’t mind it at all, I told her this a couple of times baka may nanonood samin sa kabilang building or biglang ma viral kami, sagot niya lang “I don’t care, they should enjoy the show”. Di ko mabilang nakailang rounds ako sa kanya that night. 

  
  
The next morning, I was preparing for a group study session, she teased me a lot, telling me how she still wants me inside her, of course I delivered and I fucked her in the bed and then in the table for a while, the curtains are now wide open, parang ngayon na himasmasan na siya kasi tinanong niya baka daw may manood samin, I ignored her and fucked her good till I came inside her, after we washed up I decided to grab and bring her right in front of the windows, I turned her facing the construction workers sa baba and lifted her shirt, I squeezed her tits and dry humping her, occasionally touching her pussy through her undies, supposedly giving everyone at the construction site a good show but unfortunately they missed it since busy sila masyado kakahakot ng mga materyales. I was eager to fuck her again right there but one of my review-mates called me, so hanggang dun lang yung show namin.

  
  
Bonus story: We checked a few thing from our bucket list in one day— car fun in parking area, d\*\*\*k sex, and sneaky sex, and sex while other people are in the same room, sex right after waking up — 

&#x200B;

May overnight gala kami kasama friends niya, we stayed in quarters that has multiple single beds, yung samin pinagtabi namin, before we picked up her friends, we had to visit the mall for groceries, I was looking for a parking spot when she invited me “gusto mo mag sex?”, I told her na malapit na mag open ang groceries and we might not have enough time, she said “quickie lang, you can cum inside me”, tinted lahat ng windows ko but I was still worried na baka mahuli kami, pero ako na marupok kahit takot, humanap ng parking spot, and she rode me in the driver seat when I reclined my chair, ibang klase yung suspense, hindi ko gets kung sobrang aroused ba ako sa idea na sobrang risky yung ginagawa namin or takot ako baka mahuli kami, she was riding me while being the lookout, di ko ma explain yung tightness niya everytime she strokes with her hips, it took me less than 8 mins to cum inside her, andamimg sasakyan sa paligid namin, mabuti walang nakapansin, we cleaned up and pagbaba namin lakad matatag lang talaga ginawa ko hahahaha. 

&#x200B;

Fast forward sa resort, I made a simple cocktail for her and her friends I was the only guy, sa lahat samin na andun sa venue, siya ang may pinakamababang alcohol tolerance, 2 bottles of mult and a few shots of cocktail hilong-hilo na siya, her friends and I tucked her in bed first, kami ng friends niya continue lang hanggang sa halos matamaan na lahat, I was still sober enough but everyone else decided to sleep for tomorrow’s activities, when I went to our bed, my girlfriend was really d\*\*\*k, yung tipong nakahiga lang siya pero parang umiikot daw mukha niya, it felt wrong taking advantage of her in that state but I know we have it in our list, I proceeded to her breasts first, playing with her nipple until it get hard, I grabbed her hand to stroke my dick but she was totally knocked out, I then turned her away facing the other end of the bed and lowered her clothes, I slid my dick inside her and she was already wet, in my mind “gusto niya talaga siguro to” I continued pushing my dick inside for a couple of minutes, grabbing both her nipples with one hand, until nahirapan na ako sa position, the room was dark and everyone was asleep, so I switched us to missionary, under the sheets I kept fucking her slowly but deep enough na masagad ko lahat, out of nowhere she half consciously tapped me and said “babe, tama na, baka magising si \*insert friend name\*”, I just ignored her and kept on teasing her “diba gusto mo to? You like being used like this?” i kept fucking her raw, sucking and grabbing her tits, and came inside her while she was limp from the alcohol, all her friends are still asleep, I then put on her back in her clothes and cuddled her the entire night. 

&#x200B;

Kinaumagahan, her friends are still sleeping, the first thing I did was fuck her, right there in the bed, but later we got up and went to the bathroom, I lifted her and put her on the sink, i was fucking her in standing missionary, hold both her legs and spreading them wide open for me so I could penetrate all the way inside her, i love watching her pretty expression when taking my dick, and that’s where we came together that morning, then we woke up her friends for breakfast na parang wala lang. lol. We talked about what I did to her while she was d\*\*\*k after that day and she told me she was glad to experience it in a safe environment. It was hot for her, downside lang daw hindi na record in video. She would love to watch herself get d\*\*\*k fucked by me daw.

  
  
So ayun lang haha dami pa naming experience na pwede ma share, dami din namin gusto i explore, off the table ang ‘invites’, pero sobrang haba na, tuloy ko pa ba?

  
  
Di ko alam pano ma emphasize yung gratitude ko for having her— constant reassurance, gifts, planning our future together, princess treatment, holding her closer to me every time some random guy glances her when we’re in the mall, malakas yung ‘back off aura’ niya, she gets lots of looks when we’re in public na parang nagiging invisible ako when I’m with her, other female cashiers would compliment her “Ang ganda mo naman maam!” lahat ng stalls nadadaanan namin puro “Goodmorning maam” lang ang alam, isang beses napa “tangina? Invisible ba ako?” When I noticed it happening, napatawa nalang kami, di nila alam na after namin dun hinubaran, binabastos, and creampied ko lang siya. Everyone has a high regards and respect for her, but she’s my personal slut when it comes to bed.

  
  
Anyway, to my slut princess, my personal cum dump, my little princes with dementia, I know this is our shared account, but if you’re reading this, I love you. Like I said, I don’t know how to emphasize how grateful I am to have you, but here’s another thing I want to say, atheist ako pero napapa “thank you lord” ako everytime nakikita kita.  


PS: Please po wag kayo mag dm ng invitation, our sexual curiosity is only limited within our relationship's boundary, parehas po kami monogamous. Thank you, stay wholesome, everyone!",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/18khcys/im_dating_the_girl_of_my_dreams_without_realizing/,t2_mr75jtx6p,2023-12-17 21:29:00,556
My Escort Story and How i got there. F&F urgers,"NOTE: This was before pandemic and thus the this type of market were not everywhere online that time. since covid happened it got easier to get in contact cutting the middleman.

&#x200B;

So i've been meaning to tell this story for sometime and i talked with several redditors too and gave them a glimpse of it and hey thought it was quite the story.

&#x200B;

When i (F20,at this point student,no experience) i was fairly keeping things to myself, i did the usual things my age did and i go out alot to malls with my friends.

But deep withing me, i was very confused,uncertained and terrified of my future.

I had high libido as a teen and that carried on my early 20's too and as you may know most but not every woman masterbate but alot do and that is a normal thing, it is a taboo topic thou and usually you keep this only to your self.

I watch clips,movies and erotic books to get myself going but the porn clips were to direct,movies were too bland and lack that punch so i found the joy on books, Perfect mix of romance and it does get pretty savage when it needed it as the trama of the story needed it.

I was fairly contented with this setup and i could hold my urges and never really did affect or spill on to my life until i watch an episode of a youtube discussing prostitution in the philippines, i interviewed people and gave inside views on what is going on, i remember clearly that i was shaken and how abused these women were and there were even underaged girls.

as the episode progress i learned the type of prostitutes and further on the episode we arrived at the so called High Class and also called Escorts, These women were not forced by someone and are willingly offer their service to anyone who can afford them they were talking about the difference of A class and your average prostitutes and i remember how most of them have really good figures and i was sure they were pretty too even when the faces were blurred out on the youtube episode.

I learned that they date,eat out and provide company to politicians too and that they recieved alot of gifts, When the interviewer asked a series of very interesting question she, with very confident tone answered without a trace of doubt,perfectly and onpoint conveyed her word with no stuttering, She was a very confident person and she agreed that what she is doing is not legal and fully knows the consequences of the job and that she might even be killed if she started to play on the field where strong,higher and politicians gets their escorts and such she follows certain rule, her selfconciousness about the matter and how she kept herself out of drugs and unwated attentions was so beautiful that even i could not convey such worded emotions and then she said the "" We provide company we do not offer beyond that and if it seems that way, that is intentional as we are paid by the hour and gifts are extra "".

To say the least that night i googled,facebooked and entered website/forums full advertisement and popup but i push on and on a forum a discussion where class A prostitutes can be hired.

Lets fast forward, Gonna be totally honest finding a prostitute is easy,finding someone that sells her body online can be difficult but finding an escort that i could take to a hotel was harder than i expected, I enrolled to those websites stating that members only are allowed to enter it and you need to pay a certain fee to register but most of those were fakes and scams.

To get one for myself i had to ""Physically"" be present on a certain establishment that offered shows and the entrace fee was not cheap and let alone staying and eating inside it, i went there for many saturday nights, rush hour upon rush hour just enjoying myself and finally i had my chance from a connection i made.

You cannot know how difficult being a woman with mix blood going to said establisments and getting unsolicited attention to myself, at least once i get disrupted and upset by people trying with me.

I'm gonna be honestly brutal now, Going to this journey changed me,i sold jewelries,shoes and bags to cover the constant saturday nights of just doing nothing but being there, i even used birthday gifts money and sadly told my mother a lie to get funds, I would not want this for anyone,Now you might say reddit has a fair share of content/escorts with decent apperance, there might be but trust me when i first registered this account i only looked on those profiles and i was not into them, i wanted more options.

&#x200B;

When finally i got the number of this gentleman and after i paid to exist i was led to a small room and i sat down on this 2 person sofa,i remember the room was well lit and mirrors all over and each corner connecting to a one big ring mirror.

The women flowed in on heels,those sexy sound and wavy mini skirts flowing,glittering and the room slowly filling with their perfumes, about 7-9 womens lined up infront of me.

I was surprised none of them were filipina, they were mostly chinese or some other part of asia as some of them have darker skin,some are very white, but all of them were very good looking.

I wanted a filipina as i have a certain body type and very specific likes and i was heard as after i politely asked for any 3 of them walk in the room not more than half an hour.

There she was, my type, Long hair,short legs,darker lips,fairly dark but smooth and shiny skin and i didn't know yet but underneath that dress was also what i have been craving for.

&#x200B;

I swallowed the price tag and thinking finally i'm in and will be inside her too.

&#x200B;

Awkward Situation #7: Encode,"I landed a job in corpo world. My First task is to conduct a field survey. Collection of data is hard but actually the hardest part is encoding raw data so we can analyze.

Luckily the company agreed to get a 3rd party provider to encode thousands of survey forms. There I met Z. Z is part of a computer rental chain in malls. We asked her branch if they can provide this service to us which her manager agreed.

Z was a petite, di sya blessed sa boobs but she has hips which I really like. The encoding period will take 5 days, I was tasked to monitor the encoding process so ensure correct data. That means I get to spend time with Z the whole 5 days.

So while she was on duty e I was getting to know her as well. Nakikisabay pa ako minsan when she is on lunch break. Just found out that she just had a recent break up with her long time ex. Abusive and suffocating na daw si ex nya. Out of nowhere napahirit ako

""Well in my end, its also suffocating. Kasi ihuhug tyt kita palagi"" sabay tawa 😅

So day 5 came, namention ko sa kanya na its our last day of the project.

""Sir, mamimiss kita"" said Z

""Its our last day naman, we still have hours to spend time, gusto mo extend pa natin e"" I replied

I took Z to dinner and some drinks. Medyo naging emotional pa nung naging topic ang mga ex. Until sinabi na. Kaya din daw nagstay sa relationship nya  kasi ang sarap ni ex. Ako naman medyo tipsy na e sinabi na

 ""may masarap sa ex mo, di mo lang kasi sinubukan tumikim ng iba""

Z smiled pero di smile na natatawa but smile na may grin. After our dinner and drinking session e hinatid ko na sya sa bahay nila. 

""Di pa tapos yung araw sir, 10:30 pa lang"" said Z

""Yeah oo nga e, anu plan mo?"" I asked

""Napaisip ako sir sa sinabi mo na tumikim ng iba"" Z replied with a grin

""Bakit ready ka na ba tumikim ng iba?"" asked Z.

""Walang tao sa bahay ngayon sir"" and Z gave a wink.

So I parked my car sa tapat ng bahay ng tita nya and went straight to her room. Imediately we locked our lips and kissed. I can still taste the cigarette and beer from her lips. 

I removed her clothes and she removed mine as well. Took her to bed and resumed our kissing session. I played around her boobs while my lips is still locked in hers. My hand the travelled down to her pussy. And noticed it was wet. I removed my lips from hers and immediately went down on her

""Patikim ako ah"" I said to Z. She just nodded and I proceeded in eating her out. I started licking her clit then opened it up witg my fingers. I started digging down to her pussy using my tongue. 

'Ohh shit sarap nyan"" Z exclaimed.

So I continued on with my meal. I even tongue fucked her and the moans got louder. I reached out my hands to her nipples while im still giving her a lickin good time. 

""Shit im gonna cum"" Z screamed. So tinuloy ko pa din and after a few minutes. She came and her legs were still involuntary shaking. 

I didnt waste time. Wore my condom and I immediately went on top of her and slide my dick on her pussy. Grabe it was still hot and soaking wet from her come. 

Nasa isip ko na lang na labasan. Maybe because im thinking ahead that its going to be a ONS lang naman. While pumping nagulat ako nang she sucked my nipples while on a missionary position. Grabe it gave a jolt in my body. So binilisan ko pagpump while Z was sucking my nipples very hard. 

I whispered to Z that im cumming. After a few pumps e I came. Whew. Grabe yung feeling ng excitement while im on that position. 

I went up and headed straight sa c.r nila to wash up. I dont want to spend the night sa house nila baka makita kami ng tita nya. I was surprised that Z followed me sa c.r

""Teka I wanted to taste you"" Z said.

So sa cr, while taking a shower e Z gave me a BJ. After a few lick and suck action e ready na ulit si Junior ko. Siguro im still stoked with the new position na ginawa namin ni Z kaya after a few minutes of sucking me e I came in Z's mouth. She swallowed my cum and made sure she had it all in her. 

""Sarap mo pala"" Z whispered to me

We showered together and nag paalam na ako. She mentioned that I could stay the night tutal weekend naman bukas. I declined kasi may lakad din ako nung weekend. 

I didnt hear any word from her after that. I found out na nung weekend pala e her ex proposed to her. Disnt bother to add her on any platforms. Awkward lang kasi baka gawin akong shoulder to cry on. 😅",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/mkfmse/awkward_situation_7_encode/,t2_av4lgm9m,2021-04-05 16:12:23,7
Forgiving my Ex during my Hoe phase,"Medyo matagal ako di nag share and I actually started posting here just to share my experience and hopefully people will learn from my experience. I think I gave advice on how to be a decent person during your hoe phase and as usual every advice should be taken with a little grain of salt.

So here I am again sharing with you my misadventures during my hoe phase.

This one struck me the most because if you read my previous stories you will know that I started my hoe phase when my 9yr relationship ended when she cheated. So there I was and It was 2 years after we broke up and it was the month of October and our supposed anniversary is approaching.

Truth be told I'm still not over her. I sometimes cry when I'm drunk and I remember all the good things that we had. I was suppose to propose to her before I found out that she was cheating and broke up with me.

I'm already practicing nursing at this time and I was really doing everything in my hoe phase to forget her and have fun. Had threesomes, casual sex and fuck buddies that you can count on to scratch the itch.

Then one day I received a text message from an unknown number. It read ""Hi how are you? Punta ko ng Baguio kita kita naman tyo."" No introduction and no name given. But this person knows that i'm working as a nurse in Baguio so I assumed it was a close friend in Manila and I miss them so excited ako nag reply ng ""O sino to? Bessie kaw b yan""

Then she replied ""No this *will not be named Xq* and I just want to see you"". My heart dripped and I was confused. I want to tell her off and curse at her but deep inside I also miss her and so I cave to my emotion and replied ""Sure kelan akyat mo?""

I know that flirting with an Ex is a no no but I cave. I told my housemate that my ex contacted me to meet her. He told me that it was a bad idea and he doesn't want to see me crying and being pathetic all over again. But I have the confidence that I will not be in that state again and I will never have a relationship with her ever again. I just want to be cordial and remove any animosity towards her *I know I'm lying to myself saying that* (I hate her!!)

So we met in pizza Volante. She smiled when I saw her and I smiled back. We started with a simple ""kamusta ka n?"" I told her about my professional and family life told her that my mom is doing ok and I asked her about her dad. We were just talking about our personal lives at that point.

But we all know that we have to take care of the elephant in the room so I asked her. ""Bakit ka nag cheat?"" she paused and kept quiet. Then she told me that I was too complacent that I was too nice that I becoming a bore. I want to cry but I held it in. Then I asked her ""Why cheat? why fuck him then break up with me? Why not tell me kung ano issue mo sa akin? Why not just break up with me then move on to another person? Dapat di mo pinag sabay kaming dalawa?"" I cried.. and good thing is that we are on a corner table and there are few people eating at that time.

She said I'm sorry and she felt that she got her bad karma because of what she did to me. ""She told me that the guy she cheated on will phsically abuse her."" yes mapera si gago pero un nga isang gago ung lalakeng nilandi nya. In all my years as a person never ako nanakit ng babae I avoid talking and let my self cool down to avoid saying harmful words pero eto ung exemption and I just said ""Tangina ka man lalake k n lng sa gago p? you deserve all of that""

She cried but the nice guy in me comforted her. I sincerely told her ""iningatan kita pero ang sakit na magaganun k lng dn pla."" She kissed me and I reluctantly kissed her back. We paused and just continued eating our food and she stood up and asked that she want to go with me to my place. Inom n lng daw kami.

I stopped at a nearby 711 and bought ice and juice since may alak p kmi ng bestfriend ko sa bahay. I messaged my friend if he was home and good thing na duty daw sya ng 2 days s hospital. I said I'm taking my ex home with me and he just said goodluck.

We drank on the balcony of the house. Surprisingly she started smoking nung naging sila nung lalake nya. We continued our talk opened a bottle of whisky and drank the night away. we were talking about the past our common friends, work and yes our dreams when we were together. She then asked me if I met girls as a single guy and I told her yes at ung iba mas maganda pa syo. 

She paused and asked if I slept with them and I said yes I slept with them for as long as they want. Natawa sya dun kasi ang alam nya sa akin vanilla at simple boring nga daw ako e. I told her that I learned from some of them and I know what I'm doing. Di lng ako magaling pra syo kasi tyo ung unang mag kasintahan e.

The alcohol must be taking effect cause she suddenly asked me to teach her things that I learned. She leaned towards me and gave me a kiss. I pushed her back and told her I don't like smokers. She laughed and went to the restroom to use my mouthwash. When she came back she was already naked. I can still remember her body when we were together and I stil want her.

She came over and kissed me and everything flashed back and I remembered all the things that I will do to her if given the chance to fuck her. I bit her lip, sucked her tongue, kissed her nape and nibble on her ears. I slowly went down to her neck and licked her chest. I fondled and Licked her breast and went down to her abdomen and slowly to her vagina.

This was all done on the balcony and the good thing is that our neighbors must be sleeping since no light was on at that time. I turned off our light and went back to work. I ate her pussy like a wildman. I ate her for a full 15 minutes. She was asking me to fuck her but I held it in and just ate her. She begged and told me that I can fuck her raw cause it is a safe day. I just waited and ate her and when she was about to cum I fucked her in missionary position while she is cumming. 

I was wild that night It was like punishing a girl you hate and love. I fucked her hard I pulled out my dick and shoved back in. We never had that type of sex and according to her she never experienced sex like that with anyone before. I was smiling and I was hyped. I told her that I will make her sore and flipped her to doggie style. While fucking her I just thought about the lube that was left in my room and I stopped and told her that I have a surprise for her.

Went to my room and took the lube as well as the dildo left by one of my Fuck buddies. I came back showing her the stuff that I have. She was surprised with how things are going and asked me if I will be gentle. I just told her no and that she will be sore after. 

I grabbed her hair and spat in her mouth before giving her a torrid kiss. She was surprised yet she looks happy so I took the lube and poured it over my dick and the dildo. She then asked me on what am I planning and I told her that I will take you virginity again. 

She held her butt coz she knows I'm going to do anal. I told her I will be gentle this time and I ate her pussy then ate her ass. I squirted ky jelly in her ass like an enema and she quiffed and went running to the rest room to relieve herself. She went out the rest room and she told me that she doesn't know me anymore. I told her that I changed but I will make you feel good.

She smiled and kissed me and I slowly slipped my middle finger in her sliperry ass and lifted her up the table to fuck her pussy. I was just imagining things that I will do to humiliate ger but I never expected her to be into it. I bend her forwards and fucked her from behind on top of the table. I can see her butt and I inserted 1 finger and as she slowly moans I added another finger then a few minutes goes by I added a dash of lube and another finger which makes it a total of 3 fingers in her ass.

I kept fucking her and she is moaning louder than usual. I took the dildo which is a little bit thicker than my dick and I placed the tip in her ass. She paused for a while a she said it was painful yet I told her to ease into it and you will be ok. She refused and asked for just my fingers. I obliged and stopped fucking her pussy and used my dick in her ass instead. It was the tip first and she just moaned then I slowly fucked her till she eased into it and slowly my whole dick is in her ass.

I told her that we can change position and I will fuck her on top of the table. She lied on her back and fucked her ass slowly as I grabbed the dildo and jammed it in her pussy. She was moaning loudly she was enjoying it. I picked up the pace and fuck her ass faster. The night was long and we kept fucking till sunrise the alcohol prevented me from cumming but when the time comes I came inside her ass. We did it several times that night and we were exhausted.

After the deed she told me that she was really sorry and asked if I will take her back. I said let me think about it a
cause this is just the alcohol and sex speaking but right now is not the best time to decide. She frowned and cried and I hugged her and told her that I have forgiven you but being in a relationship with you again is something that I have to think about.

I took her to the hotel since she is staying in baguio for a week. We saw each other during that time we had sex after I showed her around baguio. We were intimate but as the week goes by she will go back to Manila. She asked me again if I will take her back. I just told her that I love her but the trust that I previously have for her is broken and I can't enter a relationshio without it. She almost cried but held it in. She hugged me and told me that she made a mistake letting me go and she wishes me happiness and meet the girl of my dreams.

Fast forward to present. I'm a happily married man who overcame his Hoe phase and heartbeak. She is a happily married woman who met a nice guy who will take care of her (He is not as good looking as me but he is still one of the good guys).",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/y3v0o4/forgiving_my_ex_during_my_hoe_phase/,t2_4pmd2y13,2022-10-14 22:10:39,30
I met my ex today,"I don't really know how to start telling my story, I've never told anyone this story ever since my ex and I broke up. Yep, not even my closest friends or family, so please bare with me. I guess I'll just start at the day that I met her. It was the first day of school at my 2nd year in High School. I was a transferee, didn't know anyone at my new school and I was nearly an hour late for the first day of school because my dad didn't expect that Commonwealth and EDSA traffic would add about an hour and thirty mins or so to our travel time. By the time that I got to school the classrooms were empty. I asked the Janitor on our floor where everyone was, apparently there was a first day Orientation and Flag Ceremony at the quadrangle. He gave me directions and so I went. When I got there I was immediately intimidated because the place was packed, all elem and highschool students were congregated there. I stuck out like a sore thumb because I was the only one wearing a Bag and I had my lunchbox at hand. I panicked and picked the nearest group of students that had the same colored lanyard as I did (different years had corresponding colors) and Fell in line. The guy standing in front of me asked if I was a part of the class, I told him my year and section and he immediately told me I was at the wrong place and he didn't know where my section was located, He asked this girl in his class if she knew where my class was at, when she turned our way I was stunned by how pretty and perfect this girl was. Her fair complexion contrasts perfectly with her Jet-black hair that she had in a ponytail, she is chinita and her pointy little nose was a perfect combination with her thin lips, she had the prettiest smile albeit the fugly pink braces she had. This girl was my ex, Annie ( not her real name ofc) I was trying my best to hide my big ass lunchbox behind my back, Idk why but I thought I looked like a loser because of my lunch box haha!. She took me to the front of the line to ask her Class adviser where my section was located at and the teacher pointed me to where I was supposed to be at. I was so conscious about my Lunchbox that I just went straight to where I was pointed to without thanking the teacher nor Annie. The rest of the school year was uneventful, I smile at her when I see har at the canteen or hallways. But I've never really worked up the courage to talk to her. I found out that her section was a ""Star"" section, where students with high grades put in. So I studied my ass off so I could get a chance to be classmates with her. Lo and behold my efforts paid off. I became classmates with her at my third year of highschool. She was very popular and had a lot of suitors and most guys I know had a crush on her, at first I tried playing it cool and made it seem like I was into her bestfriend Tina. I've managed to get close to their group of friends, we all were having lunch together. We were friends but I had no idea how to push our relationship further. Luckily, for the school's Foundation month our batch was selected to do a stage play; Charlotte's web. I heard she wanted to play Charlotte, so I had to think of a way to get in on the action. But to my surprise most of the boys did not want to be part of the play because it was viewed as a feminine activity. So I easily got the role of Wilbur, yep the pig. Anyways I saw this as my chance. I finally had a reason to text and/or call her after school. At first I just asked her to rehearse with me. I'd call her landline if I dont have load, our daily rehearsals became daily telebabad, we would talk about anything and everything. This was the time that I became sure that I loved her and want to spend the rest of my life with her. After the school play I confessed. But I got rejected. She told me that we were too young and she wanted to focus on her studies she also said that her parents would be mad at her if she got a boyfriend. I was devastated. I lost appetite and became lethargic at home. My dad asked me what's going on with me and I told him everything. He immediately berated me for being an Idiot. He told me that there's no way that Annie did not like me because he saw/heard me on the phone with her all the time. He then pointed out that Annie said that her parents would be mad. My dad gave the best advice to my teenage self. Go tell Annie's mom that I want to court her. At this point i kinda ""knew"" her mom because she always answers their landline when I call. I went to the phone dialed their number fully expecting her mom to answer again but this time it was Annie who picked up. I didn't know what to say It was about a week after my failed confession. I haven't talked to her since. I was standing there like a fool not saying a single word, my dad nudged me and whispered ""pwede ko po bang ligawan ang anak niyo"" ( he thought it was annie's mom I was talking to) I locked in to what my dad said. I hyped myself up by exhaling then I asked Annie to pass the phone to her mom, she asked why I just said ""basta"". I was so out of It when her mom said hello I went straight to the point without saying hello or who I am I repeated what my dad said verbatim "" pwede ko po ba ligawan anak niyo"" after that I don't remember much of the conversation. The adrenaline rush finished and I was so embarrassed and light headed. All I remember was her mom saying that she will talk to her husband about it. I was so scared to go to school the next day I feigned sickness but my dad practically dragged me out of bed and threw me to the shower then when I got dressed he shoved me to the school bus. At recess Annie said she wanted to talk to me my heart was literally trying to jump out of my chest I was sweating bullets then she broke the good news. Her parents agreed as long as we update them about every step of our relationship. I courted her for 4 months before she became my girlfriend. I met her parents a few times already at this point. My dad would drive me to their place at the weekends so her parents could get to know me. Tito June and Tita Marie (annie's parents, not real names) were very kind and welcoming to me. They would even drive me back home in the afternoon when I go to their place on Saturdays. Summer vacation came and I'd be at their place almost every week, sometimes annie went to my place. they accepted me into the family. We went out on dates, albeit supervised It was the best days of my life. We even went to the same review center for our college exams. We applied for the same schools but we we're aiming for UP because her parents and my dad and uncles were alumni there. We motivated each other to study hard so we could go to the same university. UPCAT day came she had a bad case of the flu but she soldiered on. The results came out Unfortunately she didn't pass. But I did. When she got the results she cried non stop, I didn't have the heart to tell her that I passed. So I just told her na I don't know if I passed or not. But I didn''t know that she already saw my name on the passing list. She was telling me to do good and make her proud that she would do her best so she could transfer Over after a year. It broke my heart. I talked to my parents about going to UST together with Annie they did not want me to give up UP at first because "" its for my future."" I told them that my future is with annie. They eventually gave me the blessing that I so desperately wanted, they let me dump UP for UST. Our relationship grew better and stronger than ever. We went to UST with her bestfriend and our classmate Tina, we enrolled the same course and got to be on the same block. We made new friends, I met my bestfriend who is a Stoner. we had the time of our lives in college. I tried to push our relationship further, as a man I wanted some Intimacy, But she never really agreed to go all the way. The most we've done is third base and some dry humping. Annie told me that she wanted to wait for marriage before we did the deed. I was disappointed ofc, but I did not want to risk ruining our relationship because of my 2nd head. So I settled for being stuck in foreplay everytime. And I learned to be happy and satisfied about it. We would talk about how many kids we wanted, what kind of house we wanted to buy. Everything was perfect. We would get into arguments but we always worked it out. Then on our third year in college ( we loved UST and the friends we made so we decided not to transfer to UP) we had a big fight. My stoner bestfriend took me to a house Party where we smoked a lot of weed and drank heavily. Apparently I was dancing and ""Flirting"" with multiple girls that night. Someone ratted me out, idk who. But we had mutual friends on that party so it could be anyone. But I swear to god I did not have any intentions to flirt I just wanted to have fun at the party, the people there were willing to testify that I always mentioned that I had a Girlfriend to the point of it being annoying. But she still got mad at me which is very understandable. She became cold to me for about a week, then everything became normal again. Until about a month later, Annie told me that she was ready to have sex with me. I was so happy when she called me that night. I Got so excited I trimmed my bush, took a bath multiple times that night. Keep in mind that we were supposed to check in at afternoon the next day HAHA. At first I wanted to ask what happened to waiting for marriage, just as a joke but decided not to, maybe it would ruin my chances. Then as I was about to fall asleep, my phone rang. It was Tina, her bestfriend. I was kinda weirded out at first because it was past midnight and she was just doing small talk with me. I felt that there was something wrong and just told her that if there's something going on just get straight to it im about to lose my virginity tomorrow, I didn't say that last part out loud tho hahaha. Then she told me that she knows that Annie and I were about to have sex the next day. She told me not to do it. I always suspected that Tina had a bit of a thing for me, Its hard not to notice after being with her for a few years, So I thought that she was just jealous. In the nicest way possible I told her that its none of her business and I hang up. She rang my phone over and over, I was about to block her number so I could go to sleep but something in me wanted to answer the phone and just be all rude and aggressive so shed stop. As I answered it I did not even get the chance to speak Tina said ""Buntis si Annie."" It caught me off guard I was stunned for a Sec then I got so mad at Tina for making up the most ridiculous of lies, I was about to bombard her with the most hurtful words in my vocabulary but she hang up, As I was about to ring Tina back she sent me screenshots of her convos with Annie. I saw Annie's messages saying that she is indeed pregnant, messages saying she didn't know what to do because she knows that the guy definitely wouldn't take responsibility and she could not find it in her conscience to have an abortion all of the stuff you'd expect to see. Then I read something that scarred me for life. Her plan was to get me to take responsibility for it. At first I was doubting all of it, because how could this perfect woman do this to me. I called Tina and told her that its too much that she didn't have to fake stuff to get in between Annie and I . She told me its all true she gave me her email and facebook password so I could verify. As I logged in to check her messages, its real. Its all there. I didnt sleep the whole night, I dont know how it happened but time just flew past with me staring at my ceiling till the afternoon the next day. I did not confront Annie yet because I was scared of the truth. I got up ate food, then prepared to go out. I borrowed my dad's car and I picked up annie so we could go on our ""date"" The whole car ride to the motel I didn't say a word, I just used my ums and oos as answers. We checked in She asked me whats wrong, I told her im scared, which is 100% true. I was scared that its all true. She asked me if I wanted to go shower with her. I told her that she should go shower alone because I already took multiple baths in preparation for this. As if I was a robot I got undressed and sat at the edge of the bed sitting there waiting for Annie to get out of the shower. I was having delusions that Everything tina told me was a lie, and ill just have sex with Annie and blow my load inside her and were going to raise a kid together. The minutes felt like days, then she finally got out of the shower, She looked a bit shocked because I was already butt naked on the bed. She smirked and dropped her towel. It was not the first time I saw her body, but I still remember thinking that ""she really is perfect no"" she walked over to me and we kissed then I held her face with both hands, I was about to confront her but the words are just not leaving my mouth. I told her to help me get in the mood, then I gestured to my flaccid penis, she obliged, but I was not getting hard at all. About a min of work she stopped I was staring at the wall behind her, she stood up to the point where her eyes met mine she asked me whats going on, then it just came out of my mouth ""Buntis ka ba?"", She fell to her knees crying. It confirmed it all for me. All the anger that I was trying to keep bottled up and hidden away came out. I slapped her. It was hard. to the point that her nose bled. She just cried there on the floor with me completely dumbfounded with what I just did. It was the first and only time that I've hit someone. Then I cried along with her. I don't know how long the two of us, butt naked one on the floor the other at the edge of the bed crying. But after some time I got dressed took her clothes and tried to put it on her But she took it out of my hands and got dressed herself. I told her that we're leaving. I did not want to take her home myself but I also did not just want to leave her all alone because she's got little to no experience on dealing with public transpo on her own. I hailed her a cab, gave the driver the address my phone number and Directions. I took a photo of the driver and made sure he saw me do it i had the flash on. I slipped the driver 1000 pesos told him to take her home. I drove over to my bestfriends condo. Got high as fuck, Then I called Tina. I told her im at Dave's condo what happened and as I was so out of my wits I told her to go to where I am so I could fuck her brains out, a little sanity came over me and I dropped the call and put the phone in airplane mode immediately. Dave was laughing his ass off and I laughed together with him. We rolled a few more joints and watched random things on youtube to get stuff out of my mind. A few hours passed Dave's intercom rang, it was the front desk asking to validate a guest, It was Tina. At first I thought Dave was just fucking with me then he got dressed and told me to take care of the place and do the laundry the next day grabbed his wallet and just left. I was so sure that hes just fucking with me and just went down to get food that he ordered or something. Then I hear a very light knocking on the door I looked through the peep hole. It was Tina. I pulled her to the bedroom I lit a joint and told her to undress. As she was removing her clothes I was hitting the joint faster and faster, and I got harder and harder not like what happened earlier that day. My dick was pumped and ready for action she went down on me without me even asking for it. I just closed my eyes and finished the joint I was holding until I popped in her mouth. I did not even warn her. I looked down at her she was gagging from all the cum I blew up her mouth I felt bad and gave her a Towel to spit on and a glass of water. I pushed her on her back lifted both her legs and I ate her out till he was practically screaming out of ecstasy I told her to bite the towel so shes not as loud and I continued till all the sheets were wet. I was getting hard again after seeing the pleasure she was in. I asked her if she wants to get fucked, while still biting the towel she moaned an ""oo"". I fucked her, at first I was shocked because there was a little bit of blood, Then I remembered that she was a virgin too, I was trying to go as slow as possible but she was just clenching on my dick so hard and she seemed to be enjoying it so it just went ham. I had three pops from penetration plus the one where she sucked me off then I ran out of gas and fell asleep. I slept about 15 hours after that. I dont know how tina Did it but when I woke up all the sheets were off the bed and put in the washing machine. When I got out of the bedroom Dave had a big smirk on his face he told me that a just got home just as Tina was leaving he told me that Tina Did all the laundry and left. I went for my phone, I noticed that I was still on airplane mode, when I turned airplane mode off I was bombarded with text messages and calls from My parents and Tina' parents. Her dad even texted me that he was going to shoot me when he sees me, Apparently they thought I raped Annie. Apparently annie did not want to get out of the cab, she also did not want to give Directions to her house the driver tried to call me but I was out of reach. Luckily they were already at the subdivision So the driver just went to the security guards at the gate and showed them the address I wrote. Annie's parents asked her what was going on when the cab was at the gate of her house But she just cried and cried and did not want to talk. The cab driver just told Tito June and Tita Marie that he Picked up Annie at a motel and an angry guy gave him the directions as to where to drop her off. The bruise from my slap was still evident. So they thought that Physically and Sexually abused her. I called my Dad first and told him what had happened. He told me to go to Annie's house and he's already there. Cops are coming to take a statement too. There's a cop car already parked in front of their gate when I got there. Emotions were high when I got there Tito June was all fired up, But I was calm because I know what I did and I readied myself to be taken in because I slapped Annie. But after talking about what happened and me showing Annie's convos with Tina. They were finally able to coax Annie out of her locked room by telling Her that im about to be taken to jail because I was suspected of Rape. She cleared things up. Cops left, and I had a long heart to heart talk with Tito June and Tita Marie . Then I never saw them again after that night. I dropped out of school that semester. And I've never Seen Annie for six years Till today. She owns this Little local Coffee and tea shop near the gym that I go to. I was surprised to see her behind the counter even through the mask and faceshield I knew it was her, we locked eyes and I knew that she realized who I was. We sat down and finally had closure. She showed me pics of her daughter who looked like a little angel. She told me that she's starting to date again. She has a boyfriend of over a year now, she told me that he treats her and her daughter well, which made me happy for her. I lied to her and told her that I've already had multiple serious relationships since we broke up. But here I am still the same broken man, afraid of relationships and even worse I can only get hard when im high on weed. But im happy that we had closure perhaps its time for me to move on to the next chapter in my life. If you've read this far thank you for listening to my story. I had to get this out of my chest. Perhaps I can find love again. Sorry, wrote this in one go, If there are a lot of grammatical and syntax errors forgive me for my carelessness I don't want to proofread anymore HAHA.",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/qtxdsa/i_met_my_ex_today/,t2_ggqvtmbh,2021-11-15 03:30:47,867
