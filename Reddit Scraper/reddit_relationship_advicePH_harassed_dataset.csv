I (27F) feel like the guy I’m dating (24M) is moving too fast and I’m uncomfy,"So I met this guy named Sasha (charot meme reference lang po) 😂 na meet ko siya sa bumble—we met, we clicked, we conquered. Kaya lang, masyado siyang mabilis for me! Parang sumali naman ng marathon si kuys.

By mabilis, I mean na nakapagsabi na siya ng “I love you” (one month pa lang kaming nag-uusap), naipakilala na niya ako sa parents niya and loved ones (again, one month pa lang kaming nag-uusap), and he’s also too touchy (ISANG BESES PA LANG KAMING NAGKITA NETO). I felt off kasi hinahawakan na yung hands ko and waist tapos nag-ask na siya for a kiss on the first date.

Masyado na bang palaban ang mga bagets ngayon? Nakakatakot 😔

Ang tanong ko is—normal lang ba talaga yan or napag-iwanan na ko ng panahon? btw hindi naman yung uncomfy na parang I felt sexually harassed ah! Nabibilisan nga lang ako tas di rin kasi ako sure pa na gusto ko na mag commit sa kanya pero parang sure na sure na kasi siya 😭 help",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/11wcmkj/i_27f_feel_like_the_guy_im_dating_24m_is_moving/,t2_7hlu6at6o,2023-03-20 16:08:55,7
"i (25F) want to move out because my mother (46F) is physically, emotionally and mentally abusive and i need a safer space to heal. ","hi redditph! it’s my first time posting here but before i get this off my chest, i just wanna say i appreciate all of you here.

so, here goes. (TW: abuse, sexual harassment, suicide attempt)

short bg, i’m 25F and the eldest daughter of a broken family. parents are separated but both already have their own partners now. i have 2 younger brothers, aged 23 and 16. 

i’ve only been working for 2+ months because i graduated at 24. i never stopped school, i just transferred schools due to 3 separate incidents involving sexual assault, sexual harassment from a prof and theft by fraud. 

why am i telling you this? because it’s part of the reason why i want to move out—my mother did not offer me support in circumstances like these wherein i needed the counsel of a parent. 

she didn’t believe i was sexually assaulted by a classmate. she instead screamed at me and asked me if i was drunk when it happened, what i was wearing, and if the guy who assaulted me was my boyfriend. (did not drink, was wearing my uniform and the guy was bi—he had a bf and all.) i reported it to my former uni but also to no avail.

she never did anything about my prof who continuously harassed me for 2 years. i explained to her countless times that he kept asking me out to dinner and drinks, just me and him. he also keeps inviting me to chat through secret conversations in messenger. i never budged so he failed me on one of his classes. i lost my chance to be a dean’s lister because of him. she just shrugged it off like it was nothing.

although, she did something to my classmate/dormmate who failed to pay her share for rent that she borrowed from us. she had her blottered at 2 barangays. 

these are just a few examples of the challenges i faced in life. since then, i’m sad to say, i had to go through worse stuff and my mother still wasn’t there even after i reached out. 

apart from that, there’s also the pathological lying, violent tendencies and deep unresolved anger issues. 

lately i just realized she constantly lies about our family. she had been telling people that she paid for my tuition even if my dad did. (he rightfully deserves the credit.) the worst one was one time we were together and someone asked if i was her daughter, she denied it. 

there’s also the violence i can’t take anymore. whenever she gets upset with us while driving, she goes into a road rage. she speeds through highways to get her point across. she throws things at us and somehow i always get the brunt of it. the worst one happened last year and i finally had the courage to record it (sound recording). it was clear in the audio that she was hitting me while i was telling her it hurts. 

in 2014, i was diagnosed with major depressive disorder during my parents’ initial break up. in 2020, i relapsed and (shamefully & regretfully) tried to take my own life. now i even developed severe anxiety and a slight eating disorder. i’m only 38kg at 5’2”. 

there are still nights when i feel too overwhelmed. but i never went to my mother again. i’m more scared of hearing what she’ll say than of hearing my own last breath. 

i know that i make mistakes, sometimes it’s really my fault why she’s mad. i’m not the perfect daughter. i already constantly beat myself up for it—without them needing to add to it. 

but i finally see now that i don’t have to be perfect to be loved and cared for. i don’t deserve to be hurt anymore.

right now, my simple wish is to start my healing journey, far away from her. to have my own safe space, to establish new boundaries and to have a place to finally start living after being on survival mode for so long. 

i worry about my brothers but after i asked them, they confirmed that she never hit them, unlike me. and they know enough not to depend on her for emotional support. 

one of my brothers will be graduating and working soon too. but i promised my youngest brother that they both have the option to live with me if they wish. i only survived because of them. i want to give them a better life. 

but the thing is, even if my mother has been a great burden to my emotional, mental and physical wellbeing, she is still my mother. i still want to move out with her approval and blessing. i still want to support her financially and maybe when time comes, even more than that. because maybe i’m not the only one who needs therapy. i want to help her. when she’s ready too. 

me, i’m finally ready to put myself first. but how do i even start telling her that i’m moving out? do you have any advice for a situation like mine?

thanks, redditph! ❤️‍🩹",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/1armukf/i_25f_want_to_move_out_because_my_mother_46f_is/,t2_pid2dds1a,2024-02-16 02:48:15,1
i was a bad sister and i’m 100% sure it has greatly affected my younger sibling. what should we do?,"I (22F) don’t really have a great relationship with my younger (and only) sister (18F).

I was such a bully when we were younger, and nung nag-dalaga, sobrang bugnutin ko naman pagdating sakanya. Palaging naka-sigaw at bulyaw, palaging irita, and I am sure na ang laking epekto nun sa kapatid ko. Idagdag pa ‘yung parents namin na, according to her, ay masyadong overbearing. Hindi talaga maganda ang family dynamic namin—it’s like we’re all just roommates sharing the house. 

These past few months, she started opening up to our mom about her past experiences sa school: she was bullied from elementary, and was sexually harassed (and was bullied again) noong high school by her girl friends. She opened up about how she couldn’t forgive them, at gusto niya ma-earn ang respect nila by being an achiever ngayong SHS na siya. She wanted to prove them something to the point na hindi na healthy for her mental health. Hindi raw niya makalimutan lahat ng mga nangyari sakanya—mga nagawa ko, ng mga magulang namin, at ng mga so called friends niya. Para raw siyang mababaliw. 

Hindi na namin alam ng nanay ko kung paano siya mabibigyan ng advice. She kept asking me paano ginawa ko since I experienced the same things as well, but tbh ‘di ko rin alam sasabihin. We don’t know how to help her cope or process her emotions.

Napatawad na raw niya parents namin, I have apologized to her many times na rin, pero naiisip at naiisip pa rin daw niya palagi.

Aside from seeking professional help (we suggested magpa-check na siya pero ayaw niya pa), what should we do? Paano nga ba talaga magsisimula ‘pag ganito?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/11okmoo/i_was_a_bad_sister_and_im_100_sure_it_has_greatly/,t2_in4vsafv,2023-03-11 21:47:57,3
I(19M) am forced to work with my ex(19F) and she is intentionally driving me nuts and I need to either confront her or get over,"Need advice on how to confront either or get over my ex harassing me at work.  
  
This summer I've got a job at this company with my girlfriend (we were still dating at the time). Long story short - I dumped her and she did not take it well. And so after the breakup we still work here and it's not going great..  
  
So fresh into the breakup we've had a conflict, basically I didn't set any boundaries considering work, and she did something very off-putting to me, and I kinda snapped at her. Nothing that unprecedented, it's just that she never saw this side of me. So kind of started this whole work thing after breakup on the wrong foot.  
  
The relationship itself wasn't a fluke btw. It was my first long term experience (different cities, so long distance as well): 5 months, then we kinda took a break because apparently, even though we established mutual feelings for each other (I thought that well, now we are in a relationship with all of the ""I love you"" and speaking on the phone and texting 24/7 - so I acted accordingly), but we didn't establish the fact that we were dating, so the whole 5 months she had a ""sex buddy"" in the face of her ex boyfriend.  
  
In actuality I broke up with her first (somewhere around december), cause she acted distant and some other phycological bullshit I experienced at the time. And about the ""sex buddy"" I found out later after the new years, in a heartbreaking pity call from her (she was trying to get me back...).  
  
So we took a break...  
  
But this whole relationship experience was kinda connected with a childhood trauma of mine - so even after the incident I had feelings for her, and I think that in my mind, the perception of her was working like it would work in an abusive relationship. So, one more long story short - we got back together.  
  
You already get the sense that she was and is kinda crazy. And I think if I were to tell the whole story, I would just get bullied for not running away from her much and much earlier.  
  
So, after another 5 months of multiple arguments, a shitload of cash I've spend on her, all the depressive episodes I had, etc etc - the vacation that we went on together finally got me. Shortly after, when I got some alone time on a press-conference I went without her after the trip, I finally was able to look at the entirety of our situation from my point of view. And so the decision arose.  
  
I presented the breakup to her like ""I wasn't ready for the long term, I got to get my shit together, yade yade"". She cried, but I was free.  
  
And now we're here.  
  
To the point: we work in the same team on a bunch of projects (cause we're still trainees), and the way she sets the group against me, the way she communicates with me in group chats is so toxic. But it's tricky, cause it's very subtle, so that only I know that she's mocking me. I can't really say anything to the bosses - and why would I. I know she is trying to get my attention, and I won't give it to her. But it's hard. She made her profile picture a photo taken in my clothes I forgot at hers, she logged into my google account saved on her computer (forgot to delete) and worked on a shared google doc, etc etc. It's subtle, but the entirety of it collectively on a daily basis, makes me go insane from constant anger and hatred towards her. It's kinda traumatizing to even look at her face during meetings, plus all of that crap.  
  
Yeah, I came out of the relationship kind of a fucked up, and in order to actually get my shit together and move on, I gotta get this resolved.  
  
Quitting is not an option as well, cause I'm a student, and overall, not including her in the equation - it's a dream job that I was looking for for years.  
  
So yeah, don't know what to do at this point. Talking to her is not an option - she will just gaslight me, that I'm imagining all of that, etc.  
  
Tldr: ex girlfriend harasses me at work and I can't really do anything about it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/16jp3jx/i19m_am_forced_to_work_with_my_ex19f_and_she_is/,t2_igk3v0cvh,2023-09-16 05:15:04,2
Found something while online stalking my boyfriend's ex's social media and don't know what to do about it,"TW // mentions of sexual assault, minor mentions of suicide

This was already posted in r/Advice, just need as much advice as I can get. 

I've been incredibly torn on what to do about this for a few weeks now and really need some sort of advice. 

I (21F) have been with my boyfriend (22M) for around a year. I am incredibly nosey and, though I have no fears in my relationship, occasionally stalk my boyfriend's ex's (22F) social media accounts. Recently, I found my way onto her Facebook page. I scrolled a bit and found a post from a few months ago that has me incredibly freaked out. It was a post from some months back saying that on that day one year ago, my now boyfriend had sexually assaulted her. They had broken up just a few months before but were still living together at the time. No details were given on what happened so that's basically all I know about the alleged assault.

I have always thought of myself as someone who would immediately end a relationship if my partner were accused of something like this, but I have what I think is fair reason to be suspicious of these claims. 

After a few months of bf and I being together, ex messaged and told him she wants to get back together. Throughout their relationship, she was incredibly mentally abusive and controlling, causing him to have no life outside of their relationship because she wouldn't let him. He declined to get back together and she lost her mind. This lead to months of stalking and harassment from her. For the next few months, her attempts to get him to take her back include:

• Showing up to his house multiple times unannounced until he had to threaten calling the police so she would leave. 

• Messaging his friends and family to ask them to try and convince him to take her back. 

• Multiple threats on her own life, including holding a knife to her throat when she found out he was so much as in the talking stage with me.

• Spam calling him and spam messaging him on every platform constantly, even when she got no response.

• After he finally blocked her, showing up at his job to confront him.

All of these incidents happened many months after the alleged assault. He had finally blocked her 3 months before she made the post about the assault. Taking all of this into account, I don't think it's crazy to wonder if the post was some way to get back at him for not taking her back. I don't want to jump to any conclusions, I think I'm just terrified of what he'll say when I talk to him about it. The absolute best case scenario is that he didn't do it, but if that is true, that means there is still a post out there accusing him of something so horrific. There is no good outcome in the conversation, as the worst case scenario just means he DID assault her. 

I'm not worried about how he'll feel about me finding the post (I am incredibly open with him and he knows that I stalk her accounts on occasion), I just am scared for what the outcome will be. It's so easy to say this, but I cannot imagine him assaulting someone. He has never been anywhere near pushy when it comes to sex, and I cannot fathom the possibility that he might've assaulted someone. 

Everything I detailed about the he endured throughout their relationship or the time she was stalking him I was either there for or have been shown proof of, so I have no reason to doubt that. 

I just don't know where to go from here. He's noticed me being very upset and panicked recently but I've told him I can't talk about it yet. I promised that I will bring it up though, because regardless of the truth, it isn't fair for me to not share what I know. The part of me that has been assaulted myself is mad at me for doubting her story, but the part of me that was there for her stalking/harassment and knows him well is still so skeptical of everything.

I just need some honest advice on if my logic makes sense and how to confront him with this, please. Thank you for reading. 


This is my first Reddit post and I don't know how it works yet, I am just hoping this post doesn't get too much attention so that I can make sure it isn't found by any involved parties. Just need advice from a few people please.

I (18f) keep going back to my (18m) manipulative and cheating boyfriend because he is my first real love,"I ‘18F’ have been with my boyfriend ‘18M’ on and off for 11 months, which is my longest relationship. from the jump he has always degraded me for having past relationships (i’m his second ever girlfriend, his first was for 2 weeks)
I know why he would get mad at me, because he’s somewhat of an incel but it still hurt very bad because i’d always put him on a pedestal. 
We would always look at his tiktok’s on his phone and he would like videos of half naked, beautiful women who looked nothing like me. he would also like the incel videos saying it was okay for men to cheat on women but not the other way around, but he would gaslight me into thinking he “just thought the videos were funny”. He was a virgin before me, but his phone was polluted with porn, and when we started doing “things” on  facetime, he would screen record me without me knowing and without my consent, and this went on from october until now, and i just found out about it. he had been watching porn and sending nudes to girls online and lying to me about it our whole relationship, and i had my suspicions but he always gaslit me into thinking i was crazy.

later on, we both had a class with this girl ‘18F’ that used to be my friend but me and my bf just decided she was annoying and we both didn’t like her. He would always make fun of her hair and skin and everything else. Months later i moved to a different city 2 hours away, and long story short, he told everyone at that school that me and him weren’t together, and she (the girl we didn’t like) would sit in my seat and flirt with him. they also went on two dates. after constantly reassuring me that she was ugly and annoying, in reality he was cheating on me with her. Her personality is disgusting, but physically, she is so much prettier and richer than me, and to be honest she probably got with my boyfriend because she knew she could. she had always caused drama with others at the school.
I was so mad, i cut things off with him, broke up with him, and after two days, he started harassing me. I blocked him but he bought an app that had endless phone numbers and he called me hundreds of times. He even sent flowers to my house with a note saying he was sorry. 
fast forward, i got back with him because he was sobbing and begging me to take him back, saying things like “i can’t live without you”
not even a week later, i catch him in a OF girls comment section on reddit to “dm him” after i saw this, he DENIED it and said it wasn’t him, and then proceeded to delete the comment. i couldn’t believe him, he was trying to gaslight me with something i saw with my own eyes. finally, he admitted to it and started crying. he would also keep in contact with the girl he cheated with even though i told him id leave if he kept in contact. It may sound crazy that ive stayed this long, but he stuck with me through so much and i still crave his love, because when he shows me love it’s like i forget all of the shit he’s put me through.
i feel so worthless, and ugly compared to her. i don’t even know how he got her, because he’s not very good looking and very scrawny.
i don’t know how to leave this relationship, he treats me so bad and has recently started yelling at me. i just moved to this new city and i have no friends, he’s all i have. i want to leave but i feel like i wouldn’t know what to do with myself without him. what do i do? how do i find self worth? how do i stop comparing myself to the girl he cheated with? there’s so much more to this story, i know it’s long but i tried to just include the main stuff.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/1azyxdi/i_18f_keep_going_back_to_my_18m_manipulative_and/,t2_uc9og3bb,2024-02-26 05:05:37,1
Bigla sya nagbago after a trip. hindi kona sya kilala and he’s nit the same person I agreed to be with.,"I’ve(F21) have been with my boyfriend (M23) for 2yrs now and have known him for 3. he’s a really caring bf and helps with house chores which I appreciate a lot. I’ve dealt with sexual harassment before and he still accepts me. I thought he was the one. but recently we went to a trip with my cousins (M25 and F23) while waiting for the train my F cousin was sitting on her luggage and my ‘bf’ was squatting in front of her(she was wearing a mini skirt and he was basically eye level to her thighs also it was kinda close 2 people could stand in between them) and when we talked abt it he said he didn’t do it on purpose so I just brushed it off. and then the first day of the trip I caught a fever so I went ahead and slept (it was like 6/7pm already) but I woke up because they were talking and I heard my cousins wanted to go out but was worried about me. then what surprised me was my bf was pushing for the three of them to just go because ‘she’s not gonna wake up anyway we should just go’ but my cousins made him stay with me and he was upset by it. but it hurt cuz I didn’t expect that he could leave me im that state he usually takes care of me when im sick. we talked about it and he denied wanting to leave me at first because he didn’t know I heard the whole conversation. but when I was telling him the exact words he said then he said sorry and thought I was just tired. but that’s not possible because he was with me the whole time and he saw how much my nose and eyes were watering from the abrupt changes of temperature. then in the morning I want to get our charger from him then I saw in his screen ‘ear licking asmr’ and ‘tongue flicking asmr’ I was so overwhelmed because in the 3 years I’ve known him this was the first time i saw it. (that same day in the bus ride home he watched it again btw) so I was just silent the whole trip just thinking. until we argued because he was getting lost in the crowd and we wanted to check out some stores that we pass by (its a big city plus we had a bus to catch later on so we had to stick together) I was so mad I told him ‘wtf we’ve been calling you’ and he screamed ‘what’s wrong with ur attitude’ and after that I just shut down and went to the corner. I was so embarrassed to my cousins that they had to see that. and so Im thinking about breaking up I just don’t know who he is anymore he’s I don’t know if I can trust him since he kept the ‘asmr stuff from me but my best friend is telling me that since its our first long trip together we were bound to argue and that we could still fix it she also told me that there’s not that much men who help with chores and are clean and I also know that he’s not a bad person and he is good bf material in general I think I just have to spell it out to him specifically what he needs to do which is bad cuz I feel like Im just maneuvering him. Im tired is this matter worth forgiving? is it worth fixing?I really don’t know what to do please help

to add more details we called after the trip since we lived far apart he told me he was sorry about blowing up on me about the attitude thing he said he was just tired. he told me that he was upset because he also felt  like I was a different person since I wouldn’t kiss him or do pda (out of respect for my cousins who their significant others weren’t present) the most Id do was hold his hand when my cousins were in front of us. I did tell him in advance about the no pda stuff because my cousins requested for it. and that im mainly inviting him so my M cousins has someone to bond with because he is waay hyper and too full of energy its hard to keep up so he was well informed about that matter.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/1ajm2j0/bigla_sya_nagbago_after_a_trip_hindi_kona_sya/,t2_d568t1qf,2024-02-06 01:27:20,1

I [M18] am having trouble being friends with someone [F18] because of my feelings for her but I really want to keep the friendship stable and intact.,"Hai guys It's my first time here, I made this alt acc so my friends don't catch me here asking for relationship advice on reddit. I'm sorry for any wording/format mistakes along the way, I tend to go too emotional on this topic but I'll try to keep things organized. I just know I'm gonna sound like a little brother asking help from his kuyas and ates cuz of my age and lack of social experience so please bear with me po I'm still growing :3c

&#x200B;

**BACKGROUND**

I \[M18\] met this girl \[F18\] a year ago in college, and we were frequently groupmates for 3 terms. Eventually I did catch potential feelings for her and it scared the living hell out of me because I know its gonna ruin me if I kept it bottled up. Anyways I bottled it up for a few months like the dumdum I always was until a few months ago when I admitted that I liked her out of fear na I wont be classmates with her ever again for the following terms, I really enjoyed her presence. I wasn't expecting for us to be a thing pero yah I got friendzoned which I knew was coming but it still hurts to experience it for the first time. But from then on we've been talking frequently, almost everyday for the past 3 months. Btw when I admitted how I felt to her, we BARELY knew each other as in outside of school and I went off with no build up yes I know you may laugh that was very dumb of me but I'm planning to give it a second chance next year, next time I'll do it properly.

&#x200B;

**THE SITUATION**

Okay this is the part where I freak out. I know I can be very funny, mature, smart, responsible, etc. but everything about me gets thrown out the window whenever I'm around this girl or even the thought of her immediately makes me weak asf. I keep showing her this side of me that I don't even show to my closest of friends, I revealed to this girl that I secretly like to wear bracelets but hide it under my sweaters, I really love flowers, I secretly like cats, etc. And it's crazy cuz the conversations we have aren't what I normally would with anyone cuz no way you would catch me unironically talking about FNAF n mfking DIBO THE GIFT DRAGON with anyone but her. I'm friends with her, but sometimes there are moments lang that makes ppl question if we \[M18, F18\] are dating or whatever (It would be nice but the thought of us being together lowkey freaks me out). Just moments like that time na nag-earthquake po dito sa manila, it woke me up and the first thing that automatically came to my mind was to text her if she's okay cuz she has morning classes, its so dumb that she's always the first to come to mind and I dislike it. One time ha, there was this time na she texted me that she will be leaving the school to go somewhere and I was like ""OH! PLEASE BE CAREFUL"" out of panic kasi I'm familiar with the area she's going to, it's really dangerous and I almost got robbed/harassed multiple times in the past when I crossed that area, what more pa if it's a girl crossing the place by herself? I wished I was there to help her cross the place but idk maybe I'm just overreacting? ah and there are times na I visited her class to give gifts, this only happened twice, and they were gift baskets, one was a belated birthday gift with vocaloid stickers and the other was to let her borrow a FNAF plush n korean candies to help her in her studies idk. Ugh it's all so stupid why did I show too much of my sweet side... I love her but man the shit I do is messing my mind up, I'm not even doing this to make her like me back or anything, I'm just expressing how I feel. I told her one time it was very late na like 1AM when she was ranting about school and I was like ""hey I'll be here for you, probably not academically lol but emotionally I'll do my best to support you"" and that's why I gave her my plush and I remember specifically saying that I'm giving the plush to help her in her studies and ""because I care about you"" and NOOOOO WHY DID I SAY THATTTT but yeah she appreciated the gesture. Basta theres lots of stuff we did like playing games together, genshin n all that, we've been in calls for a few times hours on end, I really love her voice esp when she sang dancing queen (one of my fav songs) and the way her eyes smile (dont cringe pls po, mga kuya at ate, im still a kid) and I make letters just to vent out how much I like this person yes I know I'm a dude but when it comes to love turns out I act like a middle school girl talking about her crush. I told my situation with her to my closest friends n family whom I trust the most and eh so far medyo nakakakilig daw, some of them are jealous na I get to experience love of such a high level like they want to fall in love in the same way I did or have someone fall head over heels for them. So what im getting is that the love that I'm experiencing is a rare kind on a whole different level and it's really special according to my close friends knowing that I'm usually not the type to feel romantic kind of love towards anyone and even my best friend of 6 years has admitted that he has never seen me this emotional. But thats the problem, we are just friends, even I myself want to keep it that way because the girl and I are both not ready for a relationship and I respect her boundaries na she wants to just be friends with me months ago which is totally fine if it weren't for the fact that the more I learn about her, all her flaws, traits, insecurities, I just keep falling more and more in love with this girl like please just give me something that will give me the ick, something that will make me not like you so I could take a breather from all the romance type situation but no, God really decided to be a hater and said ""nah you will fall in love hard with this girl regardless of her flaws"". Please po Lord stop giving me your toughest battles I need rest.  


Jokes aside po, I'm in desperate need of help, advice, or any insights regarding my situation. Friends advice, be there for her. Family's advice, keep talking pero aral muna. Personally what I want to do is to is to still be friends with her but secretly kill off/suppress my strong feelings for her so that the whole thing is 100% platonic for the girl's sake but idk something about that idea feels wrong even for the girl idk how to explain it. Please help po, I'm taking a break from talking to her for a while to focus on my finals. Thank you all for reading to this point and God bless!! :>

"A guy [24m] I [26f] dated hid a girl from me... the entire time. I still feel sad even tho rationally, it's not my loss","Posting this here as well, after posting on r/relationship_advice, just so I can get advice from people who understand my culture. I'll make this as short as possible, pardon the details. I'm just feeling sad. Matched with my old university schoolmate (we're both done with college, tho) on Bumble back in October 2022. I'm two years his senior in terms of school \[levels\]. Hm, we hit it off since his high school busmate was in the same course/college classes with me. We also had a bunch of other mutual friends, around 20-30? Anyway hm, he started flirting with me, sending me food/money when I was hungry. Invited me over to his apartment and we had sex (tho, I was uncomfortable and he was kind of pushy with it, this wasnt the only time he was, too tired to recount the other times). We established ourselves as FWBs and I figured, why not since he says he doesnt fuck around a lot. My mom is an Asian/Filipino helicopter mom (and I'm the eldest child, both girls), so I mentioned in passing he meet my parents so they wont look for me at night. My platonic male friends always come over too, and its all chill. So he got along well with my parents but lied about how we met (said we met thru my coworkers, one of which he also went to high school with but that's not true since they're not friends). I shrugged it off since it was a white lie. We went out to watch a movie and he bought my parents wine and food without me asking. My dad wondered why he gave them a gift since we're supposedly just friends. I shrugged it off. It went on like that til January. We'd have sex while high, sex while listening to K-R&B, go out on fancy restaurant dinners, hold hands. My mom supported our unlabeled thing and encouraged us to book AirBnbs and go on vacations abroad, even told me to meet his family and move to the States with them (at this point I feel like my mom just wants both of us to move out of our parents' house). It was all good. He didnt meet my mom just once, he was even supposed to go out and eat at his favorite restaurant with my dad (since that was his favorite restaurant too). He cooked for me, we'd have video sex while he was abroad, I'd listen to him crying about his family, talk every day, basically we liked each other. 4 months in, February, it was weird because he wasnt replying for a day, he usually texts me good morning every day. I wondered why, but paid for his new glasses via credit card anyway, since I broke the frames last time we had sex (accidentally sat on it since he left it near the pillow). He finally replied, said thank you that I paid, then said he just booked an AirBnb with his female best friend and was about to head out for brunch. I sensed something weird but shrugged it off, tho one of my friends egged me to confront him about it. So I confronted him nicely. That was when he started getting passive-aggressive about me prying into his private life. He said he was tired of explaining to people they were really just friends, and later that night, he blocked me. I was devastated enough to message our old schoolmates/friends and asked for help. One of them told me the truth and said he wasnt hanging out with that female best friend of his, but another girl he's been in a situationship with since March 2022. So he was lying the whole time lol. The last time I saw him, he was firm with his lie. Old friends/uni schoolmates confronted him without me asking, since apparently he used an acquaintance's name to tell the other girl he met me at this acquaintance's house party instead of a dating app. They asked the other girl about me, and she still believes the lie that I met him at a house party, and is downplaying his bad behavior. When they confronted him, he claimed that I was crazy, forced myself on him, and sexually harassed him. (That was weird and initially upsetting to me because, I never touched his genitals without consent and he touched mine without consent. I was so upset I called him up to confront him about that. After apologizing via text to my parents since they didnt want to talk to him, he blocked me everywhere again).

Well, that was a lot and I'm thankful I'm blocked since he was dramatic, toxic, and had a big ego (said I'm the hottest person he's ever been with and now I'm the crazy one). He also uhhh... lies to my mom about certain things just to impress her (my mom confronted him about this). If youre wondering why he met my parents, it's an old Filipino rule, for a guy to meet parents (Google: ligaw culture) and my mom still strictly adheres to that on top of being careful with her daughters, which is kind of weird but what can I do?

I'm trying to move on (it's been around 20 days since I found out the truth), but I guess my sole dilemma now is: the other girl's still staying with him despite others telling her about me. I can't figure out why. Was it something I lacked? It's irrational, but to be direct as possible, I can't help but feel sad about why he chose her over me. I know I'm supposed to feel bad for her, because I know he wont stop entertaining other girls with me, but I cant help but feel sad..? Maybe he liked her enough to tell her  I was going out with him but not the other way around? I dont know. I just feel weird that she's overlooking his flaws, even tho that's none of my business. Am thinking of speaking to my old therapist, but I guess I was upset enough to post this on reddit in the meantime. Any advice? Do liars like him change, or did I dodge a bullet (unlike the other girl)? He was honestly cute, and we genuinely liked each other. 

&#x200B;

TLDR: Guy lied to me the whole time, and stayed with the other girl. I know it's not my loss since he lied to her too, but I can't help but feel sad that he chose her",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/11rss1d/a_guy_24m_i_26f_dated_hid_a_girl_from_me_the/,t2_w6qnimlg,2023-03-15 18:46:23,3
