Hoy! Tigil tigilan nyo nga yang pagsesend ng unsolicited d*ck pics nyo!,"I'm so sorry, pa-rant lang ako ha. Let me dump this burden on you and share it with me. Also, there will be utter profanities so I apologize in advance. 

I'm the kind of Redditor who doesn't go around looking for a relationship here. Heck, I don't even message people on Reddit for the sake of a conversation with someone, madalas talaga puro lang ako nagbabasa ng mga posts, mag cocomment from time to time. 

So few days ago, someone messaged me. Sabi nya, nagustuhan nya yung isa kong post, and he wanted to get to know me more. Syempre, I replied, but I told him I am not looking for anything serious, and definitely not doing NSFW chat. After few hours of chatting, sabi nya mag meet daw kami that day, sinabi ko na hindi ako pwede dahil madami ako kailangan gawin, the next day, niyaya nya ulit ako, sabi ko may iba akong lakad. 

Sinabi nya na ililibre nya ako ng dinner at hahatid sundo sa bahay para wala na ako iisipin, basta makipag kita lang ako sa kanya. Still, I respectfully declined him kasi hindi talaga kaya ng schedule ko, but I asked him if pwede namin plan next week magkita. He said, worried lang sya baka i'm a poser, sinabi ko naman if may doubts about my photos, we can do videocall right there and then, pero ung makipag meet, hindi talaga kaya ng schedule. Nagalit na sya sa akin. Sinabi nya na napaka arte ko daw hindi naman daw ako maganda. Oh eh di ako na ang pangit na poser. HAHAHAHAHA. Tapos sinabi pa nya ililibre na nga nya ako ng pagkain, papasakayin sa kotse nya ako pa ung choosy. Sabi nya pa, ""Swerte ka na nga inalok kita."" Wow. Eh di ikaw na gold. 

Pero hindi ko nireplyan yun mga sinabi nya, seen ko na lang. Bahala sya dyan. 

Tapos ang walanghiya bigla nagsend ng dick pic nya, walang timer kaya hindi blurry yung photo, titi nya agad nakita ko pag bukas ko ng message nya, tapos sabi nya, ""Ayaw mo ba nito? Ngayon ka lang makakatikim ng ganito tapos aarte arte ka pa."" 

Syempre seen ko lang ulit. After an hour siguro, nagmessage ulit, ""putangina mo."" Seen ko lang ulit. Nag send pa ulit sya ng isa pang dick pic, seen ko pa din, then he sent a video of him jacking off. Seen lang talaga hanggang sa he deleted the entire conversation.

Guys, I truly understand na meron kayong libog na kinikimkim, pero utang na loob, unless girls ask for it, do not send unsolicited dick pics. 

At para syo, lalakeng pikon:

I have treated and conversed with you nicely. I never gave any hint nor idea that I want anything sexual with you. I was honest from the very start, at alam mo yan. Also, hindi mo kailangan ipamukha sa akin na meron kang kotse, sesend mo pa kotse mo to prove kaya mo ako sunduin. Hindi mo din kailangan sabihin na ililibre mo ako sa kahit anong restaurant na gusto ko. Hindi ko kailangan lahat ng pinagmamalaki mo. What do you mean what can I bring to the table? Boy, I am the one who bought the fucking table.

At higit sa lahat, tama ka nung sinabi mong ngayon lang ako makakatikim ng ganyang titi. Kasi never pa ako nakatry ng maliit na titi like yours.

May idea ako on how to deal with unsolicited dick pics,"Idea lang and hindi ko rin sure if this can be useful but this is how I imagined it:

*guy suddenly sends a (poorly taken) üçÜ pic*

You: Grabe naman po pala ang isang *mention their name* ü´£ü´£

*I‚Äôm imagining na they‚Äôll take it as boosting their ego so kapag nagreact sila na parang proud sila sa nakakasukang etits nila, that‚Äôs when you drop the bomb*

You: Now that you‚Äôve confirmed that you are ____ and this is your unsolicited dick pic, the next time that you do this again hintayin mo na lang na katukin ka sa bahay niyo for a court appearance regarding your harassment.

-

I‚Äôm not sure kung ano ‚Äòyung pwede talaga ikaso but the important part is you get them to agree na they are the owner of that ugly dick para wala silang takas.

This bluff can only be used kung kakilala mo ‚Äòyung tao and not just random peeps. Up to you though if gusto mo seryosohin na idala sa court.

Kapag random lang ‚Äòyan you can ignore or laitin mo blatantly kasi mas importante sa karamihan ng lalaki ‚Äòyung ego nila kesa sa level ng IQ nila hahahahahaha",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1axp9pn/may_idea_ako_on_how_to_deal_with_unsolicited_dick/,t2_k7kua7wy,1708655377.0
Rant,"Bakit kadalasan ng mga lalaki sa Ph4rfriends pag kinausap mo na sa tg, mamanyakin ka na agad. Like di ko gets? Kadalasan pa ng manyak dun mukhang cast ng little mermaid. Mukhang galing under the sea. Ang tino tino ng ng sinasabi dun na friends or kausap hanap tapos mamanyakin niyo? I lugar niyo ka-manyakan niyo. Deserve pa din ng mga babae ng respeto. Gigil niyo ko.

Plus, sainyo na yang unsolicited d*ck pics niyo!

Edit: pag mukhang under the sea or sea creature, maging mabait na lang sana. üòÇ and hindi lahat ng lalaki online manyak! Kaya nga sabi ko ‚Äúkadalasan.‚Äù",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/14biq85/rant/,t2_t7erlszr,1686980923.0

Nakakasawa,"Nakakasawa na makatanggap ng unsolicited dick pics. Tipong ang wholesome naman sana ng post mo, pero may mga ganun nalang bigla. Regardless the size, kasawa pa din. 


Hindi lang dito sa orange app, pero sa personal accounts din. 


Naiisip ko, aanuhin ko yang titi na yan eh hindi ko naman mahal yung tao. Lol. So ayun, dudes and dudettes, di na libog nangunguna sa utak ko. Iisang titi lang sasambahin ko forever at yun ay sa taong mamahalin ko lang.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/17xog4h/nakakasawa/,t2_nbj8dmhy,1700253464.0
The Jologs and Jejes Are Proliferating in Reddit,"Sana naman hanggang Facebook nalang sila pero dumadami na ang mga kupal na jologs at jeje sa Reddit. Hindi na masaya ang Reddit tulad dati. May mga gago pa na pinagkakakitaan mga nude pictures ng mga magiging na mga babaeng posters sa pamamagitan ng pag scam sa iba kaya nawawalan ng gana mga babae na mag post ng kanilang artistic pictures. Sa hookup subreddits naman binobombard ng unsolicited dick pics mga babae. Kahit sa Philippines na subreddit maglalagay sila Ng mema tapos kapag gusto mo ng intellectual discourse, ad hominem lang alam nila na isagot sa iyo. 

Naalala ko tuloy iyong stand up joke ni Chris Rock na n*ggas vs black people.  Lahat ng mga binanggit ni Chris Rock tungkol sa n*ggas sobra fit sa mga bagong siraulo sa Reddit. Gusto talaga nila sirain mga bagay na enjoy natin.

"Batong ipupukpok sa ulo ko: I snooped and found something, what should I do :(","First of all, let me take responsibility for doing something I know I should never have done in the first place. It was an impulse to do it, and I know very well that kapag ni-raise ko to, magiging major source sya ng away namin. Please also be respectful and avoid dismissive and judgmental comments üôè

I snooped in my boyfriend's chat messages looking for a chat group he said he created with my friends for a surprise (surprise was already done and went rather well) but instead I found a muted conversation with a guy na di familiar sa 'kin.

Curious as to why that one, out of all the other chat threads, is the only one muted, I opened and saw that he had been sending photos of himself wearing a singlet (that I gave him on our anniversary!!) to the other guy. The exchange went something like:

BF: Merry Christmas! 

BF: Eto o, pa-pecs (sends a photo of himself shirtless at the gym) 

Guy: Naks. Sarap. 

B: Obvious ba sa photo na yan na di ako naka-underwear? 

G: Hindi naman

B: E eto? Haha (sends a photo of himself wearing a singlet I gave him on our monthsary - bec he loves wrestling huhu - with a very obvious bulge) 

G: Halatang halata

B: Hahaha

Then a time stamp a few hours later

BF: Merry Christmas! (grineet nya again after di mag-reply ni guy on the same day??) 

G: Thank you! San ka mag-Pasko? 

B: Nasa *place* ako last night

G: Ahh ako nasa *place*

B: Ooh you're near hehe

G: I think so too hehe

/End of convo/

I was too stunned - my heart was racing - to do anything else. I wasn't able to backread further, pero apparently my boyfriend had sent other photos of himself to the guy in various states of undress before. Quickly lang ako nag-scroll up kasi nataranta ako and ambigat ng feeling ko bigla, halos wala na kong nagawa. Napichuran ko lang yung exchange na yun sa taas. 

I already feel bad that I've snooped. TBH, it wasn't the first time I did this, and have seen him before send shirtless pics to someone he used to date while we were already together, but that time I let it pass and said nothing huhu). 

But I feel worse having seen that conversation and what it meant. Who was the guy? Why was it muted? And why was he sending unsolicited pics of himself? For the record, I always compliment his gym bod and verbally communicate that I appreciate and like his fit body, so I don't understand this at all. Racking my brains for clues / instances / moments that could be related to this and wala talaga. We just came from a very happy out-of-town trip huhu. Ang naaalala ko lang is that recently whenever I would try to send him something saucy or hint at dirty talk in our chats, it flies right over his head and he doesn't engage... This has begun to make me feel inferior, and it doesn't help that I'm not in the best shape myself either. :(

I know bringing this up to him at this point would anger him greatly and I don't want to end the year/begin another on such a sour note. I really do love him and I want to get over this but I just feel terrible talaga. Parang dapat pala di ko na lang ginawa para di ko nakita huhu I might go crazy :(",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/zx5owm/batong_ipupukpok_sa_ulo_ko_i_snooped_and_found/,t2_652x7ybg,1672220936.0
Men on PhR4R feel so entitled,"I don't get why guys on that subreddit feel like you're obliged to reply to them. I choose not to reply for a number of valid reasons like (1) We don't vibe at all and the conversation is uninteresting; (2) Sobrang insensitive ng jokes at times to the point na mao-off ka bigla; and (3) Sending of UNSOLICITED dick pics. Sobrang nakakadiri and annoying yung 3rd reason that is why I'm taking some time off from that subreddit. 

Please lang, alam ko malalakas loob niyo kasi anonymous ang reddit pero have some decency. Buti sana kung dating or magjowa tayo para magdemand ng reply lol",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/wj4swg/men_on_phr4r_feel_so_entitled/,t2_n6kiouu4,1659952217.0
"""I can judge you but you can't do that to me here""","There's this redditor who was wondering why this platform is being used for hooking up. While said redditor went on and detailed their unfortunate experiences with receiving unsolicited dick pics and other forms of harassment, they also passed judgement on other subredditors, naming another subreddit in particular. Naturally, a heated debate started. There were those who agreed with the OP's POV and there were others who called out OP for missing the point of this entire website. 

The reason for this post is because of what happened when OP was being attacked for judging other redditors. They used the ""safe space"" card to defend themselves. Whatever OP said is their own prerogative and this is the right community to voice out their hot take, at the end of the day. But the post left me wondering: ""Wouldn't I be a hypocrite if I cried foul for being judged here after doing it myself?"".",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/107ajae/i_can_judge_you_but_you_cant_do_that_to_me_here/,t2_sebrqj67,1673258088.0
Do men just forget what consent is when their little head takes over?,"I just wanna rant and let this out. I'm so bothered by it, something happened just a while ago. Sama na natin yung recent din na other instances of men violating this. Yea sure I'm in my hoe phase and I'm open to NSFW stuff, we've flirted but that does not make it okay for you to show me or make me listen to something without even a warning. Anything unsolicited may it be pics, vids, audios, or a phone call. Have you forgotten about consent? You're grown ass men. Learn to be sensitive and fucking ask me first if I want it or not. Jeez how hard can it be diba. I get it you're comfortable with me but now I'm uncomfortable talking to you. A simple sorry just won't cut it, can't even admit what you did wrong or how you're gonna make up for it. Ugh I'm mad but can't even express it tangina.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/rzqiho/do_men_just_forget_what_consent_is_when_their/,t2_3nkwxe2y,1641730758.0
Some GMRC or basic decency guide when using r4r‚Äôs,"People in r4r‚Äôs typically fall into being bored, lonely, horny, genuinely curious to meet new people, or a cocktail mix of any of these. Between the threat of the Damocles‚Äô dagger of the pandemic and the new terribly ugly movie about historical revisionism, here are some GMRC or basic decency guide when using r4r‚Äôs:


1.) ‚ÄúExchanging pictures‚Äù means both parties sending their picture to one another, and not one person sending his/her selfie to the other person and then getting blocked or their convo deleted upon receipt.

2.) If after exchanging pictures and you don‚Äôt feel/like the other person, tell politely the other party about it if you have a brave heart. If you‚Äôre too shy or does not have the courage to do it, you can let your convo demise slowly. 

3.) Do not take screenshot of selfies being exchanged, unless you obtain permission **BEFORE** saving a copy.

4.) Avoid heavy use of filter or other picture-enhancing app to the selfies that you are going to use for number 1. This is cheating. Trust me, you will reap what you sow.

5.) Preferences are preferences, whether they are deeply profound or plain silly. You can mock them in private, but never ever guilt-trip others of their personal choices. *Kanya-kanyang trip iyan, walang basagan.*

6.) Unsolicited dick pics are not cool and sexy. 

7.) Respect each other‚Äôs privacy. A lot if not all people here enjoy navigating Reddit in anonimity.

I think I'm Done,"I don't understand people sometimes. I'm a very honest person, but not to the extent of just being an asshole. It's easier for me to be true than to pretend so I'm as truthful as I can be. I say it like I mean it. I don't understand why some people say one thing but then mean the exact opposite. 
Like, for example: when I ask if you're okay if I do this and that so I'll be busy, then you say it's okay, I believe you, and I trust that you meant it. Then when I talk to you after I'm done, you're all cold and just resort to answering with one liners? 
Why? why do people do that? It's not just a single person but I've met several now and it's getting really really annoying. Are people not true to their word anymore? What happened to mutual respect? It's getting really tiring, too. To think in this age where communication has supposedly become better, people would at least be able to mean what they say and just be honest in general. I understand people have apprehensions and I understand that people aren't like me at all. I just dont understand why everything has to be so difficult than it already is.

Even meeting people is difficult, whether it may be for something casual or something more intimate. It doesn't help that most of us guys assume and act like they're porn stars and send unsolicited dick pics, thus making it even more difficult for women to like us or even be interested cause now, they'd have to think and assume we're all like that, cause those assholes are everywhere, and I mean everwhere.

There's also the matters of age. I know it's a non-issue for a lot of people but then I've met some young people who seemingly have no respect for someone older than them. Someone called me a fossil once, as a joke. Of course I laughed it off, I'm not a buzzkill, but why didn't that feel right?

I dunno. 
Maybe I should just stop trying to meet people cause it seems like I'm not cut out for it. 
Or maybe the problem is with me, not everyone else.

Maybe it's 'old school' now to still feel stuff.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/uiqcp3/i_think_im_done/,t2_7b2v0mw2,1651728816.0
