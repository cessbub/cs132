I was harassed!,"I'M STILL SHAKING RIGHT NOW. Naiiyak ako. 
Just today at  7.40 am ,naglalakad ako sa tapat ng Heritage Hotel—mind you, I was brisk walking. Maraming naglalakad sa sidewalk. I didn't know na may kasabay ako na lalaki sa likod ko. Bigla niya akong hinawakan sa bewang at binayo ng mabilis! Putangina! Tapos bigla syang tumakbo ng mabilis! 
I was frozen. Hindi ako nakasigaw! Tumakbo nang mabilis yung lalaki. I wasn't able to scream or run after him. My legs are shaking from what happened. While I'm writing this I'm crying and nasa jeep ako. I'm so scared. Umaga pa to nangyari, eh 7pm ang uwian ko, I don't know if I can do it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/18hv1i7/i_was_harassed/,t2_oant9z6u,1702511683.0
I got sexually harassed. I stood up for myself.,"It all happened when I was commuting going to school, early in the morning, kay aga aga may masamang nangyari sakin, 

Nakaarrive ako sa terminal na pinagsasakayan ko - bus, dahil malapit na mapuno ang bus, ang kulang nalang ay lima (5), isa ako sa limang kulang. Dahil nga may kulang nalang, nasa dulong bahagi na ako nakaupo ng bus, supposedly limang tao lang dapat ang nakaupo, pero 6 kami (may nakaupo na isa katabi ang bintana bago nagsabi ng may kulang pa na pasahero), ako ay nasa pagitan ng dalawang lalaki, 2nd to the last ako sa bintana which is on my right side, at sa left side ko naman ay yung gago, so siksikan. 

Habang nasa gitna ng daan, may kung ano mang akong nararamdaman sa dibdib ko, kaliwang(left) bahagi ng dibdib ko, nung una akala ko ay ang aking ID, dahil yakap ko sa aking harapan ay ang aking bag at pagitan nun ay ang ID ko, pinabayaan ko muna, pero dahil hindi nananahimik ang utak ko dahil iba na talaga ang nararamdaman ko sa dibdib ko, parang bang bulate't sinusundot ang kaliwang bahagi ng dibdib ko, 

Doon na ako natakot, nanginig, at malapit nang umiyak dahil sa pangyayayaring iyon, yung gagong katabi ko sa kaliwa ay daliri nya ang sumusundot sa kaliwang bahagi ng dibdib, hindi sa gilid ng dibdib kundi MALAPIT SA GITNA ng dibdib, dahil sinilip ko ng kaonti ang pagitan ng dibdib ko at bag, at doon ko natagpuan na hindi siko, DALIRI NYA, dalawang daliri (left hand, Index and middle finger), kumabaga ang posisyon ng arms nya ay naka crossarm sya, under ang left arm/hand, so patago nya na paulit ulit sinusundot ang dibdib ko, hindi ko na nabilang kung ilang beses nya ginawa dahil natakot ako, hindi ko alam ang aking gagawin, ang daming pumapasok sa isip ko, gusto ko lang naman makarating sa school, nakaranas pa ako ng ganon. 

Pero hindi tama iyon, harassment, crime na sya, hindi ako aalis at pupunta sa school na para bang walang nangyari, hindi ganon, hindi pwede, hindi pwede makakalayas sya nang ganon kadali dahil sa ginagawa nya, hindi, hindi ako pumayag. 

Sumigaw ako, umiiyak, sabay kuha ng kadiring dalawang daliri nung gago na nakapwesto nga sa kaliwang bahagi ng dibdib ko. Nagalit ako, nagmura, wala na akong pake kung sino man nakarinig, pero one thing for sure, rinig lahat ng mga pasahero, rinig hangang sa driver ng bus ang sigaw ko. 

Lumapit yung konduktor, ipinalipat ng bagong pwuesto yung gago, malayo sa akin, at sinabi sakin (yung konduktor) na mag reklamo ako, sumangayon rin yung ibang pasahero doon sa row ko. At doon ko na tinuloy ang reklamo ko, at buti nalang hindi sya pwedeng makababa, nagalit yung driver at hindi sya papayagan makababa yung gago. 

Hangang sa may nadaanan kaming mga pulis at doon kaming parehas ibinaba at doon ko itinuloy ang reklamo ko. 

At alam nyo pa kung ano ang mas nakakagago? 

Habang nilagay ko ang narrative ko, and personal info, nilagay ko rin yung kay gago since sya ang suspect, and ano ang nakita ko? 

Barangay Tanod sya, yung gagong iyon ay isang barangay tanod. 

Na hindi man nya alam ang Anti-Bastos law? Puta sya. Ang kapal ng mukha nya.




Please sa mga kababaihan, sa mga tao, wag kayong matakot na magreklamo, ipagtanggol nyo ang iyong karapatan, protektahan nyo ang sarili nyo, ni hindi ko alam kung bakit tayo pa ang gagawa ng mga paraan para lang maging safe tayo sa mga ganitong mga pangyayari kung pwede nalang silang maglaho, yung mga gantong klaseng tao.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/16uc1pq/i_got_sexually_harassed_i_stood_up_for_myself/,t2_jjw4azjc,1695896050.0
I was harassed while admitted in the hospital.,"TW: Sexual harassment

Hi there, I'm a guy and I just need to get this off my chest. I was due for a scheduled operation at a private hospital in Manila (sounds like Mcdo) a couple of weeks ago. So I admitted myself late in the evening and went to my private room. There was this night-shift male nurse who went after me and met me. Now, I have nothing against gay men, I have dear friends and colleagues who are also gay. But this male nurse was very unprofessional and made me really uncomfortable.

While speaking to me, instead of saying my first name or at least ""sir"", he kept addressing me as ""daddy"". His tone of voice was flirtatious and he was looking at me differently which made me very uncomfortable. He slipped it at first probably trying to test the waters then when I ignored it he continuously called me that.

When he asked me to fill out papers he sat next to me at my hospital bed and was inappropriately touching my hand, arm, and leg. I could have said something but I already froze because of my anxiety. I was told by medical friends that personnel aren't allowed to sit on hospital beds.

When he was putting an IV on my hand, a colleague of his, a nursing assistant, was there and he was boasting about how he was sponsored by his boyfriend that's how he was able to finish college, and that they've been together for years, and how he likes moreno and tall guys while flirtatiously looking at me. All that talking made him not focus on what he was doing and after injecting the IV into my hand, blood started to squirt out and drip on the bed, I was just in shock. He apologized and again called me ""daddy"".

The last time he returned to my room that evening was when I requested to have the sheets changed because of all the blood. It took a while and he said that it was because he had to attend to the patient next door who had breast cancer and another patient down the hall who he was complaining about not being ""cooperative"". It's just disappointing how for his profession he would even tell me these private things about other people, all while calling me ""daddy"".

He eventually stopped and started being professional when my wife came and that's when he lied low a bit and started calling me sir.

Anyways, thanks for the read. It's been bugging me for weeks now. The wife has been helping me get through it though so it helps a lot.

Take care, people.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/16sxyx7/i_was_harassed_while_admitted_in_the_hospital/,t2_2d0rer6v,1695757855.0
[Sexual Harassment] Tinangka na naman akong gawing querida,"Ganito nalang ba palagi? Pangalawang lalakeng childhood friend ko na to na nanggulo sakin kahit may asawa / live-in partner / fiancee na sila.

Itago ko nalang sya sa pangalang Jason. Jowa ko sya nung high school. Matalino, magaling magsalita, medyo mayaman rin. Nung una magkaaway kami pero eventually na super inlababo ako sa kanya. Kaya niligawan ko at naging kami.

E may ibang gustong gawin si Jason. Di ko nalang sasabihin pero ayaw nya sa sex daw --- kasi may **ibang fetish** sya. E ako nga inlababo so binigay ko kahit ayoko naman talaga. Ginagaslight ko pa nga sarili ko na gusto ko yun kahit di naman.

EDIT: For the record, wala akong problema sa kink at fetish (meron din ako)...pero ang importante kasi ay MAY CONSENT at hindi mo pinipilit ang tao kahit ayaw nila.

Eventually nalaman ko na may pinopormahan sya sa school nya. So I broke up with him. Pero tanga nga, di ko binlock. Hanggang ignore lang. Kahit na may mga gf sya, nag memessage siya na humingi ng 'session.' Di ko pinapansin. Mga 10 years na ganyan yata. Minsan pumupunta pa nga sya sa bahay namin sa probinsya pag alam nya nandun ako. Tumatago lang ako at dinededma sya.

2024. Nagising ako na may halos 30+ missed calls. Tapos may tumawag. Antok na antok ako kaya sinagot ko. Si Jason pa rin, humihingi ng 'session.'

Chineck ko FB nya after almost 5 years. Puta, **kaka propose nya lang sa fiancee nya nung December**.

Nag panic attack ako. This is not the first time a married (or about to be married) man tried to make me complicit in their cheating. At ayaw na ayaw ko yan. Grabeng trigger ko yan. Nag breakdown ako ng malala.

Ganito nalang ba talaga tingin nila sakin? Kesyo open-minded ako at single pwede na nila akong babuyin ng ganito? Puta may mga morals pa ako. Kahit mag-alok pa sila sakin ng isang milyon, di pa rin ako tatanggap kung di gusto ng partner nila.

Binlock ko na talaga sya sa lahat. At gumawa ako ng Google Doc letter para sa fiancee nya, complete with screenshots. Pero sinabihan ako ni ate na wag nalang isend kasi daw baka aawayin pa ako. Seryoso na allegations ang sexual harassment na ginawa nya sakin. Pwede syang matanggalan ng lisensya. At may kapit ang pamilya nya sa pulitiko. Baka daw sasampahan ako ng cyberlibel. Kahit matatalo sila, mapapagastos at masestress pa rin ako.

Since then parang palagi nalang akong on the edge. Minsan galit, minsan breakdown. I feel so dirty. Kahit ngayon naiiyak ako. Ilang years na akong medyo okay sana pero puta ganito pa talaga ang start ng 2024 ko.

Kaya kayong mga gagong tao na nagche-cheat sa mga partner nyo. Sana iwan nyo nalang partner nyo pag di nyo naman nakukuha ang gusto nyo. Kaysa mandamay pa ng ibang tao lalo na yung mga ayaw naman ng ganyan.

And Jason, fuck you. I will talk to my lawyer friends and I will make you pay, some way or another.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/19efil4/sexual_harassment_tinangka_na_naman_akong_gawing/,t2_s1d5z,1706097703.0
"Experiencing workplace harassment, desperate for a new job","Trigger Warning ⚠️

I'm being harassed at my current job. I've only been working here for 1 month. It's a US-based company,  WFH pero i'm being sexually harassed by my boss thru messages, and pag hindi ako nagrespond, i'm being threatened na ififire daw ako. So there's blackmail involved too.

Now sahod na sana this 15, pero he's threatening to hold my salary if hindi ko ginawa mga gusto niya (makipagkita sa kanya, flirt back, send explicit photos etc) Sobrang naiipit ako kasi gagamitin ko sana yung sahod pang bayad sa review center, i'm planning to take the board exams this August.Yung review mag-sstart na this April. I really need an income right now. Balak ko sana kunin lang sahod this month tapos mag-resign na, pero bina-blackmail naman ako na hindi ibibigay. Saka na daw ako sasahod pag nakipagkita na ako sa kanya (which I have to travel abroad pa, and i'll be there with him kung saan wala akong kilala. just the thought of it scares me)

I only have this 1 month experience in HR. I have a degree in Psychology, just graduated last year. Please if you know any job openings in HR, preferably remote/hybrid since i'm in the province. Wala masyadong job opportunities dito. I probably sound desperate but I'm in dire need of another job. Almost everyday I get anxiety attacks pag may notif na nagmessage na naman siya. Hindi ko kaya tumagal pa dito :')",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1aqi8uf/experiencing_workplace_harassment_desperate_for_a/,t2_k0oak5uzy,1707899752.0
I moved out of our house because my mom kept on harassing me about my virginity,"My mom is super religious and since I was a kid, I have been told to keep my virginity till I get married. In short, Sex after marriage dapat haha. My mom and I were so close as I was growing up dahil sinusunod ko lahat ng gusto niya. No boyfriend bago grumaduate ng college, bawal mag dorm, bawal sleepovers, bawal out of town with friends.  Sobrang dami kong hindi nagawa growing up dahil palaging sheltered at restricted.  Kung magkaka boyfriend man ako, dapat same religious belief din or else my boyfriend will be crucified 😅

Fast forward after I graduated in  college, I had the opportunity to work abroad. I felt so free for once in my life. I explored a lot  of things, and I also met my boyfriend abroad. While we’re abroad, I had this ex “friend” whom I didn’t know was spying me and my boyfriend and then she reported everything to my mom. We were roommates so she knew every move that I did. So lahat ng gala, ginagawa namin, na report niya lahat yun.


 And when it’s finally time for us to go back to PH, my mom was paranoid as fuck. She kept on asking me about personal stuff and she always observes how my body looks different to prove that I’m no longer a virgin. But even if I’m not, does it matter?  Does  it define me? :(  I’m 25 yet she still treats me as if I’m a kid.


So in the end, I decided to move out of our house without informing them. Hindi na lang ako umuwi. I felt so bad that I have to do it this way pero what else could I do? I miss my family pero I won’t trade the freedom that I have now that I’m on my own.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/16zf6go/i_moved_out_of_our_house_because_my_mom_kept_on/,t2_cl4s79f8,1696398739.0
I’m not sure if I (a guy) was harassed in the workplace by an older female colleague,"I don’t know where to start but here we go. I’m a medical intern (a guy in my mid-20s) and was on duty last night. In this particular ward, I designated alone. I only had nurses to accompany me with work all night. 

I would occasionally chat with these nurses to pass time and to get our minds off the errands we had to do. It was a relatively chill night so we had a lot of downtime. 

There was this nurse who would say stuff which was actually funny. She’s probably in her 40s. However, she started making weird comments about me. She told me I had nice skin and that I looked like a model. 

They asked me if I was single (and I was). Maybe I should’ve said I had a girlfriend to cut the conversation short idk. Well, they would say stuff like “bakit hindi mo nalang kami ligawan, doc?”. Whenever I’d ask them to carry out something or check on the patients for me, she’s retort with “ligawan mo muna ako, doc” or even (this made me barf) “kiss mo muna ako, doc”.

This went on for the whole night shift. There was this instance where I said something about how I wanted to take things slowly (I forgot the context of the conversation but it was 100% work-related) to which she replied “ay si doc gusto mabagal, ako naman gustong gusto ko yung mabilisan lang, kaya mo ba yun doc?”. I knew what she was implying but I pretended I didn’t understand what she was saying. 

The last straw for me was when I was looking for the large bandage scissors. I asked them “saan yung scissors? Yung malaki?”. She promptly replied “eto doc yung bandage scissors na malaki, eh yung /sayo/ doc malaki ba yan?”.

Damn I felt so uncomfortable. I don’t know how else to share this experience with anyone else because I feel like as a guy, society would jusy laugh at me for making a big deal out of this. 

I have to give it to all the women out there for putting up with worse shit like this every single day. Men don’t deserve you. 

And to all my guys, I hope we normalize conversations like this because if this were the other way around and a older man would stay weird stuff like this to a younger girl, the world would go wild on the guy. 

I just felt like I needed to share this because I’m not that comfortable telling people because I’m not sure if what I felt was valid. But there’s one thing I’m sure of, I felt harassed.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/133cwhg/im_not_sure_if_i_a_guy_was_harassed_in_the/,t2_zatjs,1682819607.0
i (27M) was harassed again,"Tangina ng mga taong nangsesexually harassed.

When I was 16 years old, nagpagupit ako sa salon malapit sa bahay namin. First time kong pumunta doon. After ng gupit, may nilagay sa buhok ko. For treatment daw at dinala ako sa ""treatment"" room. Yung 40ish year old guy harassed me. I was groped. He even offered me to have sex with his friend. Tangina 16 pa lang ako nun. Frozen ako sa nangyari.

3 days ago, 10 years later. Kawork ko naman nangharass sakin. First time namin lumabas as workmates. Niyaya nya ko magyosi at pota hayok na hayok sya. Hinalikan ako and hinawak hawakan din ako.

Harassment,"It’s been a few years since I sexually harassed my used to be bestfriend. Throw stones at me all you want, I’ll let you. I deserve them. It’s been years but the guilt has never died down. I regret it everyday. It’s true what they say “nasa huli ang pagsisisi”. More than a decade of friendship wasted. Once, I attempted to unalive myself. I couldn’t take it anymore. Unfortunately my brother saw what I was about to do. My life since then was all downhill. Couldn’t focus sa studies, spent 8 years total in college (for a 4 year course). Di ko alam kung para saan tong sinusulat ko, pero nagising lang ako ulit na gusto ko mag unalive ulit. Hindi ko alam if letting go burden to or open letter na nagbabakasakali  na makita ng ex bestfriend ko. Sometimes grabe na talaga ang guilt. 
Pero if you’re here, reading this. Sorry again. Thank you for not pressing charges or telling your mom. Doon palang hiyang hiyang na ako magpakita ng mukha sayo. Tapos kinaya mo pang iinvite ako ulit sa bahay nyo kasi nag reunion highschool friends. Thank you. I hope you’re doing great.

"I was sexually harassed, now I feel like all men are manyak.","TLDR: Minanyak ako ng band lead while in vacation and now its affecting how I interact with men in general.

I went to Iloilo to travel, when I was single I always travel alone kasi wala naman ako mahila na friends kaya I learned to enjoy my own company. I’ve been to Vigan, Sagada, several mountains, beaches, Malaysia all alone and ngayon lang ako naharass. I guess what I’m trying to say it this is really my thing, d dahil broken ako or what.

My boyfriend at this time was also somewhere out of the country for work, he knows about my Iloilo trip and was very supportive about it. 

Now I’m the type or traveler na very chatty, as in. I like talking to locals, knowing their stories and what goes on in their life, this is how I enrich my experience, kahit magisa ako I always come home with a happy heart kasi full ako ng love nila due to their hospitality. 
Mahilig din ako tumanggap ng deals, as a solo traveler madaming nag o-offer ng extra food to taste, free rides and free activities - only heaven knows kung naka ilang free shit na ako, mabait din kasi ako as per them.

Anyway eto na, first night ko palang sa Iloilo hinatid ako ng owners ng kinainan kong famous batchoy-an sa airbnb ko, husband and wife sila and super kind. They dropped me off around 10:00 PM. Kaso, dahil maaga pa, nainip ako I went to a party place in Iloilo at around 12:00 AM, parang Poblacion nila kasi wala naman ako ibang mapuntahan na bukas ng ganung oras. Anyway I only went there to be entertained, comedy bar sana pero wala naman so when I heard a band playing, dun ako pumunta. 

This is where it starts. I was just minding my own business, drinking and watching the band lang. Maaga sila natapos mga 1:00 AM so nagulat ako kasi in Manila they continue playing till 4:00, actually felt stupid kasi sayang lang punta ko kasi saglit lang pala.

Then one of the band members approached me, ayan na nag start na yung ugali ko na akala mo nagfifilm ng documentary. From there, isa isa ng lumapit the rest of the band members, I was the only female pero I really didn’t mind kasi in my head gusto ko lang magkwento at makinig. I didn’t even drink a lot kasi babae ako eh and need to go home pa. Everyone was just having a good time lang, behave lang ako nakaupo tas sila nagbabaliwan sa gilid, nanonood lang ako at nakikitawa. One of the band members asked if they can drive me home, I declined kasi sabi ko I can manage, plus nandun lang sakayan ng taxi. Then isa isa ng umuwi band members, syempre nag paalam na din ako, the guy who first offered a ride home went out na din. Natira kaming apat with the band lead. 

Ngayon since konti nanga lang kami, I went to say my goodbyes na, but the leader insisted that he drives me home kasi dangerous daw. Syempre I declined. Kaso sabi nila jinajudge ko daw sila, wala naman daw silang gagawing masama sakin, grabe daw ako sakanila. Eh ang nasa isip ko nadin, regular sila tumutugtog dito so they wouldn’t ruin their reputation right? I knowwww it’s very stupid and naive of me, so dahil nahiya na din ako edi sumama nako, tyaka libre eh. 

Eto na, when we got in the vehicle the conversation was still very wholesome, until nag start na sya mag notice sa nails ko, gel polish daw yun and kissed my hand? I pulled it away agad Tangina kinikilabutan ako pag naaalala ko, I reminded him ulit that I have a boyfriend, I also told them this when they asked when I was single nung nasa bar palang, even showed them photos para clear na no agenda. And then I was kind enough pa to give him advices kasi nag dadrama sya na ang sarap ko daw siguro mag mahal kasi faithful ako sa bf ko now, tyaka lambot daw ng hands ko, I’m pretty and masarap kausap. Naisip ko nakainom lang to, what I didn’t expect was when he started to become aggressive and hugged me, tinutulak ko pa gently and I was saying I want to get off the car na, but he tightened his hug saakin and thats when I felt scared, kaya I was trying to open the door na but he kept pulling it close. I calmed him down nalang and kept sniffing the side of my neck, I then said I needed to pee, ayaw pa nya ko pababain nun but I said I might pee sa car nya so he let me go down, I went straight to the taxi na and just sat there in silence, iniinternalize ko pa what just happened. 

Kaso d pa dito natatapos, pag drop sakin ni kuya taxi, d ko na sya pinatawid, sabi ko ako nalang tatawid so he left me sa otherside ng road. Nagulat at kinabahan ako kasi I saw his car pullingover kung saan ako nakatayo, he fucking followed me home. He got off the car and he kept apologizing, ako I was just talking calmly and dismissing him kasi I just want to be inside the airbnb and be safe. 

Feeling ko ang ditry dirty ko kaya I went to the shower crying, I was so scared and disgusted, I also felt so stupid. I called my bf right away and told him everything. I spent the rest of my vacation in Iloilo na nagpapablotter, he isn’t allowed to play na dun sa restobar d ko na makasuhan kasi pinapabalik pako Iloilo also I don’t want to see him na.

Ngayon kahit genuinely nice na yung manong, like a tricycle or taxi or enforcer pag nag o-offer na na ihatid ako or nag iinsist sila to assist me even when I say “dito na lang po kuya”, bumibilis heartbeat ko and I start to feel uncomfortable. I’m trying to brush it off kasi I know they aren’t all bad. I worry kasi baka d nako maging jolly person when talking to manongs when I travel, feeling ko lahat mamanyakin ako.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/18hf9h2/i_was_sexually_harassed_now_i_feel_like_all_men/,t2_8wxik0bvv,1702468834.0
I was harassed the other day by a group of drunk bi/gay men,"So the other day I was doing a project at around 3am in the morning, pagtapos I decided to go out to buy some coffee + food na rin. I live in Manila, so kung nasaan yung apartment ko, mejo masikip yung street. Pag labas ko I saw a group na sa labas, di ko sure nung una kung umiinom ba sila, nasa gitna sila ng dadaanan ko. May idea na agad ako na mga bi/gay sila gawa ng ang lakas ng boses nila at mejo distinguishable din. At first nag dalawang isip ako kung dadaan ba ako o iikot nalang ako. Mejo ramdam ko na rin yung pagod at puyat from doing the project kaya di na ko nag insist na umikot, dumeretso nalang ako.

So ayun, wala pa ako sa mismong pwesto nila may lumapit agad sakin na isa then nag panggap na nahihilo/lasing sabay humahawak sa braso ko and nag l-lean sakin. I’d say about 10+ silang andun pero lahat sila nanunuod lang at tumatawa. May mga konting buyo pa na parang “ sige pa, tuloy mo pa “ yung sinasabi. May isa rin lumapit akala ko kukunin/pipigilan yung tropa niya sa braso ko, pero sinubukan makiyakap tas inaamoy ako. Umiwas agad ako, lalo nung sinubukan din nung isa na tanggalin mask ko, hinabol pa ko nung pag layo ko. 

At that point kabang kaba na ko, kasi sinusundan nila ako and knowing pa na ang lapit lang ng bahay ko dun. Gusto ko sila tanungin kung normal ba na ganito ginagawa nila sa mga taong di nila kilala. Gusto ko sabihin na kaya pala nag dalawang isip ako dumaan dahil ayoko maramdaman na ma-harass. Bukod sa pagod ako, ayoko rin naman mag assume na ganon mangyayari kaya di na ako umikot. May mga kaibigan din naman akong bi/gay men na masaya kasama and maging tropa kaya di ganon ang judgement ko sakanila. 

Nung pinilit ko dumaan sa gitna nila sinabi ko nalang “ Makikiraan lang po “. Tas sinabi nung isa “ Makikiraan lang daw, padaanin niyo na si kuya “ napansin siguro na nanginginig na boses ko nun. Nung pinadaan nila ako humarang ulit yung unang lumapit sakin, then tumuwad sa harap ko tas nag lasing lasingan na kesyo “ Sorry, nahihilo na kasi ako “ then imagine mo nalang pabebe voice ng lalaki 🥴

After ko dumaan wala akong naramdaman kundi takot at galit, bumili akong kape tas mga ilang oras bago ako nakauwi dahil ayoko sila maabutan na andun parin nagiinom paguwi ko. 
Halos makaubos ako ng isang kaha ng yosi, ang malungkot pa dun almost 4 months na nakalipas since ng last yosi ko, napa balik nanaman. Di ko alam, gusto nilang tanggapin sila ng majority ng mga tao pero madalas ganon asta nila (hindi lahat). Ilang araw na ako di makatulog ng maayos, akala ko rin nun makukuyog ako pag di ko nagawa gusto nila kaya grabe kaba ko. Ang brusko pa naman ng mga katawan nila 😂

Anyway, if by any chance mabasa to ng kahit isa sakanila, gusto ko sabihin na sana masaya kayo na may tao kayo na binigyan ng trauma. Di normal gawin yung mga ginawa niyo sa di niyo naman kilala, kahit sa kilala niyo rin at times. Ewan ko, yung iba sainyo masyadong entitled, sinabi pa sakin nung isang kainuman niyo na ako pa daw choosy o galit. Gago ba kayo? 🥴

Edit: Thank you everyone for the warm messages and comments. I can’t say that I’m doing alright pero I know that eventually I will be, even tho this isn’t my first time experiencing these types of situation. It’s been a rough couple of days since there are everyday struggles din na pinoproblema. I’m glad I posted and got this off my chest.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/10f2ofj/i_was_harassed_the_other_day_by_a_group_of_drunk/,t2_ncxbs8p2,1674032284.0
I was s*xually harassed when I was a kid.,"I'm a 24 M. Siguro isa na to sa skeleton inside my closet na gusto kong ilabas dito. I was a kid back then. This cousin of mine I think 17 or 18 na lalaki din. Tandang tanda ko, gabi non. Overnight naming magpipinsan. Sabi niya saken bumulong ""laro tayo, hanapan ng jolen sa dilim"" so tinago tago niya yung jolen sa damit hanggang sa shorts niya. Kapa kapa ako don pero wala lang sakin na makapa yung ano niya, i was innocent. Kinapa niya yung sakin and tried to do or*l. The pleasure is there pero hindi ko magets yung buong feeling as a kid.

Another incident was my neighbor, halos same age lang sila nung pinsan ko lalaki din. Siguro mga 10 years old lang ako neto. Niyaya ako manood ng movie sa bahay nila. Hanggang sa niyaya nya ako manood ng porn. First time ko. And habang nanood kame, he suggested that we mas**rbate together. He even demonstrated how kasi di ko pa alam non. After, sinabi niya na I should s*ck his thing kasi that's what cool adults do. And so I did. Tandang tanda ko din na sinabi ko ""hala bakit may cream silk?"" yun pala tam*d na. Sobrang inosente ko non.

Right now, nakatago pa rin tong experience na to siguro hanggang maburol na ako. Matagal ko na silang hindi kinakausap siguro lagpas 10 years na. I still am carrying that shame, that embarassment. Siguro kung wais na ako sa ganong edad, hindi ko na yun ginawa. And no, I don't want to confront or report anyone. Maayos na yung buhay ko ngayon. I got no time to dig up past mistakes.

Maybe those experiences are the reason why I am sexually confused right now. NGSB pa rin. Pero since nasa age na tayo where we self-identify ourselves, I still believe I am straight.

A Lose-Lose Situation In School (CW: Topic contains mentions of harassment),"I (18m) am a high school student in a school that resembles a dysfunctional family. They don't really care much about their children, they just want to keep up appearances so they can get more transferees in.

Anyway, yesterday, my teacher (??F, probably middle aged) was in our class, and lectured for most of the period. I have been holding my bladder for the entire lecture as I feel like it's disrespectful to disrupt a lecture just to go to the bathroom. When she declares the lecture is complete and the last 10 minutes of the period is just vacant and an opportunity for her to check the drafts in our activity, I thought it's finally time to use the bathroom. I asked for her permission, which she initially granted, but all of a sudden remembers about the activity drafts and used it as my ""bathroom pass"". She said ""asaan na muna yung draft mo?"". This is where the problem started. She barricaded my way by holding out her arm against my chest, and she was pressing with enough pressure to be called ""madiin"". I tried to play it off humorously mostly because I just want to go use the bathroom and because I'm a (self-proclaimed) pacifist and would rather eat dirt than engage in confrontations. Every response I give only makes her more aggressive and push harder against me, as I try to walk away after saying a quip, of course. I did eventually got out, but not after she condescended me one last time before I closed the door behind her.

Later that day I ask a couple of my friends about this situation and whether or not it's worth notifying my adviser about it. They kind of agree that it was unconsented touching and if I felt uncomfortable I should report it. Well I did what any student with an incident to report does, which is to approach my adviser first. We talked and she told me that my case would not be taken seriously because ""mababaw lang siya"". If you've ever been bullied or harassed growing up, you'd know the emotional turmoil of such power trips are anything but ""mababaw"". She said our school would just dismiss the case and ignore it and there's nothing we can do.

Is that it? I try to do this cleanly and legally, the school will do nothing. I take matters into my own hands, suddenly they get up off their asses because one of their faculty got hurt? Why do schools even have a protocol to only intervene when something gets major? Are they waiting for me to get hurt or raped before they finally take action? Fucking fantastic work. Oh, and just a bonus fun fact, I in fact was ganged up by a couple of students 5 years ago and reported it, and to this day it is still a pending case. The fucking culprits are about to graduate this year and that case is still pending and nothing was done because it just so happened my school was preparing for a streak of big events during the time of the incident.

Tl;dr inappropriately touched, felt uncomfortable, school won't do shit about it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1as72um/a_loselose_situation_in_school_cw_topic_contains/,t2_iz9cmxglc,1708085396.0

Men who are victims of sexual harassment.,"Just wanted to shed light with this topic. As a man, I actually have some experiences. 

&#x200B;

\- In college, there's this 1 girl na kabatch namin na sobrang touchy to the point na questionable na yung touches niya. On my personal experience, nararamdaman ko yung chest niya na nakapress sa body ko on multiple instances. Other guys na kakilala ko had the same experiences from her. There's also some additional things that she does. She's also very touchy with her hand. May it be sa arms, body, shoulders, etc. There's also an instance that this girl touch and hinihimas hinas na yung legs ng friend ko, around crotch part na. 

&#x200B;

\- I was partying at a club once, then this gay man na nasa dance floor with us. I was just dancing actualy, then hinawakan niya yung arms ko and kinagat niya. I was frozen at that time. Parang wala na rin ako nagawa. Natameme na lang ako. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/14nlob3/men_who_are_victims_of_sexual_harassment/,t2_ej9vzy81c,1688186180.0
Conflicted kung magpapapayat ba because of many sexual harassment stories,"So for context, I'm currently obese and I want to loss weight and wear cute clothes and the likes. But natatakot ako sa mga possible scenarios na baka may mangharass saken cause I would rather endure bullying(verbal) than sexual harassment. Add to my fear pa na I will be working in a male dominated industry(ME).

&#x200B;

Tapos meron pang isang post sa ibang ph subreddit kung ano mga experience nila regarding the matter and hindi talaga maiiwasan. Even if may mangyari, I don't think may magagawa ako so since hindi naman kami mayaman or may power. Kaya as much as possible I want to prevent or atleast be less of a target (ofcourse not saying na just because you are fat doesn't mean that its impossible for one to be a victim).

&#x200B;

Pumayat na rin ako dati when I was in college and not to sound arrogant, I am attractive plus I've always been confident. Back then, a lot of seniors and tried to take advantage of me, thankfully I have friends who tells me things so nakaiwas ako sa mga ganong klaseng tao pero syempre andyan pa din yung mga naririnig mo na binabastos ka and so on. 

&#x200B;

Anyway onto the present, gained all the weight back and ang tagal ko ng dilemma ito. Ayun rant lang, I hate being a women. Being pretty has a lot of privileges pero at what cost.

She was harassed by her friend,"Nangyare to last feb pa naman, kami pa ng ex ko. Muntik na syang ma rape ng ka samahan nya sa modeling during photoshoot. Kaya pala sobrang nag aalala ako nung gabing iyon, hinaharass pala sya ng partner nya at eto namang sobrang bobo na manager and photographer nila sa studio hinayaan lang yung dalawa iniwan pa. At alam naman na nakainom yung isa hinayaan lang at bakit din hating gabi pa ginawa. Nakuha na syang hubaran ng guy at noong pauwi na nakuha pa syang sundan. Mabuti nalang at naka alis agad sya.

Sobrang nakaka inis after nya sakin maikwento lahat ng nangyare ng gabing iyon, inaway nya pa ako at mag break na daw kami. Nakuha pa talaga syang sulsulan ng manyakis na yon at naniniwala agad. Sinasabi daw sa kanya na hindi daw kasi ako INC at hindi kami magkakatuluyan. Sinusulsulan sya at sinisiraan ako habang ginagawan pa sya ng kamanyakan. Mas pinalaki pa talaga nya yung walang kwentang issue na yun kaysa dun sa ginawa sa kanyang pambababoy.

About the rapist guy, he is half japanese at attractive daw talaga. Simula pa ng magkakilala sila ni ex naging friend sila at obvious na may gusto sya sa gf ko. Dumating din ang time na pinag aawayan namin yung guy dahil selos ko may time na sabay pala nya kami kinakausap until morning. Nasa call ako habang ka chat nya naman yung isa.

Nagmaka awa nalang sakin si gf(my ex) na hindi na mag file ng charges against that guy. Hindi rin alam ng parents nya ang totoong nangyare. Ayaw daw kasi nya lumala at lumaki pa ang issue at iilang tao lang din ang nakaka alam. I still have a guilt until now kahit break na kami, despite having a toxic relationahip with her. Wala din kasi akong nagawa. Idk until now hindi parin ako pinapatulog neto. Gusto ko na mag move on sa kanya.

Update: I was harassed while admitted in the hospital,"Thanks to everyone who shared their concern.

Update: I went to their customer service department and was able to speak to a representative and share my unfortunate experience. 

They were able to speak to the department/area where the nurse was assigned. As per the representative, the nurse who harassed me said that he calls everyone ‘daddy’ and ‘mommy’. He added that they will do a retraining on all their personnel and apologized. 

I didn’t follow-up on the nurse’s comments on my other accusations towards him thinking the representative already did his part. And of course, the nurse will just deny it and make another excuse. 

Anyways, I just want to move on from this and thank everyone again for their concern. My image towards the LGBTQ+ community will never change because of what he did to me. He’s just probably still too young and will need to learn from this experience. Him being called out by their management will hopefully scare him and make him change. 

Thanks again and take care everyone.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/16w2uam/update_i_was_harassed_while_admitted_in_the/,t2_2d0rer6v,1696067683.0
Public Harassment,"The GF of a Listener has been publicly bashing me on different social media platforms - IG and FB kulang nalang LinkedIn kasi she also checks my profile

Running a podcast that promotes discourse and conversation, I do my best to talk to all listeners who reach out to me and enjoy the content I have.  Talking to hundreds of people has made me appreciate each conversation as they are - and I tend to give the same energy I get back.  In my head, everything is just harmless fun and minsan for fan service I'd go with the flow and respond to messages with sexual undertones in an equally playful manner.

I've never lied about my relationship status.  My guy knows about my podcast and supports what I do.  I've never planned to or ended up meeting any of my listeners to do anything sexual (or even 'wholesome' meetups di ako pumapayag nga eh) - that would be disrespectful to my partner and using my platform in an unethical way.

Ever since she reached out to me last year and told me she'd ruin my life + other threats I was still trying to be of help to her in any way I could.   She told me she was bipolar, had depression, and was suicidal and I truly wanted her to get to a better head space.  I even joked how I've said more to her than her guy since dry ako kausap and there wasn't anything going on with me and her guy and mas may laman pa convos ko with her.  I told her she could message me anytime if that would help her feel better.  Ever since she messaged, I stopped talking to her guy na and that wasn't difficult at all for me as my relationship with him was platonic 

Last Sunday though, she sent a photo of me with my family - my dad, my mom, and my sister and asked 'do your parents know what you did?' This was when I knew I had to draw the line na.. she then proceeded to post comments on public photos and started adding and messaging people who knew me - from my work colleagues to my relatives and friends.  She added my mom and my best friend and my cousin and I found out this morning she also added my dad and told him I ruined their 8 or 10 year relationship.

She was spamming me with calls as well and messaged our work FB and IG demanding to speak to me.  I felt so scared that she would have me killed or would do worse things and I had to confide in people I trusted.  Now I cant even go out with my mom or my dad or my sister without the fear na what if she's in the same area.  I don't feel safe.  I never met her guy nor planned to meet her guy - I was just entertaining messages from an online friend who enjoyed my content.  Pero why am I being publicly harassed like this? She called me an 'adulterer' in a lot of her comments and she blames me for 'ruining' their relationship 

I am considering to file a restraining order or file for defamation or libel Pero I don't wanna ever see her or have anything to do with her. I blocked her na rin today but I still feel like she's out to get me.  I do still want her to heal and I don't want her mental health to suffer BC of a lawsuit pero the trauma she caused me and the messages she's posted and sent to people I feel like I have to stand up for myself din.  Dati kasi it was only directed to me but when she sent a photo ng family ko talaga idk anymore I don't know if I'm gonna recover from this",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/v26t4d/public_harassment/,t2_hp4ekjke,1654051405.0
Sexual Harassment,"I'm just disgusted sa mga ibang Pinoy on how they react on sexual harassment. If you're handsome or pretty and you're a victim of sexual harassment? Everybody will care, everybody will become your light shining armor. If panget ka, no one even bats an eye. They will even make jokes about sa nangyari sayo like me. I'm a victim of sexual harassment and I told what happened to my friends and ganito yung naging reply nila.

""May booking ka ba tapos ayaw mo sa kanya?""
""Lakas ng kamadag ni <Insert my name here>""

Yep. Habang nanginginig ako sa takot, ganyan yung mga sinasabi nila. They don't even bother to asked me if I'm okay or need ko ba ng kasamang umuwi.

Tama nga yung kasabihang.

How does anyone deal with sexual harassment at home?,"I’m losing trust and respect on my father

We used to be a happy family. I used to admire him.


But he cheated on my mom multiple times already.. and i was the one who caught him.. 

Isa sa mga babae niya was about 21 to 23 years old ata. Kaedad ko lang.

Then i once saw porn on his phone and it’s about families having sex together. Kadiri. Nakakatakot.


He would barge in my room without knocking. Minsan saktong pag nakahubad o nag bibihis ako. Whenever i go out of my room to go to the living room or kitchen, i would see his eyes wander sa legs ko.. minsan sa butt..


Di na ko lumalabas ng kwarto ng walang bra dahil grabe nga siya makatingin. Pero pag labas ko kanina para sana mag banyo, nakita ko siyang nakatingin sa dibdib ko.



Natatakot ako na naiiyak. Never naman niya akong hinawakan. But somehow, i feel violated. He even told me one time “kung di lang kita anak..” di na niya tinuloy. Joke niya lang yun pero nag marka sa isip ko.



Nahihirapan akong tanggapin na baka nga minamanyak ako nung tatay ko. Especially because i used to consider him as a hero. I used to have so much respect for him.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/qno0up/how_does_anyone_deal_with_sexual_harassment_at/,t2_g91ryvrn,1636156624.0
did I get harassed?,"Last week, the guy sitting behind me asked me if I could move to the seat next to me. (I originally sat in the left seat and he wanted me to switch to the right seat next to the window so that he could sit to my original seat).

It was science class, we were told to solve.

My right hand was writing, my left hand was just resting on the table. (We have a long desk for two students, and two chairs)

He suddenly held my hand, intertwined it with his hand, and then he puts it on my left thigh.

Or at some points during that time he asked for high fives which would lead on to our hands intertwined.

Or, just his bare hand, he places it on my thigh.

Of course, I slapped/punched (not that hard) his hand trying to get it away. I didn't thought of it like this before, just now. I was occupied with Science too. 

My brother would hold my hand during times that he was nauseous or dizzy. So, I thought my classmate was dizzy, and I even asked ""okay ka lang ba? nahihilo ka?"".

Later that day, he texted me asking If I wanted to go to his house, he even said that ""walang tao don"". 

Was that harassment?

Edit: I realized that he made me switch sides (closer to the window) so that no one would see what he was about to do.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/10g0uyv/did_i_get_harassed/,t2_vd4p1ph7,1674132471.0

I wasted 1 year liking a guy just for him to disrespect me and harass me.,"I had someone I liked for 1 year. I know he liked me also that year. We were super close, but then... On a random tuesday afternoon.
He facetimed me, played a compilation of a music artist moaning in one of their songs, while telling me the most disgusting shit ever about women's private parts and about doing the yk with ME

 I was shocked and furious. I ended the call immediately and blocked him from all of his social media and ghosted him for an entire 4 months. 

After 4 months, He contacted me again through a different social media account. He chatted, ""Why did you block me? I was crying the whole day. ""
 I replied, ""I dont care. You harrased me. Dont ever contact me or do any human contact with me. Got it?"" And blocked him again.

Mind you, we were still in jhs. I am still angry with him now. He has the nerve to post about being against SH and SA towards women. When he didn't even respect me.😒

i got harassed,"so today i was with my officemate on the way to a nearby carinderya/tindahan to buy some snacks. as we were approaching the place, a homeless man was standing there asking for some food or water to the owner. mukhang wala na rin sa tamang pag-iisip yung lalaki coz he was also talking to himself, saying strange things. 

initial reaction ko was pity. i was thinking of buying the food and water myself so i can give it to him. boy was i wrong. 

when we were near, he noticed us, and he particularly noticed my body. “ang laki ng suso mo ‘te! palamas naman ako niyan…” he kept repeating those words as well as saying other shit i couldn’t understand. i froze. i wanted to get angry, i wanted to scream and hit his face. but i didn’t. i don’t know if it was out of fear or of logic in the situation. 

my officemate instantly got angry, and faced the homeless guy. 

“ano sabi mo?” 
“wow tapang naman ni kuya” *continuous inaudible sentences* 

i lightly signaled to my officemate to stop. sabi ko wag nang pansinin. baliw na eh. we both just turned our backs against the guy and ignored him, while he just kept on talking to himself and asking for food. thank god he stopped verbally harassing me. sadly medj malayo yung barangay or any kind of security so we couldn’t ask for help. 

man that moment felt like a long time though, coz nawalan na kami ng mood bumili so we were just standing there, assessing what just happened. my officemate was hella pissed though. eventually we just left, walking back with anger and humiliation in our minds. 

pag nasa ganung sitwasyon ka talaga hindi mo alam kung anong gagawin mo. i could have lost my shit then and there, but i didn’t. i don’t think it was worth it. the guy obviously had mental problems. siraulo na. 
and if my officemate actually hit him, he could’ve had a weapon or something. nakakagigil lang talaga na may mga ganun pading tao sa mundo.

I got s*xually harassed when i was a kid but i didnt know it back then,"*READ AT YOUR OWN RISK*

I (21F) got harrased by my parent's friend back when I was around 10 y/o. I was innocent and hindi ko alam na na-harrased na pala ako.

I was with my parents sa church namin. Napaka-kulit ko talaga nung bata pa ako so iniwanan nila ako sa friend/churchmate nila kay Ray (not real name). Apparently, matagal na silang magkakilala and the fact na parehas silang nasa church, kampante ang magulang ko. May kailangan kasi silang kausapin at asikasuhin.

Sa loob ng church, may office dun where Ray work, to do church chores. Dinala niya ako dun kasi maglalaro daw kami. Sumunod ako sa kaniya kasi wala pa akong isip. Nung nasa loob na kami ng office, kaming dalawa lang ang nasa loob. Umupo siya sa officechair sa harap ng computer niya.

Tinanong niya ako (non verbatim), ""May papakita ako sayo."" Then sinara ang window blinds. 

Napaisip ako na ""bakit kailangan niya pa isarado yun kung maglalaro lang kami."" Pero hinayaan ko na lang kahit na weird yun.

Bumalik siya sa chair niya. Kinandong niya ako tapos inaliw aliw niya ako sa mga games niya sa computer saglit.

""Maypapakita ako sa'yo ahas"" sabi ni Ray. Hindi ko maintindihan yung tinutukoy niya. Then binuksan niya zipper niya tas nilabas niya nga YUN.

I was innocent as f*ck. Nakita ko private part niya pero hindi ko alam. Wala akong kaalam-alam.

Sinara niya kaagad then he act like nothing happened. So mabilis nawala sa isip ko yung nangyari. Naisip ko na amboring ng nangyari kasi hindi naman kami naglaro. Kaya lumabas na lang ako sa office.

Few days after, bumibisita siya dito sa bahay namin kasi at the end of the day, close si Ray sa magulang ko. Binebentahan niya kami ng pirated films, lalo na cartoons para sa akin (Usong uso yan dati). 

Months turned years hanggang sa hindi na siya pumupunta. Friends kami ni Ray sa fb at naglalike siya sa mga post ko. Nakikita ko din na active din siya manuod ng fb vids kasi nagrereact siya. Hinahayaan ko lang. 

Super late ko lang narealize yung ginawa niya nung nagstrike sa akin ang memory na 'yan na 'di ko naalalang nangyari pala. Naaawa ako sa sarili ko. Paano kung may ginawa pa siyang mas worst dun.

Upon realizing it, wala akong pinag-sabihan kahit kanino. As in kahit kanino. Gusto kong sabihin sa magulang ko kaso knowing them, hindi sila maniniwala sa akin. Sinarili ko yun hanggang ngayon.

Nung time na nagsink in sa'kin yung ginawa niya, in-unfriend ko siya sa fb ko. Hindi ko alam kung naaalala niya yung ginawa niya sa akin o alam niya pero iniisip niya na hindi ko maaalala yun kasi napakatagal na.

Tuwing gabi, iniisip ko ""paano kung hindi ako sumunod sa kaniya sa opisina. Paano kung tinuruan ako ng magulang ko tungkol sa ganitong bagay."" Edi sana hindi nangyari sa akin ito, ako pa rin may kasalanan kasi wala akong nagawa.

I earned a courage and decided to post this here sa reddit kasi gusto ko itong ilabas pero hindi ko alam kung kanino. At the same time, gusto ko manghingi ng advice. Sorry agad sa wrong grammars, di ako magaling magsulat at baka malito kayo.

"TW: RAPE, SEXUAL HARASSMENT & PEDOPHILIA i suddenly remembered all the sexual traumas i experienced like wtf","hindi ko na mabilang pala kung ilang beses ako nasexual harass ever since bata pa ako. from matandang lalaki na friends ng mama ko and papa ko before to uncles (even sarili kong tatay) and to teenage boys na akala ko kaibigan ko sila pero yung mga utak napunta lang sa tite. halos nakalimutan ko na to lahat. all my life  pala i was fucking sexualized, there are also times na late ko na narealize i was violated and harrased. i'm 22 and maybe around 6-7 years old was the first time i was molested. i feel so fucking dirty. is this a trauma response? how could i forget everything... 


right now. i'm also dealing with my nudes leaking bcs of hacking. I DON'T FUCKING GET IT. it's like my life has revolved around me being sexualized. being used by my body. i know even at 17, i was raped by my ex (the only time i was raped and thank the gods, hindi na naulit) and lost my virginity to him. boys would only approach me bcs of my body during my teens. there were times na pumayag nalang ako, pretended that i liked it but i never did. one of few regrets i'm reliving tonight. 

ano ba kasing meron sakin? malandi ba talaga ako? do i really look like uhaw ako sa titi? i know myself i don't, kaya ko mabuhay ng walang sex. i don't get easily turned on. depende nalang kung mahal kita. i have only given myself to people that i have loved. i had 5 exes. sometimes, pag binabastos na ako ng tao wala na akong pake. if being catcalled in public i would raise my finger at them. i can't say na masungit ako bcs when people greet me in public i would smile at them, even with stranger men, sometimes i would just avoid contact dahil di ko mapipigilan sarili ko na if they greet me i would eventually greet back, the same as through messaging apps i struggle when someone i know or an acquaintance would dm me i would feel rude if i don't reply. i recently knew that some of those people mistake that act of kindness as my move to show interest for them. that behavior of mine applies to all people in general. i can never ignore someone i know, unless they don't greet or talk to me first. my recent ex told me i was easy for it. i was too easy for men. was i really? should i change this behavior?

These circulating news triggers me,"When I was in Awra's friends situation, no one tried to speak up for me and defend me khit na nagsusumbong na ako. Office setup pa nga ako hinarass. 

But when these things happened, awra defended her friends against those harassers, pero the harassers was not in jail, but she was. 

Ang basura. Kaya lumalakas ang loob ng mga harassers because natotolerate yung ginagawa nila just by turning the situation around, na sila na yung victim dahilnasuntok sila sa kagaguhang ginawa nila.

Also, do not blame anyone na kaya nababastos dahil sa damit, because it is not about what people wear. I was wearing a decent casual attire. Pants, Shirt, may jacket pa nga akong suot non.

[TRIGGER WARNING: R & SH] I WAS RAPED AND SEXUALLY HARASSED AND MY FRIEND TOLD ME BAKA DAW “NOT IN THE MOOD” LANG AKO,"Potangina. Since I was just around I think 12-ish or 13 up until 15, I was raped by my friend’s brother. It became a cycle and I never thought I was raped until I was 18. It’s when I started to realize na I was raped talaga because I was a minor and he used my vulnerability as a gay teen to manipulate me, and even today I can still remember na it was him who made me watch porn for the very first time and I even asked if totoo yun and sabi nya oo and so everytime he let me watch porn, he would do exactly the same to me sa video na he made me watch. Every time I get penetrated I feel so empty and frozen that time, speaking up or never coming back sa bahay ng friend ko was never an option to me before, that feeling na I was really hypnotized. Now I am 20 already, and last January 11, I had a drink with my fellow SK kagawads at the house of our colleague, and his brother sexually harassed me, I can still feel how he dampi his mouth at the back of my neck and would signal me with sexual hand signs discreetly. That incident triggered and freshened everything that had happened to me when I was regularly raped. I tried to open up to my fellow gay friend about it and he said baka not in the mood daw ako, I feel like I was stabbed and silenced. Ang hirap maging bading tapos ma sexually harassed ka and rape because people will not believe in you because of the stereotypes that has labeled gay persons to be. That is why pinili ko nalang maging silent, and I downloaded this app to vent out since I feel like I can no longer trust everyone in my circle.

I hooked up with a guy who I didn't know had a girlfriend. I told the girl but now she's harassing me.,"Almost 2 months ago, I met a guy who I thought was cute, so I decided to ask if he was single, he said yes so, I asked for his socials and he gave it to me. Mind you, his friends were with him and they saw and heard everything that went down. The next day, I decided to ask him out on a date and again, he said yes. I had no intentions for anything to happen, I didn't really like him in the first place and just thought he was attractive. I won't go into details for privacy purposes, but something did end up happening between us which I soon regretted. I already had plans of ghosting him / ending things even before finding out that he had a girlfriend.

When I did find out, I immediately blocked him and told his girlfriend using an anonymous spam account since I didn't really want my name to be involved in something like that. But I did give proof and the girl eventually believed me even though the guy kept denying everything, she said that she was going to break up with him and even thanked me for telling her. That was months ago, and I thought that the situation was already done and over with, so I moved on with my life and forgot about the guy when all of a sudden, a month later, I find out that the girl has been messaging my friends and basically telling them that I hooked up with her boyfriend out of context. I decided to talk to her using my real social media account just so she would stop doing this, she started getting mad at me telling me that I was basically at fault, and that I was the one to blame for everything that happened, not her boyfriend who lied about being single in the first place. I tried talking to her and explaining what happened properly, but she started sending me pictures of myself, calling me ugly and slut shaming me. I stopped replying since there was really no point in talking to her anymore. She was silent again for weeks until I found out that she messaged my parents and told them in detail about how I hooked up with her boyfriend, leaving out the part where I didn't know that he had a girlfriend. I have very strict parents but they also know that I wouldn't do anything like that so when they found out, they were more in shock than mad at me. I explained everything to my parents, and they believed me more than her. We blocked her again, but this triggered her even more and she started messaging all of my siblings and even went as far as finding out my parent's phone number and calling them. She started telling them lies about how I have a very high body count and that I was the one who initiated everything that happened between me and her boyfriend. She even went as far as outing me as bisexual to my family.

Since then, we all blocked her and ignored everything that she said. We threatened to go to the police/barangay and file for cyber libel if she didn't stop harassing me. I want to post this on here because I'm starting to lose hope on what to do and what the best option is to get her to stop. She knows what school I go to and I'm genuinely scared of what she's capable of doing.

Am i being harassed or am i just OA,"So I was temporarily assigned to do fieldwork in a male dominated office department. Some of them are in there 40s and 50s. Some are close to my age (20s). They asked me basic information how old I am, where I live etc. I’m usually wary of these questions, but still I answered them since I thought they’re just being friendly and helping me to be comfortable in my new set up.

Pero kanina lang, mga 1 hour before uwian, mag isa na lang ako na girl na naiwan and I was interviewing/talking to someone to get familiar dun sa gagawin. Then someone kept asking me if single daw ba ako para daw malaman nung mga kasamahan nila para hindi na daw “dumamoves”. They kept asking and I didnt give an answer. I just laughed my way out of the conversation. Ang masama pa is yung superior(head
of dept) nakikitawa lang din. Buti na lang at nakafacemask dahil hindi na nila nakikita yung facial expression ko. And right before ako umuwi, yun parin ang topic and they “jokingly” told me na baka naman daw may nag aantay sakin or susundo pauwi.

I feel so uncomfortable to think na 2 days pa lang ako dun. Now Im being paranoid since I told them where I live, not exact address but the nearest landmark.  Hindi ko rin alam if sasabihin ko sa boss ko pero ayoko na palakihin pa. Dapat talaga 2 ang maassign, me and my supervisor kaso she’s still on self-quarantine and kaming dalawa lang sa department namin with the professional expertise to do the project.

My sexual harasser is thriving in the new neighborhood I live in and I want to expose him,"First off, we're both men.

I live in a new subdivision. Middle class.

Before we came here may FB group and group chat for upcoming residents. Met this dude who was interested in me and my bf, e me and my hubby sleeps with other men for fun sometimes, so we tried to arrange something for when we both live in the area.

Later on I found out that he has a longtime partner. So I asked, so will you bring your bf? He said, no this is a secret. Please don't tell that I do this on the side.

I got disgusted and mentally noted not the have sex with him because I hate cheating. Didn't tell him that tho but I stopped flirting on chat.

Fast forward to now we both live in the subdv. He said he will visit our house. I said I'm busy and my bf was away (he was at a gig). He insisted. To be polite I said sure. He hung out for a bit while I was working (my shift was on so I didn't want to entertain him fully) but we had convo. When he was about to leave, he slapped my ass. I was shocked, almost punched him. He said sorry.

That's when my bf and I stopped communicating with him. 

Now back to the group chat and the community. The dude who sexually harassed me has been slowly campaigning to be head of HOA. Sobrang PR nya. Nagpapainom. Buys drinks for midnight sessions. Now everyone (not me and my bf) calls him chairman.

Also somehow I feel ostracized in the group and the community. My posts get ignored for example. I feel like he badmouths me and my bf to his friends in the community.

I don't know what to do. I don't want to expose him but I just feel triggered whenever I see his posts and his success, I guess? What will happen to me in this community, in my dream house, if he succeeds in ostracizing us?",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/10o3o09/my_sexual_harasser_is_thriving_in_the_new/,t2_bdg6u,1674983956.0

Life has been better since leaving the NSFW community,"I said goodbye to the NSFW Reddit community long ago, and I must say, life has been more quiet and peaceful. I was into finding hookups, posting on my NSFW account pictures and videos, and loving the attention and exhibitionist aspect of hearing and watching me at my most vulnerable state. And in all honesty, I enjoyed exploring my sexuality & connecting with people of the same mindset about sex. But it was also mentally, socially, and physically draining. I’m sure it’s not like this for all people who are able to separate such things in their lives, but it was different with me. I yearned for that intimacy & I knew I was looking at the wrong place for that. Not to mention that the NSFW subreddits can get quite toxic—romanticizing kinks to real life non-consensual shit, the harassment I get, the insults I receive, the threats about my identity, when I did all that crap for free! No wonder we lost so many good redditors in the community. I get why they all left and never turned back. 

So, goodbye to that alternate persona. I used you as a means to escape what I should’ve faced long ago. It was fun, I met great people, but right now, it’s time to meet myself for who I am.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1anx0mp/life_has_been_better_since_leaving_the_nsfw/,t2_t7v4tnyoh,1707617767.0
Mahirap ma abused ng babae sa Pilipinas,"My ex (now colleague) still harasses me kahit na ilang beses na akong nag plead na layuan na nya at tigilan na nya ko. Ilang beses akong nagmamakaawa pero hindi nya marespeto yun. Lagi nya kong hinarass sa chat/text at in person. We broke up for almost 6 months and she still thinks na kami pa rin until now. Guarding me with my every move. 

She's confronting or harassing me because:

1. Nagmamakaawa siya na maging kami ulit
2. She keeps saying na ako yung sinungaling at manipulative. 
3. Manunumbat siya sa lahat ng nagawa nya for me
4. Tinatakot nya ko na mag suicide siya pag di ko siya kinausap. 

I've been enduring that cycle repeatedly week for 6 months. Masakit lang sa part ko na she's making things up para mag mukhang victim and the fact na nagmakaawa na ko sa kanya na to stop confronting me everytime may relapse sya. Tbh, sobrang draining sa mental health and I can't seek for help Kasi I'm a guy and ang hirap i prove na I am verbally, physically and psychologically abused.

I found out my gf had a fling with her own cousin,"**TW: Sexual harassment**

I’ll make this short. I learned that my gf had done it with her cousin before we were together after she told me that the [other night](https://www.toodat.com/community/Ifoundoutm/LoveLife/LkQWjnegRDdwZ1p0), her cousin tried doing it again with her by touching her inappropriately. I know it was a lot to process. Even now, I don't know how to feel. Anger. Disgust. Betrayal. I don’t know. I feel like she should have told me this earlier. I told some of my closest friends about it and I was just shocked by their response. They said it wasn’t that a big deal. One even said that he kissed his cousin before. It happens. But for me, it’s really weird since I see my cousins as my siblings.

Now whenever I see my gf’s cousin during their family reunions, I would think of what they have done in the past. Technically, she didn’t cheat on me but it kinda feels the same. Or am I overreacting? I’m now thinking about my future with her if it’s even possible.

Moral dilemma in my hobby community,"TW: Sexual Harassment.

Talagang when you belong in a community di maiiwasan ang issues no? From the smallest unit of Family to the entire social structure lahat may issues. Friends, Work, Church, other communities talagang andon ang issues. 

After ng pandemic medyo naghahanap ako ng communities kasi naging lonely ako. I wanted a new group of friends, not because my old friends suck ha, pero I wanted new experiences with other people. May mga sinalihan akong GC, Subreddit, at Discord channels para maging active man lang. Aside from this, I took new hobbies at eto yung panggagalingan ng dilemma ko. 

I tried cosplaying para medyo tumaas naman self confidence ko. It worked naman, pakapalan lang talaga ng mukha hahaha! Masasaktan ka lang if you let people who dislike your costume and shame you for it get to you. Not a small feat, pero considerigf na minority naman yung mga ganong tao sa community, madali siyang gawin kahit parang mahirap. Most of the PH cosplayers are very welcoming to everyone.

Anyway naging involved na ako sa community na to kasi sumaya ako eh, it was a positive experience for me. Pero syempre not everything is a field of flowers.

Lately parang dumarami yung mga tao na nanghaharass sa cosplayers. Akala nila kasi welcome na for them yung medyo revealing na costumes. Ano gagawin ng cosplayer kung medyo skimpy manamit gusto niya icosplay? It's not consent. Ask for permission kung gusto mo picturan sila in a sexualized manner, hindi yung parang they are letting you do it automatically kasi ganon costumes nila. Simple lang naman di ba, ask for consent. And if they say no, respect it.

Dito papasok dilemma: Karamihan ng mga harassers ngayon sa mga cosplayers nasa autism spectrum. They are essentially PWDs. Socially awkward people na di naman alam social cues ganon. One of the so called ""harassers"" have child trauma pa nga. Yet they harass cosplayers verbally and physically. 

So ano gagawin ng mga cosplayers? Ipopost mga nanghaharass online. May actions like sasabihan mga event organizers or mall security para alisin yung mga harassers. Mga concerned party naman ng harassers dedepensahan yung nangharass, saying na dapat di pumapatol sa PWD and stuff.

Di ako directly affected but I am concerned. Ayoko naman na may mababastos, karamihan pa sa mga to eh minors. Ayoko naman din na mabully either side, gets ko naman kasi.

Kasi action ng cosplayer na naharass is to post it sa social meda kahit na tingin ko mali yon, tapos reaction naman ng kamag-anak ng nanghaharass eh depensahan yung harasser which is mali din kasi parang enabling na yon.

Just want other people's opinion on this. Wala namang tama or mali for me. Though iba opinion ko sa kung ano tama or mali legally hahaha! Yun lang naman. Nakakabother na din kasi.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/16zw44r/moral_dilemma_in_my_hobby_community/,t2_y3rt4,1696447448.0

Buti pa ang mga lalaki di kailangan mag-alala kung anong mangyayari sa kanila habang nasa labas,"di nila kailangan mag-alala kung masyadong late na o delikado para maglakad o magcommute mag-isa. di nila kailangan mag-alala kung kailangan ba nila ng kasama para safe sila tuwing lalabas sila. di nila kailangan magalala tuwing naglalakad sila sa daan at magisip na baka sinusundan sila ng taong nasa likuran nila. di nila kailangan magalala tuwing may bibilhing panandalian sa gitna ng gabi at kayang-kaya nilang maglakad sa madilim na daan. di nila kailangan mag-alala na baka may sumipol at mangcatcall sa kanila na grupo ng mga kalalakihan tuwing lalabas sila.

wala lang, swerte niyo. Alam kong may mga kaso na harassment at sexual assault rin na nangyayari sa mga lalaki pero nakakaabala lang kasing isipin na inaalalahanin ko pa to. Hindi pa nga ko adult pero tuwing lumalabas ako nakatatak sa isip ko ang mga bagay na dapat gawin para maprotektahan ang sarili.

Sabi nga ng social sciences teacher ko sa SHS, manyak talaga ang mga lalaki, pag nakakakita ng legs o kahit anong revealing, pagnanasaan ka niya. Kaya dapat raw magsuot kaming mga babae ng covered.

Buti pa kayo.

Edit: obviously im not saying that literally \*\*\*all men\*\*\* in this world are out to get others. I know men get harassed too, i literally just said that.

My social sciene teacher was a messed up guy who said problematic things to us during class, ofc i dont agree with him, but it's people like him that make me feel sick to my stomach whenever i have intentions to even go outside for the littlest things. Siya yung tipo ng lalaki na tinutukoy kong kinatatakutan ng karamihan, hindi literal na lahat ng lalaki. Apologies for saying it like that, should've clarified some things first.

""but not all men-"" i know that, but i wouldn't make this post if a \*majority\* of men weren't the ones going after women and even other men. I'd have kept my fingers to myself and not have the thought to type this if it weren't so relevant.

Hindi niyo ba naiisip na, kung sino pa yung kadalasang biktima, sila pa yung mag-aadjust(ie. self-defense weapons and tips)? Imbes na turuan ang karamihan ng mga kalalakihan na huwag umatake ng iba at maging disenteng tao??!!???

My boyfriend's sister,"***MY SISTER'S BOYFRIEND***

Days ago, nag message sa akin boyfriend ng ate ko. He insisted na sa Viber kmi mag chat kasi nabubuksan ng ate ko yung fb nya. I thought he was planning a surprise para sa ate ko. Yun pala, ako ang na surprise.

Sabi nya may nag message request dw sa kanya sa fb. Someone sent him videos and pics of me, naked. Apparently, this same guy na nag send ng pics and vids ko was harassing me years ago. So yes, may nudes akong kumakalat at napunta sa bf ng ate ko.

At first, sabi nya tutulungan daw nya akong ma track kung sno yung nagsesend. Until his chats were getting weirder and weirder. He told me na umaga palang nakita nya na yung vids, pero around 3pm nya na sinabi sa akin about dito and he keeps sending me my vids and pics (meaning naka save na sa phone nya the whole day) tapos sinabihan nya pa ako na nalabasan daw sya. Wtf

Feeling ko parang na rape ako. Watching my vids without my consent. Plus nag jakol pa ang puta! Sabi pa nya di nya ako una namukhaan. Nalabasan na daw sya nung na realize nya na ako pala yung sa vid.

Worse pa kasi he was describing pa how loud I moan and super wet pa daw ako. Putangina. I fucking feel disgusted talaga.

I'm planning to tell my sister about this but idk how. Sa malayo ako nag tatrabaho and they're always together. Gusto kong kausapin ate ko in person but I don't want to see his fucking boyfriend.

Hi. New and obviously throwaway account for reasons you probably already know.

My (M32) wife (F26) recently attended their work Christmas/year-end party. She has been with this company for more than 5 months now. She asked to go back to work again since it's been a while since she stopped when she had our baby.

Naturally, my assumption was that it would be a typical corporate event and it would be how like usual corporate events go: there would be a program, food, some games, some fun dancing and performances, the usual stuff. I even bought my wife a sexy cosplay costume since she said there would be an ""outfit of the night"" sorts of award for the event. I was like, cool let's aim for that. I spent around 7000 for a really nice outfit and a professional makeup artist for her.

So, fast forward to the event night. Bawal daw ang non-employee, so obviously I was not able to come with her. Hinatid ko sya sa event place, with her costume and full make up on. The event was supposed to end ng 12 MN, so I was waiting for her outside the venue by around 11:15 PM.

When people started coming out of the venue, I spotted her swaying with her coworkers. They were loud and laughing about something. Then, she looked over to another group elsewhere and blew a kiss to someone and waved goodbye.

She saw me and she froze. For whatever reason, her coworkers gasp and one even put her hand in his mouth in an ""oh shiiiiittt"" manner. Then they slowly part wats with awkward goodbyes.

She approached me and hugged me. She tired to kiss me but I turned away.

""Baby, bakit"" she asked, as I can smell the stink of alcohol from her breath. In fact, I think I already smelled it even before she approached me. Their entire group is *amoy chico.*

Now, for context: I don't drink. Never had, and maybe never will. My wife used to be a heavy drinker, but gave it up when we got together. It was a mutual understanding and no one was forced to do anything. So, she knows that I would have problems with her getting wasted like this. She knows this is something I am not comfortable with. And she knew this way back when we started dating.

I would have let this go and maybe just have a talk about her about it later and not make a big deal about it, since *anjan na at wala nang magagawa pa*. But what irked me was that SHE KNEW ALL ALONG that this would be a ""wild"" party, and not a formal/fun corporate party like I thoguht all along and what she made me believe, but she intentionally kept that as a secret from me. Despite knowing it's something I may be uncomfortable with.

""Inuman pala yan,"" I said flatly. "" Bakit hindi mo sinabi sa akin?""

""Sorry na mahal,"" she said, still in a drunk voice. ""Alam ko kasing di ka papayag eh.""

""Yun naman pala eh."" I said, now doing my best not to shout at her in a pubic area. ""Pero ginawa mo parin.""

Silence.

""At sino yun?"" I asked. ""Bakit may flying kiss pa?""

She acted coy. ""Ha? Alin? Nagbabay lang ako, anong flying kiss?""

But I know what I saw and I'm sure I was not imagining things.

""Niloloko mo na ako Anna eh. "" (not her real name)

""Baliw ka ba"" she said with almost a laugh. ""Sabi nga sa'yo, wala yun.""

Another silence.

And then I noticed something that sent chills up on my spine.

Her chest foams are gone. Now again for context: her costume had a tank top-like style and too make her boobs look bigger than it is, we used chest pads.

But now it's gone. How can it be gone?

""Ano nangyari sa paddding mo?""

""Ha? Nalaglag lang, napasayaw kanina eh.""

""So asan?""

""Nalaglag nga diba."" this time she sounded like she was getting annoyed.

Another silence. Without a word, I just ushered her tto the car and we drove home.

We were silent the entire drive home. Had it only been her getting drunk, I can let it pass since even some events do offer light alcoholic drinks. But what bothers the shit out of me are these unexplained things: the flying kiss to someone, the ""*opps nahuli*"" reaction of her workmates, and the missing breast pads.

We got home and she collapsed to her bed. We still didn't talk. For almost an hour, I'm just lying down, getting consumed by my thoughts and all the overthinking happening in my head.

And then there was a sound. And another sound.

It was her phone. It was the Messenger tone. With how fast the tone was beeping, it seems like it took a while before it loaded new messages when it connected to our home Wi-Fi.

I don't know what got over me, but I grabbed her phone form her bag, exited the bedroom towards the living, and explored her phone. It was Messenger and it was form the group chat with her co-workers.

What I saw almost made me pass out, and at the same time, I  almost punched a hole through our concrete wall.

He coworkers were talking about what she did in the party.

First, she kissed this one guy in what seeemed to be a ""longest kiss"" challenge. In the video snet by one of her co-workers, she took one shot of a dirnk and then grabbed this guy and smothered his mouth. People counted.

One.

Two.

My heart sank with each count and each time she kiss that man. It's not *just* a kiss. It was a torrid kiss. *Talagang laplap ang ginawa niya.*

After a full minute, she let go of the guy, gave home one more quick smack on the lips, pushed him a little, and waved him bye. Then people cheered and she danced with the cheering crowd.

Just when I thought this is too much for me to handle, there was a second video. This time, it seemed to be one of those ""new hire"" stage challenges. They were chanting some dude's name and this one guy went on stage and sat on a chair. After the host asked for another female ""volunteer,"" eventually Anna was the one egged to go on stage. She willingly went. Again, the crowd cheered and aside from the one who took the video, I can see many more others taking a video for this exciting moment, whatever it is. Then the host cued for the music.

It was some kind of erotic sax music and to my shock, my wife started to walk to the guy in the chair in a seductive manner, danced sensually around him, **AND THEN OPENED HIS LEGS AND SAT ON HIS LAP.** She continued to give this guy a sensual lap danced, as people around cheered, screamed, and roared. She seemingly kissed him from his neck all the way to his face.

What happened next made me tear up and hold on to my chest in real, physical pain.

She removed her breast pads and threw it out. and she grabbed the hands of this dude and placed it inside her top, and she moved the guy's hands to fondle her breast.

At this moment, I was not able to control myself. I threw the phone so hard, it hit the wooden pillar of our stars with a loud bang. The phone literally broke in half. The bang was so loud one might mistake it for a gunshot.

And I just collapsed there holding my head, crying.

After a minute of maybe an hour (I already don't know at this point), our bedroom door opened and I heard footsteps approach. There was a pause. Perhaps she saw trhe dent on the stair, her broken phone, me cryiing, and was able to at least out the pieces together. I heard her voice, breaking:

""I...I can explain. I--""

""Leave.""

Silence.

I repated myself. ""Leave. Lumayas ka na.""

""Mahal naman--""

I erupted this time, and screamed at her.

WAG

MO

AKONG

MATAWAG TAWAG

NA

MAHAL

With a gasp, I screamed louder:

LAYAS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

She didn't move.

""Lalayas ka o ako mismo kakaladkad sa iyo?""

She didn't move an inch.

I pulled her by her hadn and this was when she started screaming. ""Ano ba taman na sinsasktan mo ako!""

""Hindi kita sinsaktan, pinapalayas kita.""

I pushed her out and locked her out. I went to our bedroom and there, I just let go. I went on a rampage, screaming, throwing things, destroying things, ripping clothes apart. I don't know how long I went with it before I got tired. I opened my phone and contacted some people.

I think I fell asleep crying or just *tulala*. When I woke up, Anna somehow found her way in and was sitting in the corner, looking at me, sobbing. I stood up, and she attempted to stop me by grabbing my leg, but I just shut the door in her face.

I grabbed my phone, my wallet, and my phone charger. I went out and my friend, who I contacted last night, was already waiting for me. I gave him a quick run-through of what happened and asked him to bring me to somewhere far, like Baguio or La Union. I also contacted my parents, where we left our baby for the meantime, to go out and do not accept calls from Anna no matter what. of course I told them what happened.

It has been two days since I left. I am staying in some transient here in Baguio and I bought some clothes and personal hygiene items. I don't know what to do. I am always checking in with my folks and my baby, and according to them, Anna has been calling and sending chats all day. I also hid my main SIM card and is using a temporary number for now. I uninstalled all my social media and messaging apps except Telegram, where I made a new account and talk and do video call with my parents.

To be honest, I don't know what would happen next at this point. I have no problem with money as I have multiple credit cards and a debit card.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/zh7j6t/my_wife_kissed_someone_and_gave_a_lap_dance_to/,t2_uvduq61v,1670617099.0
My life has been so liberating since I said goodbye to NSFW community ,I left an NSFW community almost two months ago and it feels so liberating since then. I had a hoe phase through NSFW chats only during my vulnerable times. I also did this to validate my feminity. There were many creepy men who harassed me in the chat inbox after they saw my explicit posts. I almost dived into hook-up culture but I realized it is harmful for my sexual and mental health. I was deeply shocked when I heard HIV cases in the Philippines are going higher and higher due to main reason: lack of sex education. I'm glad I still have my V-card which I am going to give it to my future lover. I don't want my parents to find out about this especially my father. My father might beat the shit out of me if he ever finds out his daughter becomes a hoe. I know my parents love me pero pakiramdam ko may kulang sa pagkatao ko.

[TW: SA] read a devastating news,"Please do NOT proceed if you are triggered by sexual abuse, harassment, rape.

[This is the news.](https://x.com/tvpatrol/status/1699376575798542391?s=46&t=ErEk6kPvfWsCmDB08uIGdQ)

I was having my lunchbreak in a coffee shop. Sobrang tuwa ko pa kasi kasama ko yung sonny angel ko and nagpipicture ako. Literally pipo pipo song inspired playlist yung tumutugtog.

Then I opened Twitter, and ‘yang balitang ‘yan yung bumungad sa akin. Natrigger pa ako lalo nung nabasa ko yung word na “paulit-ulit”.

My insides turned; I couldn’t think, and I couldn’t breathe. I was dumbfounded. If I wasn’t sitting down I probably would have dropped on the floor.

That moment I thanked that I’m now an adult, and that my childhood has passed.

Sobrang sahol at sobrang sakit. Paano pa kaya yung mismong biktima? Paano pa kaya yung magulang niya?

My high school bully is rotting in jail,"Back in my senior year of high school, I was a timid and shy girl. I often kept to myself and only associated with my close friends. Being the new kid in the block (yes, I transferred on my last year), I was targeted by a bunch of bullies. 

My first bully was a girl who belonged to the mean girls clique. She was undeniably pretty but her attitude and her brain were nowhere to be found. In other words, she was a total bimbo. 

She would forcefully take my friend’s homework and pass it as her own. She would crumple a bunch of paper and throw it at me for fun. 

When I finally had enough, I stood up for myself and told her to back off. Of course, her boyfriend at that time got offended and took it upon himself to make my life a living hell. 

So I, a female, became his personal punching bag. Everyday in my senior year, he would punch and harass me with hurtful words. I told my parents about it and they actually wanted to help me out but I told them the bullying would only get worse. 

After all, senior year was almost ending and I wanted this to be over…

So years have passed and life has been good to me. I was watching the television then when the news broke out: death due to hazing. I am familiar with the concept of hazing since I have my personal experience with it. What kept me hooked was that I saw the name of my bully as one of the suspects. 

I was ecstatic with my newfound discovery.  Of course, I was not delighted that a guy was killed; but of the fact that justice may have a chance and be served! The justice that was denied to me many years ago would finally be attained - may it be in the form of someone else's. 

I quickly went to his Facebook profile and gathered any intel that I could collect. I took screenshots of his admittance to the fraternity, their fraternity officers, and everything related to his frat. I compiled them all and sent it to the victim's mom's FB profile. I also sent it to the official page dedicated to the victim. I actually don't know whether the receipts I've sent were ever read but at least I did my part. 

Now, my high school bully is still rotting in jail with a non-bailable offense. The case is still ongoing and I pray that he (and his fellow perpetrators) would be locked up for good.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/15rr94r/my_high_school_bully_is_rotting_in_jail/,t2_8ofomoqx8,1692102356.0

""" I want to slice my face off""","Trigger wanting/Self Harm/Sexual Violation

""I want to slice my face off""

Was what I usually thought during my lowest low. There were times that I genuinely wanted to mutilate my face, that maybe if I did  that; random strangers wouldn't take pictures of me, that if I did that, I wouldn't get groped randomly, I wouldn't get cat called or followed by creepy weirdos on my way home.

Sexualizing boys is the norm, making light of being sexually harassed on the streets, especially if it was by girls. I understand that there are men out there who have never experienced being groped and  think that getting that attention is the best thing ever, but it's not. I hate the glorification of being sexually harassed as a guy, and I hate that people attribute it to my face. 

""ay gwapo ka kaya ganyan mga babae sayo""

""lucky mo naman, sana ako hinahawakan sa privates ng mga babae""

""haha, ganda mong lalake, yan tuloy pati matatandang lalaki nababading sayo""

These sentiments, although really nonchalant, really pile up whenever you're getting sexually harassed. No empathetic sentiments, no validation of your feelings, just pure envy, misunderstanding and glorification, and  if I do try to voice out, just a smidge of discontent, not even a full on arguement about how I truly feel, all I get  is:

""gusto ka na nga ng mga babae, nagrereklamo ka pa""

""sana all chickboy, maging proud ka na lang na sobrang gwapo mo na ginaganyan ka""

""buti ka pa, ako nga di ginaganyan e, wag ka na mag emote, tangapin mo na lang""

Not many people think that the  things they say stick with people, because these stuck with me to the point it dragged me down.  Is it really so lucky for me to get harassed as a child? is it really lucky for me to get groped and followed by creeeps? is it really so lucky for me to get raped for 2 years?

During the last two years of my highschool, when I was constantly violated  against my will, I would lean my back against the door, hoping that it was enough to keep the rapist from my safe space, and I would cry silently. I couldn't let anyone know how I felt, I couldn't let anyone see me  cry at all. Because ""men who cry are weak."" 

with the only constant thought "" I want to slice my face off""

Ofcourse, as much as I wanted to, as much as I held  the box cutter to my face, I couldn't do it. Multiple times I've brough it up to my face, and multiple times I felt it's cold grasp but  I couldn't bring myself to dig deeper. Silently, I would scream while holding the damn thing against my face, but I felt powerless, I couldn't even bring myself to cut the very thing plaguing my life. 

And it went on for a few more years until I eventually had enough and tried to end it all in 2020. 

Luckily I'm still alive, and it's all a few years ago already right? 

but;

As much as I claim that I've moved on, as much as I've claimed and lie to myself that everything is okay, that everything is done and everything is over; 

in truth its not. 

From time to time, I get nightmares. Nightmares of people raping me, night terrrors of people mutilating my still living body. I scream but no sound comes out. And whever I wake from these nightmares, The only comfort I have is to lay my back against the door, hoping to keep the imaginary monsters at bay.

And during those times as I stare into my dark room, reassuring myself that I'm safe, a thought resurfaces, a whisper carried by a phantom gust of wind;

""I want to slice my face off.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1akwkxd/i_want_to_slice_my_face_off/,t2_a3pd8jorv,1707287314.0
A redditor pretended to care about my issues and then ghosted me when he saw my pic.,"So, I wrote an offmychest post about my dad's abusive behavior. I just literally poured my heart out and I wanted to have a safe space to talk about my traumas. So here comes this redditor who DMed me and told me comforting stuff and that he was there to ""listen"" so we chatted and he was kinda fine up until he requested my telegram and incessantly wanted to exchange pics so I obliged.

He then blocked me on reddit and I confronted him about it and then he fuckin denied it and subsequently blocked me on TG.

You gotta be so fucked up in the head to message, manipulate and then ghost an already trauma-ridden redditor who was just MINDING HIS OWN GODDAMN BUSINESS trying to somehow find a place to vent about issues he's been suffering all his life. The thing is IT WAS NOT EVEN AN R4R POST.

My sister is buried in debt,"And now she’s crying every night to my mom (thru  video call - she doesn’t live with us)

she has credit card debts, loans from online applications, 5/6, plus luho nya sa shopee and lazada na naka installment

yung binigay ni mama na gold necklace sa kanya, naisangla na nya

ngayon every week may tumatawag sa telephone namin asking for her

my mama has helped her 4 years ago by paying off her cc debt with bdo, and just a month ago, my mama also paid off another one of her debts from a loaning app.

she has been applying for jobs online, to no avail.

as a younger sister, I don’t know why but I just can’t put myself in her shoes… 

we’ve been telling her to stop spending too much if all your luho is provided for by your cc… or stop using grab/ taxi, mag commute ka nalang (since province walang traffic) to which she replied na “ayoko mag commute ang ganda ng outfit ko”

if we do tell her these, she would say, “nag suffer ako nung nag breadwinner ako sa inyo, ako na naman ngayon” 

sinusumbat na din nya na yung mga libre nya samin before sa mga resto naka cc so kasali daw kami nakinabang sa kanya

just 3 months ago, nag singapore sya.
complete with the new ootds, expensive resto and hotel.

i really just can’t imagine— you’re buried in debt, but still spending too much— way beyond your means.

and now she’s crying every night to my mom. 

her debts, apparently, has been up to 500,000 and tho she’s paying minimum, the interest has been eating her up, not to mention loaning apps harassing her via call/ text. 

it came up to a point na hindi na sya makabili ng tubig/ dinner nya. 

yes, I do give her money occasionally, but I can’t provide for her as I am also saving for an international trip.

I don’t know what else to do. My mama is very anxious and couldn’t sleep properly. She’s planning to sell our unused residential lot but I talked her out of it.

UPDATE

naisangla na pala ni mama yung residential lot without me knowing so there’s that wala na ko magagawa",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/16cuk7z/my_sister_is_buried_in_debt/,t2_t7hh50ut,1694130293.0

Am I disrespectful if I start ignoring my ex’s mom?,"
My ex and I broke up last year, and it was a messy break up. He didn’t just cheat with me multiple times, I also found out na he kept harassing other girls. That’s the reason why I am so mad sa kaniya cause he knew how much I hate predators and he was doing it while weren’t together pala. After that break up, I decided to inform his mom regarding sa mga kagaguhang ginawa niya sa akin pati na rin sa ibang babae. Nag-away sila and ilang linggo rin din siyang hindi kinausap ng mom niya. Me and his mom kasi is close and open sa isa’t-isa. She considered me as her daughter and very supportive about sa relationship namin kaya noong nalaman niyang hiwalay kami nalungkot siya. Naawa rin ako kasi mom niya yung sorry nang sorry sa akin kahit sinabi ko namang hindi siya ang need mag-sorry kasi anak niya (ex ko) ang may ginawang masama. 

Even after break up, his mom would check up on me. Lagi niya akong kinakamusta ang kinausap. Dahil na rin maayos pakikisama ng mom niya sa akin, I still entertain her. I am a nursing student din kasi kaya minsan sa akin nagtatanong mom niya if masama pakiramdam. Ang problema kasi now is minsan pinapaniusapan ako ng mom niya if wala na raw bang pagasa and lagi ko namang sinasabi na ayaw ko na. I endured 3 years of disrespect and cheating, and deal breaker kasi talaga sa akin if I found out na harasser or may harassment allegation ang guy kaya ayun naging breaking point ko. Last Christmas nagkasakit mom ng ex ko and tinanong ako if pwede ko raw ba kausapin ex ko regarding sa sakit niya. I told her naman na need niyang mag-rely sa doctor and all I could give is support. Pero she kept of insisting na need namin magusap ng ex ko so inulit ko lang din sinabi ko na there’s no point naman at doctor need nilang pakinggan. Minsan uncomfortable din ako kasi icha-chat ako ng mom niya and mangangamusta sabay bibigyan ako ng update about sa ex ko even if hindi ko tinanong so I usually try to end the convo in a nice way. Recent na naging problem ko is nag-ask mom niya regarding remedy for edema which imI told her na maganda compression socks. Tapos my ex mom is pinipilit ako if pwede ko raw ba kausapin ex ko regarding sa socks and I told her naman na she could purchase anywhere. Pero ayun she kept on insisting na I should be talking to my ex so ako ginawa ko na lang is naghanap ako online na pwede niyang orderan, kaso pinipilit niya na mas ok if kami ng ex ko mag-usap. Tapos recently lang, my ex tried connecting with me. And ayun kinausap ko mom niya if ever pwede pakiusapan ex ko na ‘wag na ako guluhin. Despite that nauulit pa rin naman and nauulit pa rin yung pangungulit sa akin ng mom niya to reconnect with my ex. Mali ba kung iwasan ko na mom ng ex ko?

Psychologically abused men,"Timeline: is on my prev post

I had an ex and right now we're colleagues. The disturbing thing here is she verbally (most of the time) and physically (sometimes) harass me. It's not really good to my mental health since we're still a student and I do have some academic burden and personal/ social problems weighing on my head. As a guy it is really hard for me to defend or shout for help in this matter kasi she got a good public or social reputation and she's a girl. I can't leave my program because I don't want wanna ba delayed for a year because of my parents. 

 We broke up for almost 6 months now (we've been together for 1 to 2 months) and she still harass me everytime she heard me talking, being friends or eating out with an opposite sex. 

After our break up 6 months ago she asked me if maghahanap ba ko agad something like that. I confidently said to her na ""Hindi ako maghahanap kasi mag focus muna ako sa studies at sarili ko."" 

What I didn't said to her is I am fucked up. I'm so fucking drained to be in a relationship that time and up until now lalo na sa mga pinag gagawa nya. I know that I can't be flirting or being in a relationship right now because she fucked me up big time. 

After that break up I tried to focus on my work pero she's with me, we're colleagues so bantay sarado nya pa rin ako. Pag may nakakatabi or nakakausap lang akong babae hinaharass na nya ko sa chat saying mean and abusive words towards sakin. I still hold on what I said about not being in a relationship. I just wanna socialized or have a friend lang naman pero yun nga she's overstepping her boundaries and she doesn't respect me.

Awra situation is so triggering,"From a perspective of being sexually assaulted, multiple times. Seeing comments and judgements abt the situation is so triggering, and makes me feel unsafe, too much anger and anxiety.

I keep seeing people doubting, kinekwestyon yung kaibigan ni Awra na hinupuan, bakit daw hindi mag sampa ng kaso, bakit daw nananahimik. Bilang biktima, sobrang nakakatrigger yung mas may judgement pa sayo kaysa sa offender. Mas kinekwestyon ka pa, kung legit ba, na makakasira ka ng buhay ng iba; kaysa isipin paano naman kaming mga binastos, paano naman yung buhay namin, mental health namin, safety namin. Pag nabastos ka, di mo naman alam agad anong gagawain, anong sasabihin, anong reaction mo. Unang iisipin mo, “ay hindi naman siguro nya sinadya” o kaya “baka kasalanan ko din”, “di naman ganon kalala, nahawakan lang naman ako sa dibdib”. Dina-doubt mo na sarili mo, tapos makakakita ka pa na ikaw yung hinihusgahan, ikaw yung ginigisa, ikaw yung pinagppyestahan; bakit di ka magfile ng kaso, bakit di ka mag step forward bakit di ka magsalita. Alam nyo ba gaano kahirap magsumbong pag ganyang puro “hala sinungaling” nakikita mo. Sana yung concern na “masisira yung buhay ni kuya”, pareho din ng level sa concern sa mga binastos.

For Awra and the whole incident, naniniwala na pinagtanggol nya yung mga kaibigan nyang nabastos. Yung itsura nya sa vid na naghahabol e hindi itsura ng offended dahil nireject, yung gawain na mag habol at manakit kapag nirereject e gawain (mostly) ng mga straight men, kapag queer ka o lgbt (esp judging from Awra, di naman siguro sya mag aamok sa public place lalo’t public figure sya, sikat sya, magkakalat ka ba dahil lang sa tite) — pag parte ka ng lgbt, alam mong prone ka na magpagkaisahan. So I honestly believe na yung galit na nafefeel nya ay hindi dahil sa nareject sya. — by that, I appreciate that she stood up for her friends, she fought for them.

Yung nagleak na cctv footage, parang yung guy minamock sina Awra at jinojoke na ibababa nya pants nya. and if Awra did try to make a move, (not excusing harassment) its probably to make the guy feel what it feels like na manyakin, giving the energy back to him.

Anyway, this mightve been too long. Sobrang nakakatrigger lang, I was hoping na when i jump in reddit i see comforting opinions,, but it was the other way. Idk, believe what you want to, but victims and girls who had been assaulted, I know we appreciate and thank Awra for defending and speaking up against sexual harassment.

May idea ako on how to deal with unsolicited dick pics,"Idea lang and hindi ko rin sure if this can be useful but this is how I imagined it:

*guy suddenly sends a (poorly taken) 🍆 pic*

You: Grabe naman po pala ang isang *mention their name* 🫣🫣

*I’m imagining na they’ll take it as boosting their ego so kapag nagreact sila na parang proud sila sa nakakasukang etits nila, that’s when you drop the bomb*

You: Now that you’ve confirmed that you are ____ and this is your unsolicited dick pic, the next time that you do this again hintayin mo na lang na katukin ka sa bahay niyo for a court appearance regarding your harassment.

-

I’m not sure kung ano ‘yung pwede talaga ikaso but the important part is you get them to agree na they are the owner of that ugly dick para wala silang takas.

This bluff can only be used kung kakilala mo ‘yung tao and not just random peeps. Up to you though if gusto mo seryosohin na idala sa court.

Kapag random lang ‘yan you can ignore or laitin mo blatantly kasi mas importante sa karamihan ng lalaki ‘yung ego nila kesa sa level ng IQ nila hahahahahaha",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1axp9pn/may_idea_ako_on_how_to_deal_with_unsolicited_dick/,t2_k7kua7wy,1708655377.0
"At the age of 18, I realized I was actually groomed","TW: Pedophilia/grooming 

Hi. I'm 19 f and I just want this to get off my chest in this community. Please scroll up if you're not comfortable with this. 

I had my very first phone at the age of 11. Then my mom created an FB account for me and set my birth year 1995 instead of 2004 because I was too young to have my own FB account.

I was groomed at 12 by four men online who I believe they're 18+ dahil ang matured ng pag-iisip nila. One of them was 45 (he's even older than my father). Six years ago, a random guy added me to a Facebook group called Minecraft Bros. I loved Minecraft. That's where I met those men. They added me on FB probably because they are interested in me and started talking to me. I felt uncomfortable. I was also sexually harassed as well (This is actually the worst. He forced me to take off my clothes and take pictures of my naked body and send my nudes to him in messenger. Good thing I didn't do it). At 18, I realized they took advantage of me. Hindi ako masyado nag-reply sa mga messages nila kasi I felt uncomfortable nga. That dude who sexually harassed me was fucking gross. Gusto niya talaga ako manyakin. Several years later, I realized they took advantage of me. I was very vulnerable. When my father found out about this, he scolded me for adding suspicious strangers. He told me they're bad people. Afterwards, I blocked them. One of them even asked me to be his girlfriend and I'm glad I rejected him. 


Sa mga kabataan diyan, wag kayo basta magtiwala agad sa mga tao online. I don't want you guys to experience what I experienced when I was 12 coming from a victim of pedophilia.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/16xxnc3/at_the_age_of_18_i_realized_i_was_actually_groomed/,t2_vsc0koxo,1696255785.0
"This is so heartbreaking. Aunties, please just stop.","My wedding is coming at sa abroad gaganapin, and Ill stay with my foreign husband abroad. 

Nabansagan na akong feelingera, matapobre, walang modo at walang respeto ng mga elders just because I talked back when they kept on disrespecting me and insulting me. My god I cant wait to fly na talaga at move out. 

Trinetreat na akong blacksheep ng mga aunties when I called out their bullshits and made them to stop insulting and disrespecting me. Sa Pinas lang ba itong payo ng mga aunties na ""Dapat kasi di ka na sumagot sagot, kahit na masakit at iniinsulto ka na, tanggapin mo lang kasi suggestion lng naman yan, kasi malaking kasalanan ang sumasagot sagot sa mga matatanda. Karma yan.""

Respect even if you get disrespected dahil MAS MATANDA SILA. Bahala na't apak apakan ka kasi ""SUGGESTION"" daw iyan. Dapat daw nakaapak lang daw ang paa ko sa lupa kasi di pa nga ako nakakapunta sa labas, feeling high na daw ako at matapobre. Oh my gawd, ni wala ngang ibang nakakaalam na lalabas ako ng bansa even my own friends at mga tao lang sa bahay (nasa bahay kami ng auntie ko nakatira ) kasi ayaw ko ng issues 🤦‍♀️. Pasikreto na nga lang. 

Grabe verbal harassment ng auntie 1 ko na nasa abroad at napakahaba na ng mga messages niya patungkol dito. I didnt message back, pero last time napuno na ako dahil over the belt na mga sinasabi niya, at sinagot ko na talaga siya at blinocked.

Oh my god. They started counting down the things they did for my father and brother, and when I told I never asked for their help on my end because it is true. Jusko, sinabihan ba naman akong ""sino palang nagpakain sa iyo? sa pinadala ko sa papa mo? noong nakulong kuya mo, saan kayo tumakbo? Diba sa akin?""

I told her labas na ako diyan sa tinulong niya sa papa at sa kuya ko. Jusko. Hindi ko naman problema kung ang pinakain sa akin ng papa ko nung bata pa ako e kahit pa galing sa kaniya. Responsibilidad yan ng papa ko. At ilang beses ko pang inulit sa kaniya na kaya nga ako hindi nag-aask ng help sa kaniya EVER  kasi nakakahiya na dahil ang dami niya ng tinulungan sa kuya at papa ko. 

Context pala, I have an irresponsable father who is solely dependent on his sisters for EVERYTHING ever since kaya naman tingin na ng mga aunties e binili na nila kami. They act so holy kasi ""MATULUNGIN"" sila pero jusko ang verbal harassment.  Itong away away namin nagsimula nung magkawork ako this year, at nagstart mag help sa family, at binansagan na akong materialistic at feelingera dahil bumili lang ako ng mid-level phone ko for the first time for myself dahil never did I have one for my own self. Lahat give aways and hand me down phone. They also didnt like it when I never accepted their demands sa kung ano dapat ang kasal namin ng fiance ko kasi iba plano namin.

Just heartbreaking dahil aalis ako ng bansa this week to marry at ganito ang trato sa akin for the last three weeks sa bahay. My family is just silent about it, at wala man lang nagstood up for me kahit na witness nila ang conversation ng auntie 2 ko at HINDI ko siya tinalkback as what she claims and reports to auntie 1, sinabihan ko lang siya na hindi ganun ang guideline sa airport requirements when she demanded me to explain things, at ininsist niya na hindi daw ganun kasi BIR daw siya ( take note: matagal na siyang nakick out sa BIR) at ALAM NIYA DAW, at sabi ko iba naman kasi ho ang BIR at Immigration guidelines, at sinabihan niya na ako na daw ang magaling at matalino. 

Context ulit, my auntie 2 lives temporarily in the home of my auntie 1 with my family because she is running away from something. 

Context ulit, Im 22 female.

🥲

Ps.Thank you so much for the support and clearing up my mind everyone! 🥺❤️ Other than my fiance, only you people have really motivated me to not give up. Kahit alam kong ang gulo ng kwento ko, triny niyo pa ring intindihin. I wrote this purely from my heart at wala na akong pake sa pagsusulat ko kasi I was just really releasing whatever the pain I have in my heart kasi sobra sobra na ang break down ko recently because of my aunties sending me ill messages consistently and saying so many hurtful things straight to my face to the point na pag may tunog lang ng new whatsapp message notification , sobra na agad ang fear ko na baka si auntie iyon at sinendan na naman ako ng vulgar na mga salita. To be honest, I was already feeling so overwhelmed and felt na ang laki ng kasalanan ko and really questioned myself, but you gave me a clearer mind to just keep on and that I just need to establish peace with my own self by cutting toxic people from my life permanently kahit na elder relatives ko pa sila. 🙏",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/189hvj0/this_is_so_heartbreaking_aunties_please_just_stop/,t2_lvv1odog,1701565427.0
Men who are obsessed with Vhong Navarro's case give me the ick,"I have a few male coworkers na napansin ko lang, kapag nabi-bring up yung case ni Vhong, they're like OBSESSED with it and todo defend, all ""innocent until proven guilty!"" ""sabi ng kakilala ko mabait daw yan"" ""frame up lang yon"" sila which makes me feel very, I don't know...uncomfortable. Parang nag iba yung tingin ko sa kanila because of it.

Like fine gets ko na yes innoncent until proven guilty, but when it comes to SA/r*pe allegations, it's a very touchy subject for me, so people who are always quick to defend the accused muna instead of staying neutral gives me the ick, especially given our justice system.

I know so many people who have experienced harassment and abuse but don't report it because of the social stigma, the lack of time, money, resources or support. So talagang kapag sa ganyang cases I am more inclined to side with the victim or stay neutral talaga.

Bodyshaming vs Preference,"Had a friend's friend confess to me recently. She asked if I would go out with her, I politely and shyly declined and she asked why. Ayoko ibigay reason ko cuz it might offend her, pero she insisted. I answered she's not my type and apologized. She asked again ano ba type ko. Told her I like tall and slim women. She said ok, then we parted ways. Next day, I heard from my friend that she said exis na raw ako kasi f*t shamer daw. Wth??! Some of our mutuals asked me about it too ""Sabi ni ano shiname mo raw sya?"" Got really annoyed with that. I told them all straight with what happened and even drew comparisons para lang malinis name ko. I said if I wasn't taller than her or if di ako Chinito (she only dates foreigners) she wouldn't like me too. And that me preferring women whom are tall, slim, maputi, financially stable etc is just the same as her setting her own preferences and standards.

Bodyshaming is when you harass or discriminate someone cuz of their body, but when it comes to sexual or romantic aspects, people are ALLOWED to reject people based on their own PREFERENCES. Girls turn down guys for their looks or height, why can't guys do the same? It's MY preference. MY choice.

Nakakaasar lang na some people feel entitled to someone else's admiration or feelings. Being rejected in a workplace or community for one's race, social status, weight, etc is discrimination and is illegal, but romantically and sexually? That doesn't apply. For the people out there na di comfy magturn down due to sensitive reasons such as looks, weight, etc. Please know it's not immoral or illegal to do so AS LONG as you do it politely and respectfully. It only becomes improper if borderline insult na, pero if it's you just enforcing your freedom of choice, it's not.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/11al7yi/bodyshaming_vs_preference/,t2_pb234651,1677222586.0
MY ABUSIVE EX BOYFRIEND IS RUNNING FOR SK.,"trigger warning // mentions sexual harassment, rape and abusive relationship

I’m going to post this here kasi sobrang sama talaga ng loob ko ever since I (21F) saw several posters of my ex (22M) plastered all over our barangay and found out that he really was running for SK thru a friend of mine. Naiinis ako because hindi niya deserve. Hindi niya deserve maging SK Kagawad. Hindi niya deserve ang suporta na binibigay sa kanya ngayon ng mga taga-rito samin.

Every time that I see his stupid fucking face, nagagalit ako at naaalala ko kung paano niya ako trinato nung kami pa. From bullying me, physically, verbally and emotionally abusing me, and on top of that, sexually harassing and raping me, hindi niya talaga deserve maging SK Kagawad. Every time that I see his poster na naka-ngiti, I want to rip that poster and burn it. Worst of all, dahil maliit lang ang mundo, I see my facebook friends sharing the posts he uploaded while doing community service na ang caption ay “si (ex) ang SK ko! baka SK ko yan! serbisyong mabait at tapat!” and I can’t help but roll my eyes, dahil hindi naman totoo na mabait siya; and those same people are the ones na nag-push sa ex ko to sexually harass me for him to “be a real man and let go of celibacy”.

Your SK Kagawad fucking abused me throughout our 5-year relationship and here I am, two years later, still healing from the trauma he fucking left. Ang hirap lang, tangina. One minute I tell myself that I’m fine, the second I’m mad and crying dahil naalala ko lahat ng ginawa niya. Ang hirap lang kasi I remember speaking up about what he did to me, yet I ended up becoming the bad person dahil “mabait” at catechist siya sa simbahan – mas maraming naniniwala sa kanya, kesa sakin at hinding-hindi niya kayang gawin ang mga sinabi ko dahil anak siya ng Diyos, lol. Your SK Kagawad made me feel small, pakiramdam ko napaka-dumi kong tao sa mga pinaggagawa niya sakin throughout the whole duration of our relationship. Tangina, yang SK Kagawad niyo magaling mag-baliktad ng storya!

Your SK kagawad is a liar, abusive and rapist. He’s a fucking bastard, he doesn’t deserve that position. Kung siya ang future ng city na to o ng barangay na to, tangina.

I'm 19 years old and I'm about to become an adult in six months pero parang pang elementary pa rin yung suso ko. I have a round body with curves, a big butt, and thick thighs. I'm a B cup girlie and I didn't really care about my cup size before. Not until my lesbian crush rejected me probably because she's into slim and busty girls. Naiinsecure ako sobra sa girlfriend niya dahil mas malaki yung boobs niya kesa sa akin. Even if people compliment my boobs, my insecurities won't go away. I really want to have a boob job to obtain a D cup. My future SO will probably eventually leave me once he/she sees my boobs once we become intimate (I'm bi btw).

A confession page invalidated my post just because I put a title on it,"Kanina lang, I confessed to a page about someone bullying me at work. Two weeks ago, this guy was parroting me while I was talking to a trainer during an upskill session so I escalated their team since I wasn't able to see if it was him, but I'm at least 90% certain. Patola ako, I don't tolerate bullying anymore like I used to in high school kaya when someone does something childish like that, nagsusumbong agad ako. And the dude didn't stop, last week he was giving me the death stare dahil akala niya pinariringgan ko siya. I was talking about a viral cake post na mukhang kaldero, and he thought it was about him. So I titled my confession as ""Mukhang Kaldero"". 

Pero after a few hours of writing that confession, nagulat ako nang makita ko ang response ng admin saying ""this is not Wattpad. May title ka pa talaga ha.."" HA? Dahil lang ba girl ako and the bully was a guy, you think it's a Wattpad story? I'm not even a writer! Nag-confess lang ako how this borderline harassment issue has been going on for almost three weeks and about how this bully got his ego crushed because I wasn't giving in, I was escalating their team through and through. Kailangan ba dapat paiyak or paawa ang tono ng writings ko to make it believable and not a ""Wattpad-worthy"" story? Sorry naman kung di ako nakakaawa by tone ha. I'm a bit sassy kasi irl and siguro nag-reflect yung attitude ko sa post. Pero natatawa lang kasi ako na natamaan yung bully sa ""mukhang kaldero"" remark that he went through the lengths of unplugging the power cable of my PC during my team's meeting. Pagbalik ko sa station ko, yung power cable lang ang nakaangat so it wasn't accidental. Unfortunately, I was in the blind spot of our CCTV kaya nahihirapan ako magturo this time. But for my TL to be angry on my behalf, I knew it wasn't an accident. 

I partially blame Wattpad for this. Not the app itself but mostly whatever the hell influences the ""harassment = crush/nagpapapansin"" trope. And to those admins of a certain confession page, you're fcked up in the head kung sa tingin nyo nakakakilig and Wattpad-worthy ang workplace harassment.

Ang hirap maging babae,"Hello everyone, it's been months, delayed nanaman period ko, I have PCOS and naiiyak ako everytime naiisip ko na baka mahirapan ako bigyan ng anak yung partner ko. I'm in my 30s, aside sa PCOS, may struggle din ako na ibigay sarili ko sa partner ko kasi victim ako ng sexu@l harassment by my father and uncle ko, I thank the universe na hindi na materialized yung mga gusto nilang gawin, pero that caused me trauma na takot ako sa sex. 

I know, my partner is frustrated pero nirerespeto pa rin ako. Year 2022, nagpa check ako sa OB at ayun ang dami question ng OB ko, na baka buntis ako kaya delayed ako, hanggang sa napaiyak ako sa pag explain na wala ngang nangyayaring penetration kasi takot ako. Pero sabi ko na ready na ako to conquer my fear and gusto ko ma manage na yung pcos ko. 

Ayun nga lang, after consultation hindi na ako bumalik kasi parang nasaktan ako sa sinabi ng secretary ng OB ko na, MATANDA KA NA TAPOS MAY CYST KA PA, napanghinaan ako ng loob, ganyan din lagi pressure sa akin ng mga ka work ko, na magsisisi ako pagdating ng panahon, hay, kung alam lang nila, huhu.

I took birth control pills as advised by the OB pero after 6 months irregular nanaman ako. Guys, gustuhin ko man magka anak at mawala yung trauma ko, hindi ko din talaga alam paano sisimulan, nauunahan talaga ako ng takot. Ngayon, I gained weight nanaman at bumalik hormonal acne ko.

Ewan ko, parang tingin ko i jjudge ako kahit saang clinic. Pagod na din talaga ako, pero guilty ako na hindi mabigyan ng anak yung partner ko.

I felt violated,"I am a member of the LGBTQ community and I identify as bisexual. I just had this awful experience nung nag-CR ako sa isa mga malalaking terminal diyan sa South. The CR was full and kailangan mo pang pumila para makaihi. I went to the next urinal once it became available. While I was peeing, I saw in my peripheral vision that the guy beside me was taking a peek at my dick while trying to play with his own. It was done not in a discreet manner but in such an obvious way. I felt fucking disgusted like in broad daylight talaga, in a public space full of people where everybody can scrutinize what someone is doing. I also realized that the effin’ divider is too low that anyone who’s taller than you can take a peek sa weiner mo. He was an old man probably in his 50s and that’s what made it all the more revolting. He probably was so deprived of sex that he couldn’t think of other ways to release. I don’t want to generalize but I know cruising (with consent) is very rampant sa community but damn, have some decency when you’re in public. Sa boyfriend ko, kung mabasa mo ‘to dito, you know what I felt nung kinuwento ko sayo ‘to so thanks for listening. Not everybody is into that kink, folks. Jeez.

Ex officemate na may mental health issues kuno pero narcissist,"We had this officemate na silent and introverted. Personally wala naman ako problems sa mga ganyan coz I, too minsan gusto rin mapag isa and ayaw makipag usap. 

There are just some instances na minsan maaaya namin siya mag lunch and to hang out. It’s okay to say No. We would understand. However she’s taking it seriously and said na bakit ini “special treatment” siya? Like she’s thinking that we see her as a “pathetic” person.

We apologized for how she felt kahit di ganon intentions namin. We tried to adjust. As days goes by, she herself sometimes trying to reach out and even opened about her personal life (boyfriend, nsfw etc) she even laughed at green jokes. We thought everythings getting better and maayos na. Until another lunch happened. There are just certain times na nasa culture na talaga ng pinoys na mag aya ng kumain, to hang out and uminom. Unfortunately, she took it negatively again until she resigned. 

Few days after, we received an incident report and filed for harrassment and bullying. Few people from the team got suspended bec of her report. Although investigation is on the process, we cant fully understand why she did that. Sasabihin nya inaanxiety siya because she was targeted by happy people? Saying people are backstabbing her kahit wala naman siya kinalaman sa conversation. Sexual harassment kasi pinipilit siya magkwento about her personal and sex life kahit siya kusa nag open?? Like wtf? Dont wanna invalidate but never namin siya pinilit makipag socialize and now you’re the victim? Wow. 

Felt bad for the people who got suspended bec of this shit. They have families to provide and to
feed pero kupal ka at sinira mo.

"29 F, went to a massage spa and was given a male therapist","Last night, I took a stroll around my condo's vicinity and napansin ko ulit ung massage spa above the convenience store. Curious na talaga ako this time, so I decided to give it a try, despite regularly visiting other reputable spas like Nuat Thai.

Upon entering, I found the spa well-lit and aesthetically pleasing. Decent looking sya talaga. The staff seemed professional, and considering my fatigue from the week's Christmas preparations, I opted for a 2.5-hour session comprising a body scrub and aromatherapy Swedish Thai massage. By the way, every month nagpapamassage talaga ako sa mga reputable spas. 

There was a slight miscommunication at the counter kasi sabi ni ate , ""ok lang po sa inyo male masseur?"" I misunderstood the offer as a 'main masseur,' leading to an unintentional agreement. I said yes not knowing lalake pala ung therapist ko. The lady guided me sa bed ko. 

Unexpectedly, a gentleman entered the room to conduct the massage, and although I was initially surprised and uncomfortable, I managed to maintain composure. I inquired about the absence of a female masseuse, to which he clarified that I had agreed to a male masseur, and there were no female staff available. I told him na mali yung pagkakarinig ko but thats fine, tinuloy ko nalang kasi ang mas awkward sakin magbihis at umuwi and besides muka naman syang professional.  He's tall, medium built? tapos chinito and good looking. Soooobrang linis nyang tignan so nahiya rin talaga ako. He looks like more of a med tech or dr than a therapist 😭

During the scrub session, he asked me kindly about scrubbing my breasts "" hi maam, pwede ko po ba imassage dito?"", which I declined firmly. 

After scrub, naligo na ako and the massage continued. He put a lot of oil on my legs and thighs. He massaged my butt cheeks pero thats fine kasi other therapists did that to me as well. I just find it normal sa massage parlors. However, when he asked me na tumihaya, since nakaclose ung eyes ko, di ko napansin at tumama ung kamay ko sa bird nya 😭. Naramdaman ko yung tigas beh. Sure akong bird nya yun kasi nung dumilat ako nakatayo sya banda sa tapat ng right hand ko eh. And ofcourse, nakakapa nako ng hard c0ck noon so I have an idea. 

Anyway, minassage na nya ung thighs ko and I feel like tumatama ung fingers or hands nya sa cheeks ng kipay ko 😭 Hinahaplos nya from thigh to singit, medyo bumubuka ung flower ko nakakaloka. And then he proceeded sa pagpatong sa bed ko, he put my legs on his shoulders wtf and hawak nya both hands kong napaka lamig dahil sa nerbyos hahahaha. First time ko maranasan ung ganung stretch position sa massage, parang titirahin lang ako??? 😭 Grabe yung kaba ko pero buti hindi natuloy, walang nangyari. Very sensual lang ung massage for the whole 2.5 hrs pero walang direct hawakan na naganap. 

After the massage, it was 2am na and I caught him smiling sa may counter na parang nagpipigil ng kilig! parang malayo ang tingin na nagdadaydream ba 😭 Then he said ""maam kayo palang po ung female na namassage ko.. "" I dont know how to react to that. lol. Umalis nalang ako and then pag uwi mo I felt so horny about what happened 😭

This encounter left me feeling a mix of surprise and curiosity. Gusto kong ishare para malaman nyo POV ng isang babaeng may experience (with exes only) at walang experience sa mga gantong stuff, kahit fubu di ko rin naranasan. While I didn't feel harassed since gusto ko rin naman and tinuloy ko, the experience was certainly unconventional and flirtatious in nature. It was an unexpected journey filled with tension and unexpected sensations.

Nacurious tuloy ako, maybe this is the excitement people feel when doing something with their fubus or strangers they meet in club? 


Ayun lang. I enjoyed it. I dont want to go back there pero theres part of me na gustong matikman si kuya pogi. Char!

I never told anybody of about this, sad to say wala akong friend na open sa mga gantong topics. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/18sncqs/29_f_went_to_a_massage_spa_and_was_given_a_male/,t2_vioeimkq,1703745557.0
I'm a straight man and a gay kissed me,"TW: Sexual Harassment

So I was at a party. To cut things short, I was wasted as hell and was taken to my home by my friend's gay friend. 

I was drunk not stupid that night and I was still aware but barely had the mobility. 

During the night I felt a lip touch my upper lip and I immediately realized he kissed me so I shoved him away and called my sister who was in the next room for help and she picked me up. 

I told him to go home but he had the audacity to insist to stay at my place but I insisted he go home so he did because I was scared what he might do next. 

I woke up tired and looked at the mirror. My sister asked why was there blood in my mouth, I checked the mirror and felt it and realized it was lipgloss and lipstick. I felt sick to my stomach realizing and remembering what happened. 

I've never realized that this is how trauma and sexual harassment felt like. No matter how many times I washed and wiped my lip, I can still feel the linger of lipgloss on it as if I can't remove the oily based texture. 

I told my best friend about this and he was saddened about what happened. I also told my friend who was the gay's friend about what happened and they should be careful. 

I chatted him about it and he was passive as hell. Disgusting human being and it was no use to rant about it to him because he was very insincere. 

I know it's just a kiss, a peck if you will but I honestly feel disgusting and find myself washing my lip every often to rid the ghostly linger of that oil based lipgloss. 

I feel hurt how this has happened to me and it shows how disgusting people can be. I mean I've taken care of many drunk girls who throw themselves at me at bars and I don't like kissing them when they're wasted cuz I feel sorry for them. Plus they smell like barf 🤮. 

Love my gay friends but that gay man was just disgusting as fuck.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/11szr3e/im_a_straight_man_and_a_gay_kissed_me/,t2_suya8ege,1678986039.0

How should I educate my sister about,"About harassment? specifically, on sexual harassment?

Pa'no nga ba? my sister is now 11, and bilang isang victim mahirap sa akin na mag open ng discussion about nito with her. Promise, I tried! pero fck sobrang hirap para sakin!! I got no help received noon, and the only 3 adults who knew then, brushes it off. Tapos ang p\*ta is still around us, that is in every family gatherings. Bottomline, I had to self medicate. if you would say na, dapat pumunta ako sa police no'n to seek help... tama, I should've!! pero wala eh, the 13yo me then did not know ano dapat gawin, and inasa sa 3 adults pano e-handle yon, unfortunately.

I want her to be educated on these, unlike me. Alam ko naman na this is taught sa school pero iba parin panatag ko if nakita ko talagang she will hear the talks about sexual harassments.

I was groped by a male teacher when I was 9 years old.,"I (M) experienced sexual harassment at 9 years old by a male teacher at the study area of my old school. It happened in front of his students and they all thought it was funny but I froze up. 

Since that day I felt very different, kinda “hypersexed” perhaps. Never forgot the incident but didn’t realize the full extent of the trauma it caused me until I was in my early 20s. 

The desire to find this teacher and pop bullets in his head until he falls to the ground and be left unrecognizable in his fucking casket never left me since the realization; I’ve had fantasies of ending his life in front of his family. I know this is something I should process in therapy but I’m just too far gone and have been way too angry at this point; I’ve had therapy for unrelated reasons but this was never addressed.

About the teacher: he is a known pervert and would tell stories of his perversion to his students. Has a wife and kids and it’s so fucking gut-wrenching thinking of what he could have done to them or many others. He’s still teaching today. I hope I never see him ever again, otherwise I might end up spending the rest of my life incarcerated.

Are men the problem of society?,"It's fun to see how people are quick to defend the opressed if they are women, children(though I am not entirely targeting this), and now LGBTQ+(idk if this is just LGBTQ+ but you get the point). I don't understand how our society has a presumption of guilt (auto blame) on men whenever there is an issue on opression. They've all built laws around it already, there laws protecting women from men, they are now making ways on giving LGBTQ+ equal rights with men and women and I am proud of both. But are we not forgetting something? I don't see laws protecting men from abuse. If there are then feel free to correct me but as far as I can see society is developing to protect people from us men. BUT are we not victims of abuse as well? I can't count theb times I have been harassed by some random gay while I was out, I don't think I was wearing provocative clothes nor do I wanted their attention but I was harassed on numerous occasions. What can I do? Just shrug it off and ""man up""? Napapagod na akong marinig sa mga tao na ""hayaan mo nalang"" everytime nakakaranas ako ng pang babastos mula sa mga bakla. AND I AM SICK OF IT!

AFAM DATING GONE WRONG,"Hi, I just wanna share my story and spread awareness to those who fantasize dating foreigners that they meet online.

I (F24) met this guy (M25) in Omegle. He was so sweet and lovely then we started to talking daily for the couple of weeks. He fell first and asked me to be his gf. I was hesitant pa kase nga LDR and its my first time to like a foreigner so I rejected him many times and until sa napa-Oo niya ako. Im his first gf, he never had any relationship whatsoever sa tanang buhay niya kaya siguro all out magmahal. Our relationship went smooth. It was so good to be true. May mga away pero nagkakabati naman. We played video games together, videocall almost 24/7 and update each other every chance of the day. I introduced him to most of my friends and proud pa sila kase nga nakabingwit daw ako ng afam lol. The relationship went on for almost 2 years.

Within those years, mas nakilala ko sya kahit na LDR kami. I learned that he has anger management issues, abandonment issues and he is possessive. I dont fix a damaged man, he needs therapist for that. It kinda ick me thinking kase baka ako pa maging punching bag niya. Slowly he showed his true colors and parang nawawalan na rin ako ng gana sa kanya. I cut off many friends for him kase nag ooverthink sya masyado. He doesnt have social media presence but he made socmed accounts tas ako lang friend niya so ang laman ng feed niya ay mga old posts ko then he made issues out of all those posts kahit na years ago pa yan. When we argue and galit na galit sya, he would call me names, curse at me and accuse of cheating with any of my friends. He kept pushing na pupunta sya dito sa Pilipinas pero ako yung nag hohold back sa kanya kase nga I kinda dont see him in my future anymore. I told him all my feelings na unti-unti na akong nafall out of love. He wanted me to stay kase baka magwork out pa raw, and I did. I tried to work the relationship with him but wala eh, my detachment game is just so strong. Mas mahal ko sarili ko kesa sa kanya. I even planned to live with him in his country, buti nalang di ko tinuloy kase baka uuwi akong nasa loob ng maleta😭. The last straw of my patience with him was when I went out with my bestfriend whom he knows about. Nag away kami and he started making up bullshit stories na nagchcheat ako.


 Potangina napaka faithful kong tao, ako yung niloloko sa mga ex ko pero di ko gets bat ganyan lagi yung mindset niya sakin. Binibigay ko naman lahat ng assurance na need niya, pati location ko kung san ako natratrack niya. Sent him all the updates as much as possible. It was too much for me to handle and nakipaghiwalay agad ako sa kanya. Di niya matanggap and he cant respect my decision na ayoko na. Thats when things went absolute berserk. Thats when he showed how psychotic and manipulative he is.

I cut off all the ways na macontact niya ako, blocked him in all social media accounts but he find his way to harass and force me to go back with him by spamming and harassing my friends.  He would tell my friends to this or that or else he'll blackmail them. He would spam them long ass messages and calls. He kept doing that for months. I got fed up kase sobrang nahihiya na ako sa pinagagawa niya. My friends and family have no idea of the whole relationship and shouldnt be involved. He twisted the stories and told people Im not close with na ako ang toxic. Ako ang villain sa buong storya. Within 5 months he harassed me thru messages but nakarestrict you chatbox namin. I dont reply to him anymore, hinahayaan ko nalang sya para atleast ako lang yung dinidisturbo niya. When he got fed up coz I was not bothered by how immature he is. He posted me on facebook and made up stories. Di ko parin pinapatulan. He made multiple facebook accounts para imessage ang relatives ko na nakatira sa malayo, he even made a fake account of me and messaged my guy friends pretending I'll send them private photos. Buti nalang inalert agad ako ng friends ko and they blocked the account right away. But he really sent my private pics to my 2 friends and they are willing to testify against him. He hacked my instagram account and use it to message my friends there. Naretrieve ko ito then found out he connected his facebook so naopen ko yung account niya. I found in his activity logs how he stalked all my relatives, my friends and people that I dont know of then he messaged them. Its fucking disgusting  how he really had to go thru all this when all he had to do is let go and move on. A fucking creep.

Now, all I thought tapos na si Satanas sa kagagohan niya. I received a letter from a local law office saying nanghingi lang daw ako ng pera then broke up with him. May settlement na money which I never asked from him. Its funny how he manipulated his words when Im the one who has more receipts and witnesses. Pinalabas niyang gold digger ako eh potangina niya, sya mismo nagpupumilit magbigay ng pera kahit ilang beses ko na dinecline. Sya ang mahilig magbigay ng kahit na ano, kahit di ko hinihingi tas ngayon gusto niyang bayaran ko lahat. I have aaalll the evidences sa lahat ng pinagagawa niya and to my friends who he harassed/involved will testify against him. I will also file a case/complaint,, siya ang kawawa. 


The mental and emotional torture and trauma he put me thru is immeasurable. I dont think I could even recover from this. You really cant trust anyone even tho matagal na kayong magkakilala, some people are so scary kung pano sila magbago in a split second or maybe I just didnt really know him in the first. I regret that 2 years of my life. I blamed myself na nangyari sakin to, I blamed everything to myself. I dont deserve this kind of trauma and problems and I know its wrong to say this but sana namatay nalang si gago. I cant continue living my life kung andyan sya hinihila ako pababa. Nagmahal lang naman ako pero ganto yung binigay sakin. Nakakaputangina. Never ko inexpect na dadating sa gantong point yung buhay ko and that I really dated the most manipulative, narcisssistic and horrible person I know. Dating nowadays is just so fucking scary.

There are people that saved me.,"TW.
Growing up, I have always wished to die early. Hi, I’m Louise, a teenager. I grew up with a not-so-happy but happy family; I grew up with a broken family. Both of my parents cheated, funny but I stopped believing at love because of their relationship. It was only me and my sister— or I just think so? My sister basically raised me, we had an eight year gap that created a wall between us, but me myself created a wall between us and my half little brother. I hated him for years, my father told me about him on my birthday! He promised to fix our family on that day but what did he say? He said, “Anak, may iba na akong pamilya. Mas kailangan ko silang unahin kasi mahal ko sila, nak.” That exact words came out of his mouth, I wrote it all down in my diary, seven years ago. I was hurt, so hurt. How could he say that he love that family? How about us? 

Me and my sister started a new life. We moved out, I moved on. There was this year that my Father was bugging me because he wants me to meet his son, well personally..? I don’t even want to see him and his son! I respectfully rejected saying I’m too busy with stuffs. Duh, I respect him. If I don’t respect someone, it means I don’t respect myself as a human being.

When I was 9, it’s an upside down. I was harassed by my favorite family member and told everyone that I liked it because I didn’t scream for help. After that, I lost my hope to live. 

My family is broken, got harassed, and more. I went through a lot to the point that I harm myself everyday. Mama, Papa, this is so disappointing to read that’s why I preferred putting it here. I want to k*ll myself because of everything that is happening to me and I thought I don’t deserve to live.

Years passed. 2023. I met those people who physically and mentally saved me. At first, ang hirap mag-tiwala, pero I did it. They all saw me at my worst but still stayed. We all went through ups and downs.

Si Koya ay isang professor/instructor sa civil engg sa top state university and I can't accept na andun pa rin siya nagtuturo and he's living a normal life. Ironic na very woke and righteous ang culture sa school na yun pero andun siya.

as someone na ilang beses na naka-experience ng sexual harassment mula pagkabata, i know how it feels to be invalidated at hindi kampihan. hindi maganda sa pakiramdam so i felt the need to stand up for them kasi mismo nanay nila, pinagmukha pa silang masama. sa dalawang babae naman na rin galing na ayaw nilang gumanti sa bunso nila kasi at the end ay sila rin ang mapapagalitan.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/186vmyk/batang_nanghihipo/,t2_or3g62pr,1701280638.0
Being Here Doesn’t Make Sense,"  
I find it funny when people and organizations show interest in you and take you out from your space of comfort, only to act like you’re a regrettable decision once they have you. I never asked to be born, but my parents brought me into this world only to tell me that they wish they didn’t have me, in every situation where things don’t turn out the way they want it to. I was hired by a huge multinational company but my officemates started attacking me indirectly from the second day. Outside, many PUVs won’t stop to allow me to ride because I’m fat. Most stores don’t have my size. If I ever get skinny again, I’ll be subjected to sexual harassment again.  I wonder why I can’t make a single cut to end it all.

Out neighborhood is changing and I think it’s for the worse.,"I just want to vent out my frustrations sa negative changes na nangyayari sa neighborhood namin. Medyo mahaba to pero I hope you can bear with my litte story.

Yung family namin is considered one of the “pioneer” families sa isang barangay dito sa City of Manila. They were one of the first land owners nung panahon na “imbakan” pa lang ng certain crop yung lugar. Growing up, kahit hindi gated community yung area namin, it felt really safe and peaceful. yung tipong kahit lumabas ka ng madaling araw, alam mong walang gagawa sa iyo ng masama. Everyone knows everyone and very “bayanihan” ng community. 

Then panahon ni Atienza and Lim, nagkaroon ng “clean up operations” ng mga informal settlers around Manila. There was a settlement near a storage/factory facility na malapit sa barangay namin  and pinaalis mga tao doon. Eto din yung time na yung mga “pioneer” families sa area namin ay either tumatanda na or nag migrate to a different country or province. So nagkaroon ng surplus na cheap rental properties sa area namin considering na di naman prime location yung barangay namin. So maraming “new families” na nanggaling sa mga settlers ang nag move in sa neighborhood namin and doon nagsimula na “gumulo” ang neighborhood namin.

Tumaas bigla cases ng akyat bahay sa area namin and hindi din naging safe ang family namin. Nanakawan kami ng valuable jewelries and yung ancestral home ng mga lola ko nanakawan din ng mga priced possession. Umabot sa point na we have to install CCTVs sa bahay namin and barbwires. May time din na my fucking cousin who was 16 yrs old at that time, got catcalled and sexually harassed na nag end up na they were forced to move for a couple of years kasi na trauma yung pinsan ko. Umabot sa point na nagpapunta kami ng police kasi our “new neighbors” kept harassing my parents over some issues about yung boarder ng bahay na inuupahan nila na naglalabas ng itak. After that incident, no one tried to fight us sa neighborhood kasi well-connected family namin so isang tawag lang may reresponde agad na police (alam ko this is low na gumamit ng connections pero we have to given the circumstances) and i guess stories spread fast.

Then nagkaroon ng war on drugs si Duts and biglang nasama neighborhood namin sa watchlist which na prove na may shabu cartel sa amin and it turns out KATABING BAHAY PA NAMIN yung source. 

Fast forward na now im 28(M) and my parents are old now, I barely recognize the people in my neighborhood. Puro tambay na sa bawat kanto, puro inuman, puro kalat at tae ng aso na ang streets and drugs. I’m just sad kasi this place was my childhood and sobrang nababoy na siya. Maybe im sounding a bit elitist pero kahit sino naman siguro ganito mararamdaman if you are in the same situation.

P.S. yung mga lumaki na dito sa neighborhood na kasabayan ko/childhood friends are actually running for barangay positions kasi they dont want to lose hope and gusto nila ibalik yung dating neighborhood namin pero as for me, I’m planning to move away na if the opportunity arises.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1aln9qe/out_neighborhood_is_changing_and_i_think_its_for/,t2_3rxyjaqd,1707366532.0
I(23F) have an officemate(30M) who has a crush on me and it's now getting creepy.,"At first binibigyan niya ako ng mga chocolates, snacks, paper rose sa desk ko. Nagthahank you naman ako pero di ko siya pinapaasa, ginagamit, falsely leading him into something. Then he asked if we can go out some time. Sabi ko hindi ako nakikipagdate sa officemate. I thought enough na yun para tumigil na siya. At some point tumigil nga, I guess that's better na rin. Then during our Christmas party, I didn't expect na regaluhan niya ako ng box filled with chocolates. After that may pasabi sabi pa siya na seryoso daw siya sakin. But then I said na I'm exclusively dating someone na (eventually naudlot pero di naman niya alam).

Tapos ngayon parang nanliligaw na naman. Ewan ko kung bakit mga ibang guys talaga kahit pa siguro may asawa na yung isang tao, magpapakita pa ng motibo. Now I think it's getting creepy kasi he's doing sketches of me. At first I think it's flattering pero dude what sets me off is he got a stolen picture of me when he accidentally saw me at a cafe. Nisketch niya yun and posted on his IG without asking for my permission, nalaman ko lang sa officemate ko who's mutuals with him. One time din he messaged me bagay sayo yang damit mo. Nagthank you naman ako. Pero sinundan niya ng whatever I wear daw ako padin pinakamaganda. I don't know if I'm overreacting or medyo creepy.

I guess from now on di ko na lang siya papansinin and hindi ko na lang siguro tanggapin kung may ibibigay man siya. Ayaw ko na palakihin pa to since magreresign naman na ako the next months. Block ko na lang din number niya after (binigay ko noon number ko for work related)

Dati nababaitan pa ako sa kanya e. Pero nung nawitness ko din pano siya sumagot sa HR director namin and sharing pics and sketches of me on social media without letting me know bruh red flag.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/10mcnmc/i23f_have_an_officemate30m_who_has_a_crush_on_me/,t2_tanjvbcf,1674795626.0
cut ties with toxic family members,"2 am thoughts, can't even fathom the trauma you have been silently dealing with for the past few years. You are too young to experience such harassment, if only we knew. Not every house talaga is home and safe. I forking wanna give u a hug and cry with you. If we only knew. Babasagin ko talaga mukha ng papa mo. Tangina talaga ng ibang lalaki lason, sana di nalang kayo nag-anak kung magiging irresponsible naman kayo and walang ambag sa growth ng mga anak niyo.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/xuqv43/cut_ties_with_toxic_family_members/,t2_fr7otja0,1664820581.0

Can't wait na mabyuda,"I met my ex when I was in my mid20s. I was stable sa job, may pera, walang direction ang buhay, malungkot. Bahay trabaho lang routine. Sya naman, he was gwapo and tall and was kinda mysterious type. He was also completely broke and jobless. Akong tatanga tanga at malandi, gora naman.


Anyway, lumandi, nabuntis agad agad. My mindset at the time was kelangan kong panindigan ang kasalanan at kalandian ko. I cannot stress my mom sa problem kong ito. I immediately left our house at tumira sa bahay ng pamilya ng lalakeng ito. Dahil wala naman foundation ang aming relasyon kundi landian, I had no idea what kind of person he was. Unti unti ko na lang nalaman syempre nung magkasama na kami sa bahay. We are the complete opposite. He cannot grasp yung idea na hindi ako masyadong sociable na person and often insults my introversion. My life turned upside down. Ako na sheltered, never naexpose sa violence at very lowkey person ay suddenly minumura mura, iniinsulto and being gaslighted na masyado daw ako sensitive sa mga biro. Mga birong nakakagago lang. Long story short, I was miserable but trapped because I was pregnant. Tiniis ko. Ako na buntis, araw araw pumapasok sa work, nakikipagsiksikan sa pnr trains habang yung isa nagaantay lang saken sa bahay, nagpapalaki ng bayag. As you can imagine, my aversion to sex was so severe that I refuse to kiss him. Pero lagi ako giniguilt trip makipagsex. It was disgusting. 


So ayun, I felt like I had no choice but to stay miserable dahil sa kagagahan at katangahan ko sa buhay, I stayed and even eventually married this guy. All because I feel dirty and I had this thinking na di kami pinagpapala ng Diyos dahil namumuhay kami na di legal. Gusto ko rin pareho kami surname ng anak ko. Major katangahan na naman, para kong sinintesyahan sarili ko sa pagpapatali sa ungas na lalakeng to. So throughout these years, nanatili syang jobless, verbally abusive, manipulative and gaslighting me all the time. Never nakatikim kahit isang petal ng bulaklak. Lagi ko din sinasaksak sa ulo ko na kasalanan ko lahat to kaya dapat kong panindigan. I tried to talk to him ng maraming beses on how miserable I was sa situation namin, on how he treats me, how he talks to me and him being jobless. Endless excuses at pagbabalikgtad ng story ginagawa nya na parang ang lumalabas lagi na kasalanan ko lahat. I was in hell pero patuloy ako nagtiis. The most disgusting part was the sex kasi I don't even see him as a man anymore ng matagal ng panahon. My family doesnt know. Wala ako pinagsasabihan kahit friends ko. 


7th year namin together, parang bibigay na utak ko. Natry ko na lahat to make it work. I begged, I cried, I was angry, I tried calm and encouraging, I tried to be kind, I was indifferent, I became a monster, walang nagwork. He was the same piece of shit and di nya inisip na magkakaron ako ng guts to finally leave his sorry ass. He made sure to insult and demean me every chance he gets to ensure na matrap na ko sa kanya forever, he even uses the offing himself card to blackmail me. Pero mahal pa rin ako ng Diyos. I just decided one day na I don't wanna be miserable anymore and I left. It wasnt fucking easy kasi may authorities involved because he resorted to harassment and threats. It was like a fucking circus show. So surreal, parang sa movies lang nangyayari. Not to mention yung effect nun sa anak ko. But damn, there was paradise on the other side. 


Leaving him was the best decision of my life. 


Fast forward to now, after mahigit dalawang taon, I barely think of him. I left my lines open to him in the hopes na maging decent na ama naman sya at magsustento, pero wala.


He doesn't even cross my mind na. Bigla ko lang naalala lahat kasi meron sya miss call nung isang araw pero wala namang message or anything. Papansin lang. 😂 Like eeeeeeeew. Kadiri. Nakakamangha may mga ganitong tao. Natatawa na lang ako na ewan. I was hoping sana na kung makareceive ako ng tawag about him is to know na malaya na ko legally. 😂 Sorry, ansama. Di ko kasi afford annulment.


Anyway, I am still recovering pero I have peace of mind. Freedom is the sweetest thing. 


P.S. 
Sa mga anti-Divorce peeps jan, I hate you all!
