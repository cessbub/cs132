tl;dr Boyfriend (25M) does not defend me (23F) when his friend personally attacks me on the basis of me not being an Andrew Tate fan,"My boyfriend has been best friends with this guy since they were 13. I met my boyfriend in early 2021 and we started dating within 2 months. He's a wonderful guy and is incredibly loving and caring, perhaps even more so than me. Shortly after we started our relationship, we went into lockdown and so our ""dates"" were limited to facetime calls. During one of these calls my boyfriend asked me if I could start any business what would it be. I didn't think about it too much because it was on the spot and I said jewellery. Long story short we made preparations to start a jewellery business together and we almost got to the stage of launching it. Then lockdown lifted and we got busy with work, personal committments and actually spending time together as a couple. The business was still brewing but due to its rushed planning, and life getting in the way, it became less of a priority.  
My boyfriend's best friend decided he would also start a jewellery business. He quotes Andrew Tate as his role model and despite that being a questionable resource in my opinion, his business has really kicked off and I respect that. However, he's made an effort to actively bully me because of my opinions. I have never brought Andrew Tate to the table in a conversation, because very frankly I dont know much about him and don't care to know. I'm not someone who picks role models and replicates their life, so I don't feel the need to follow everything the man has to say. The friend brings this up every time. Asks for my opinion on something then slams me for it. I have been told by him that our business didn't work because it is impossible to start a business with a woman (I actually did majority of the work as I am still studying and have more time on my hands while my partner works full time). That feminism is the reason why divorce rates are so high (my parents recently divorced due to domestic violence on my dad's part). That people who hate Andrew Tate hate themselves, are unattractive and unsuccessful. That my partner could have still been with his ex if he hadn't been such a simp (she cheated on him and bragged about it to his friends).  
I wouldn't normally care, but I have noticed that my boyfriend never has anything to say when any of this happens. I am always left to defend myself and my thoughts, which is fine until it starts to get personal. His silence makes me feel like he agrees with whats being said (although he denies this when I bring it up). It is so tiring having to argue with someone for no reason at all, and I feel so anxious hanging our with my boyfriend's friends. He always says he will say something next time, but this never happens, he just keeps his head down and waits for the conversation to change. How do I approach this in the future? Is this a red flag, or something I just have to deal with and let pass. They have been friends for so long, but I would expect my partner to put me before all that. Is that unreasonable?

(Updated as necessary) Available post flairs are:

* **Family**
* **Financial**
* **Friendship**
* **Interfaith**
* **Intimacy**
* **LDR** (Long-distance relationship. Locations required.)
* **Marriage**
* **No Strings Attached**
* **Post-Breakup Blues**
* **Romantic**
* **Single, NBSB/NGSB** (Currently unattached, No Boyfriend/No Girlfriend Since Birth)
* **Social Media/Online Drama** (e.g. followings, non-postings)
* **Three's A Crowd**
* **Torn Between Two Lovers**
* **Update** (Automatically locked for comments. Link to previous post is required. **Do not** use this flair if you *still* need advice.)
* **Work Romance**

&#x200B;

Also note the dedicated post flairs with **Trigger Warnings**:

* **Death** (e.g. loss, grieving, mourning)
* **Suicide, Self-harm** (i.e. ideations, mentions, attempts, completed)
* **Abuse** (used as an umbrella term for multiple issues. E.g. drug dependency, physical, emotional, sexual abuse, domestic violence, etc.)

If your submission contains explicit details, consider choosing one of these. Selecting any of these three flairs will automatically tag your post as NSFW. Please use them accordingly.

If your submission does not include explicit details but does mention distressing information, still tag them as NSFW but use one first ones mentioned above.
