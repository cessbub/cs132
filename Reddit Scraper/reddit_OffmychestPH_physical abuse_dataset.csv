I was physically abused my boyfriend (now my ex),"I‚Äôm 23 F and was physically abused by my ex last Feb 13. It was really bad, I was in pain all over my body and I had severe pain on head and scalp because of the punching and hair pulling I received. I couldn‚Äôt sleep the night after it happened because even with soft pillows masakit pa din. I had spent my Valentine‚Äôs Day in the hospital to get checked. I went to my usual doctor but she refused to see me after knowing my situation. She refused because she doesn‚Äôt want to get involved if ever magsampa ako ng kaso sa ex ko. I told her I‚Äôm not planning to and I just wanted to get checked kasi masakit talaga buong katawan ko but she still refused to get me checked and instead referred me to a general surgeon. There, I was interviewed again by another secretary and was asked why I was referred to their clinic. I gave her the referral and told her I wanted to get checked because I was physically abused. After hearing that, she proceeded to ask questions personal questions as to why I was physically abused. And not only her, even the surgeon asked me personal stuff. Idk if it‚Äôs part of their job to ask but it was really uncomfortable for me. I remember crying in the cr right after the consultation. I feel so embarrassed, so ashamed of the situation I‚Äôm in. I feel like people are judging me for being physically abused. The way people are treating me felt like it was my fault that I got myself physically abused. I was asked to get a ct scan of my brain because of head trauma injury. I was using my insurance so i went to the hmo cashier with the doctor‚Äôs referral. While processing, the cashier asked loudly why I had to get a brain plain bec apparently it was expensive and they wouldn‚Äôt easily approve it. There was a line behind me and i was embarrassed to say it out loud so iasked if i could write it instead. I wrote what my doctor wrote in his diagnosis, head trauma injury due to physical abuse.  The cashier seemed confused and asked me, ‚Äúwhat do you mean by physical abuse?‚Äù She then told me to write a full incident report, time date and what has happened to me. So, I wrote there in detail what happened to me so that she‚Äôll process na my form and I could get a ct scan na. Is this really part of the protocol? Do the patient really have to do this? Because it was really uncomfortable for my part. I was physically in pain and it doesn‚Äôt help that they‚Äôre also stressing me out mentally, making me recall everything that happened just so it would be approved by my insurance. It‚Äôs so fucking stressful for the patient. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm grateful man na i get to go to the hospital to get treated but i didnt expect it to be this stressful. I even chose to go to this hospital, my university‚Äôs hospital, because I thought it would be more efficient than going to a public hospital. If only I knew na I would be rejected by my doctor, will be bombarded by personal questions, judged for being physically abused, and then forced to recall what happened to me, then I would‚Äôve just stayed home na lang even though sakit na kaayo akong lawas. I‚Äôm supposed to go back to the doctor today, but idk man, i dont feel like getting up and going back. I‚Äôm still in pain tho, masakit pa din igalaw ang katawon ko but agwantahon lang guro nako ni than go back.

why do Filipino famillies resort to physical abuse and humiliation whenever their child makes a mistake?,"I recently crashed my mom‚Äôs car around 1am cus I was going to another town to find something to eat. While it was raining hard I was driving casually with my highbeam turned on, suddenly I hit an ‚Äúschool-zone‚Äù signage pretty hard and it caused for the front of the car to be shattered. Regardless, I waited for my mom to get back from work so I can tell her ASAP. When she got back I told her directly that I recked her car and said all my apologies and told her I was willing to accept all consequences. She suddenly slapped me so hard that I fell to the floor. She probably bruised my whole body from smacking me with a broom stick for 1 hour straight and after that she had enough. While I was inside my room I overheard her talking to all of her friends and our relatives on how I am such a disappointment and basically degraded me to her friends.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/17mlwmo/why_do_filipino_famillies_resort_to_physical/,t2_63lybacdt,2023-11-03 11:28:58,67
"The girl I like has a girlfriend, and her girlfriend was physically abusing her.","The girl I like has a girlfriend, and her girlfriend was physically abusing her. She's also my friend from school, and I feel inlove with her. And yes I'm les. Nung 2021 kasi, nagkaroon sya ng gf na kaklase rin namin, it was fine with me, I'm actually happy for them. Not until magkwento sakin yung friend ko na gusto ko pa rin until now na sinasaktan daw sya ng gf nya physically kapag nagagalit yung gf nya, and nabanggit nya rin na yung gf nya ay pinagtatawanan sya sa harap ng mga kaibigan ng gf nya pag umiiyak sya. And habang kinukwento nya sakin to sobrang tumatayo yung balahibo ko to the point na hindi ko na alam kung anong sasabihin ko, I can't say naman na hiwalayan nya na kasi baka isipin nyang sinabi ko yon for my benefit, and first time ko lang din makaencounter ng ganong situation, kaya super hindi ko alam kung anong pwede kong sabihin para matulungan ko sya or dapat bang tulungan ko sya since friend ko naman sya eh. Hindi ko rin masabing hiwalayan nya kasi wala naman ako sa posisyon para sabihin sakanya yon and I know kung gano nya kamahal gf nya kaya tinitiis nya lahat ng bugbog sakanya. Ayaw nya ring may ibang makaalam sa family nilang dalawa. Any tips kung anong pwedeng sabihin or gawin or dapat ba wag na akong makielam since relationship naman nilang dalawa yon? 

to add lang din, nagkaroon pala yung gf nya ng bf sa work na pamilyadong tao, and ayaw nya ipakita sa friend ko yung cp nya kasi nga tinatago nya pero sya sa friend ko, kontrolado nya lahat ng social media nya na kahit mga kaklase nya for acad purposes ay pinagbabawalan nya makipag usap sa friend ko.

Na survive ko ang physical at emotional abuse today,"3 sampal at katakot takot na threats dahil sa walang humpay na pag iyak ko, sampalin ka ba naman eh. 

Para akong mababaliw kanina, hinihila, sinisiko, pinipilit mag salita, tinutulak. Para akong pinalong aso sa pag iyak  na naka suksok sa sulok tas pag hinahawakan lalong lumalakas ang iyak dahil nakakatakot na bawat hawak sayo may hagupit na kapalit. 

Hindi ko akalain na magagawa sakin ng SO (now ex) ko to. First time kong masaktan sa relationship at trauma is real. Dahil lang sa di ko masunod ang gusto nya kahit at risk ang health ko. 

Tinapos ko na at sana huling encounter na namin sa isa't Isa. Naiiyak ako pag naiisip ko yung ginawa nya. Mahal nya daw ako pero bakit ganun? Pag mamahal pa ba yun kung ganoon?

Namatay na yung tita ko who physically & emotionally abused me & my sister nung highschool kami pero wala akong naramdaman nung nawala sya.,"Napatawad ko na sya. Nakahingi pa nga sya ng tawad 2 months bago sya namatay. Sabi ko, wala na yun tita. Kalimutan mo na yun.  Totoong napatawad ko na sya pero traumatized pa rin ako pag may mga bagay na nakakapang trigger sa akin ng mga bad memories na iyon.

Unexpected ang death nya. Nasa Canada na ko ngayon. Nung nabalitaan ko yon, iyak ng iyak mama ko. Pero ako, wala. Blanko lang. Of course hindi ako masaya sa nangyari pero hindi rin naman ako nalungkot at naapektuhan.

I feel bad for feeling this way.

7 years din kaming nasa puder nya. May mga good memories naman pero bilang lang. Pag lang naka mood sya pag may pera sya that time. Pag wala, ayun, Princess Sarah at Ms. Minchin na ang atake.

Hindi ko masabi to sa mama ko kasi alam kong masasaktan sya. Kapatid nya yun at mahal nya. Kahit may nagawang ganun ang tita ko, sobrang buti ng mama ko at pinatawad nya.

Sabi ng mama kahit ano raw nagawang masama sa amin, wag na wag daw kaming hihiling ng ikakasama ng iba.

Gusto ko lang din sabihin na proud ako na sya ang mama ko. <3",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/19987qx/namatay_na_yung_tita_ko_who_physically/,t2_knsfqyyap,2024-01-18 05:24:41,279

Living with my abuser.,"#Trigger warning 
#I need help. 

#I married a monster.

Long post ahead. Please bare with me.  

I consider myself as a single mom of many kids. 

Isipin niyo na lahat ng word na pwede niyo ikabit sa word na abused. Ako yun. 

Sinasaktan niya ako if I refuse to have sex with him. Ang sabi niya ‚Äúresponsibilidad‚Äù ko daw yun bilang asawa. NO THAT‚ÄôS MARITAL RAPE kako. Meron pang isang bagay na gustong gusto niya ginagawa pero di ko na masasabi kasi it will be a give away. (Sexual and physical abuse). 
He cheated on me and I had STD not once, not twice‚Ä¶ I told him that it‚Äôs actually ground for annulment. Feeling ko ang dumi dumi ko. 

Ilan taon na ako lang ang bumuhay sa pamilya namin. (Economic abuse) 

Gina-gaslight niya ako and he used emotional manipulation. He one time said he‚Äôd kill himself dahil ayaw kong makipag sex sa kanya.  (Emotional abuse). 

To name a few. 

Ilang beses na akong nag attempt na makipag hiwalay sa kanya, but he knows I have a forgiving heart. Pero lahat my limit. Nauubos din tayo. 

We moved to a different city to start a new life. Ang alam ng mga friends ko hiwalay na kami. Which is partly true. Di ko lang sinabi na nagkabalikan kami kasi I used it as an excuse (not my proudest moment) I don‚Äôt like telling lies. Siguro napapansin nila na di ko sinasagot yung mga tanong nila. Para di na ako mag lie pa. 

It was so bad na umabot ako sa point that I almost kill myself. 2 tao lang nakakaalam nito. 

Few years ago he throw a fit kasi ayaw kong makipag sex sa kanya. I was so tired galing sa work tapos ako pa naglinis ng house. He was jobless. Pag di nagwo-work yung pagwawala niya he resorts to verbal abuse towards my kids. Hindi ko kinaya. I begged him to kill me para matapos na lahat ng paghihirap ko. Few months after that nagtino. So kala ko ok na. Nope. Nagkawork lang siya pero ganun pa din. Masaya kaming lahat sa bahay pag wala siya. Tahimik ang mundo. 

Couple of years ago I decided na ayaw ko na talaga. I told him to move out. But he didn‚Äôt. But for me hiwalay na kami. Pinaalis ko siya sa room. No physical contact di ko kinakausap nakablock sa lahat. I decided to take care of myself again. Nag message siya bigla using a different number, asking for sex. Like WTF! Seryoso? He began stalking my accounts. Called me a slut at may lalake daw ako. 

Last year he beat the shit out of me. Nag pa blotter ako, VAWC, pati sa Barangay. Walang nangyari. Sabi aalis na siya ng bahay pero nandito pa din. He threatens to kill me harm my family and friends at work. 

Madami siya kilala na influential na tao.

Violence Against Men,"TW: Physical Abuse

It just feels disappointing that men have no legal protection against any form of abuse or domestic violence. I (M31) had an ex gf who used to hurt me physically, and it occurred many times. Note that I did not cheat on her nor committed any grave offense against her. But everytime her emotions piled up, she used to hurt me physically, as in I got slaps on my face, arm, etc. 

After 9 months, I called it quits. I did not stand the abuse anymore. 

While women and children have legal protection, men are ought to just endure it and shut up, otherwise we will be viewed as weak ass pussies. Pardon the french.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/183less/violence_against_men/,t2_jhn2qk11,2023-11-25 22:54:38,10
Andrew Tate wannabe gets karma,"Sobrang cringe ko talaga sa sarili ko for having a long term relationship with a guy super fan ni Andrew tate. 

Matagal na kami no contact pero grabe yung mga narinig ko na stories tungkol sa kanya. Alam ko totoo kasi nung kami pa grabe talaga ugali niya. Napa therapy ako at nireport ko yan sa police dahil sa physical abuse.

Dami niyang nakakaputangina beliefs about women, men and society. At super deny pa siya na malala yung verbal, mental & almost physical abuse sa recent ex niya. Halos lahat ng ginawa ng ex ko sakin x2 mas malala na ginawa niya sa recent girl. Naawa ako sa girl, sana safe na siya now. 

ANG KARMA NIYA:

Nakita ko inexpose ng mga mutuals namin lahat ng kagaguhan niya sa ibang mga ex niya.

Yung latest na chika na narinig ko nahospital daw dahil sa anxiety dahil kinacancel na siya online. PAVICTIM PA SIYA.

Todo deny pa siya pero we all know the truth. Kawawa lahat ng babae na mamemeet niya. 

Ingat rin sa IG mga girls, dun siya kumukuha ng next ex niya. Kung gusto niyo ng name drop PM HAHA CHAR.

Alam ko nagchecheck yan sa reddit kung nacancel na rin siya dito. Kadire talaga.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/13rqy7z/andrew_tate_wannabe_gets_karma/,t2_s2qijldh,2023-05-26 03:32:12,50
I left the chat group.,"She got abusive partner. 
I‚Äôll make this short and simple. 
3 kami sa group namin, mag kakainigan nakami since highschool so more than a decade na. 
Si A meron siyang 2 naging partner and both may anak siya sa dalawa. 
Nag cheat siya sa unang partner niya kaya, pinili niya yung 2nd partner niya kasi nabuntis siya. 
Now yung 2nd partner niya is sinasaktan suya physically. 2x na siyang sinakal and yung last time sa labas pa ng apartment nila at kita ng lahat ng tao. 

The guy already have ‚Äòmental health issue‚Äô kuno pero ayaw naman patingin. Dati inuuntog niya lang sarili niya sa pader pag nag aaway sila. Tapos ngayon nananakit na siya. Hindi sinabi ng guy ano exact reason bat niya ginawa yun regardless di parin sapat na reason yun para manakit. 

Kaya lang sila nag kakaganyan dahil hirap sila financial. Stay at home si A kasi breastfeed pa ang baby nila. 

Going back sa guy, nagpaawa siya na kesyo sirang sira na daw siya saamin, habang siya wala daw siyang mapagsabihan kasi ayaw niya daw masira si A. 
Masira from what?? Kahit saan angle mo tignan maling manakit or mag resort sa physical. Babae pa naman baby nila di niya naisip na yung sinasaktan niya is nanay ng anak niya? 

Anyway, na guilty daw si A sabi niya sa group chat. 
Hindi nalang ako umimik kasi sobrang galit ako bigyan pa daw niya ng last chance. 

And that‚Äôs when i rant. Saying na ang galing magpaawa ng lalaki, nakuha kanya sa ganyan, remind him about our law may VAWC tayo baka gusto niya mag himas rehas, etc etc.. 

Sagot ni A ‚Äòmove on na tayo let‚Äôs give him last chance‚Äô 

My last chat before i leave sa GC 

‚ÄòPass, bat ko siya bibigyan ng chance? Ikaw lang magbibigay ng chance sakanya. Balitaan niyo nalang ako pag makikipag lamay ako sa burol mo‚Äô 

Galit ako,oo
Pero anong gusto nila? Makisama at magbulag bulagan? Hindi ba enabler ang tawag saakin pag hinahayaan ko lang? 

I left the GC kasi pagod na ako. Pagod na akong damayan siya tapos wala naman din siyang gagawin para ayusin situation niya. Di ko narin masikmuraan na makipag plastikan dun sa guy. 

Pagod na ako marinig ngawa niya sa GC tapos sasabihan kami na ‚Äòlet‚Äôs give him another chance‚Äô 

Damayan niyo naman ako! HAHAHA gusto ko lang talaga ilabas tong gigil ko.

Edit: just to add pala. Her mom is also victim of physical abuse. So nasaksihan niya yung pambugbog ng tatay niya. Her mom told her na iwan na yung guy the first time na sinaktan siya cuz her mom is right ‚Äòmauulit at mauulit yon. Magiging habit na nya‚Äô 

Sa sobrang trauma ni A natatakot siyang matulog kasi baka ano daw gawin sakanya or di niya siya magising. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/18g1j8t/i_left_the_chat_group/,t2_nnhhm0201,2023-12-12 03:17:15,130
That mf needs to rot in hell,"Di ko alam saan ako magsisimula.



My mom saw a video on Tiktok about a mother who made her daughter confess who was the first guy she slept with. My mom was playing around my sister who‚Äôs now 19 years of age. Tinanong nya sister ko. Palagi iniiba usapan hanggang sa sumabay ako at tinanong ko na rin sino nga ba. Bigla sya napaiyak tas natahimik kami ni Mama kasi joke lang naman yun. Pwedi naman di sya sumagot. Habang umiiyak, she confessed ‚Äúsi Papa‚Äù


She is not his biological daughter. Anak sya ni mama sa labas. Sila pa ni papa nun nagkaanak si mama sa half-sister ko. He would come home from work before and he would ask my mom for food kahit wala naman income mama ko nuon. Full time mother and wife sya. Some guy took a liking to my mom. They had a baby at eto na nga yung sister ko. This new guy took care of all of us kahit nga papa ko nakikikain sa mga pinamigay nya. May trabaho naman sya pero halos araw araw naglalasing or palagi nanlilibre sa barkada tapos kami na pamilya nya walang makain. Grabe hirap ng buhay namin dati. Mom‚Äôs affair didn‚Äôt last at lumayo si new guy. My father continued being a drug-addict for years, a rapist (nasabi dati ni mama na pinipilit sya makipag sex kahit ayaw ni mama) lahat ng bisyo napasukan nya. He even caught STD from sleeping with a gay person at naipasa nya sa mama ko. Naagapan namin agad and my mom
was treated. My siblings and I were physically abused bata pa lang kami. He only stopped nung nag college na ako. The long years of physical, mental and emotional abuse we got from him was beyond words I can describe. Once, he almost chopped off my entire left shoulder with a big axe. Di ko matandaan ano kasalanan ko nun kasi bawat galaw namin pinapagalitan kami ng kapatid ko. Ang di nya lang nagawa ay pagbuhatan ng kamay yung mama ko kasi palaban naman si mama lagi nya napapahiya si papa tuwing nag aaway sila. My mom couldn‚Äôt go to work kasi sakitin sya at hindi nakapagtapos ng pag aaral so mula nung nagkaanak sila ni papa, she left her job at di na bumalik. If only we had the choice to leave my father, tagal na sana namin ginawa. Kasi nga walang wala kami, kahit relatives namin hindi tumutulong. They would hear us crying as kids from being physically beaten by my dad and no one would intervene to stop him. 


Tinanong namin ni mama yung sister ko bakit hindi sya nagsumbong samin na ni-rape pala sya ng papa ko since she was not even 10 years old. Sabi nya tiniis nya daw lahat kasi he threatened her na papatayin kaming lahat pag nagsumbong sya. I don‚Äôt doubt that he could do this. Sa kahayupan nun lahat magagawa nya. My sister kept her mouth shut and continued to be raped for more than 5 years. He was never caught. Magaling sya magtago hindi nga yun nakulong not even once nung nag drugs pa sya. Natigil lang ang panggagahasa nya sa kapatid ko nung 2017 and in the next 2 years, inatake sa puso at namatay while in Manila for work. Taga Cebu kami.


He died and got away with his arseholery. My sister broke free from his abuse but she will forever carry her trauma for the rest of her life. The day he died, I was surprised I didn‚Äôt shed a single tear. I was relieved pa nga. I couldn‚Äôt explain why, eto pala yun. I‚Äôve always hated this man. Napakahayup nya para gawin yun sa bata‚Ä¶ sa kapatid ko. No way in hell would we pay a visit to him in the cemetery again. Ipagdasal nya sarili nya sa impyerno. My little brother still looks up to him. I feel like he should never know this. It will only break him. 



I don‚Äôt know how to navigate life from this point. My sister.. who I love so dearly, nababoy ng sarili kong ama for many many years. My mom and I can only cry and blame ourselves why we couldn‚Äôt save my sister. We failed her. I can never forgive myself for this and I wish that mf would die many times in hell and experience the hell he deserves.

Depression comes in and go sakin. Di ko alam kung kailan ako last na mawalan ng suicidal thoughts or kung kailan ako nagkaroon ng genuine interest sa mga bagay sa paligid ko. Di ko na maalala.

Escape.  
  
Pero ngayong ako na yung nasa position na yun, mahirap pala.  
  
Mas mahirap kasi di naman siya physically abusive. Most likely emotional abuse pero di rin ako sure.  
  
Napaka subtle. Baka hindi rin siya aware. Ewan.

my lola's friend caused someone's death.,"pa rant kasi parang ang hirap i-sink in yung mga nangyari. Mahaba 'to kaya please bear with me (pati na rin grammar ko, kasi indi ako magaling mag tagalog because I'm from Visayas)

So my Lola, (a teacher, retiring next year, and kapatid ng mismong Lola ko) has a friend which is a principal teacher sa isang public school dito samin. I met her many times before ‚Äî sa mga parties and dinner with subject teachers. Okay naman siya. She's nice and has good communication skills. I prefer her over sa 'bestfriend' ng lola ko na mala karen ang attitude.

Not until I heard sa radyo (2 days ago) na there's a maid. A 19 years old, who committed suicide. And I was shocked nung narinig ko name ng amo niya. It was my lola's friend.. the principal teacher. I thought nagkamali lang ako ng rinig.. but it was really her.

The girl committed suicide because she wanted to attend college but eto naman si misis principal.. she said awful things to her simply because she doesn't want the girl na mag-aral and umalis. She even threatened the girl na sisirain niya yung card niya in front of her and she will call the police to accuse her of things na nawawala sa bahay if talagang aalis siya.

And you know what's worse?

She cursed the victim, saying awful words directly at her na she will always be a maid and graduating college doesn't suit her, dahil belong daw siya sa bundok where her parents work as magsasaka.

I was stunned to hear this and akala ko baka gawa gawa lang ng mga witness but there's a video of it. A fucking video of them talking. I don't know kung nasan yung video but I heard sa radyo na they watched it‚Äî and they were so mad at the principal teacher for causing someone's death. Not because of physical abuse, but mentally, and emotional abuse.

At eto pa ha, her salary every month is 3k lang?? and yung cheap rice pa yung pinapakain sakanya. Minsan saging lang. Tapos sometimes she's asked to iron the clothes daw ng amo niya every 12AM-1AM like what the fuck? The principal teacher is fucking rich. Her husband and daughter are fucking lawyers yet ganyan yung trato sakanya?! how inhumane!!

The girl opened up to her boyfriend and messaged him na she will end things as she don't see any future na daw because of what misis principal told her. Her boyfriend rushed doon sa bahay where she's working. Her boyfriend found her hanging but she was still alive..

However, she didn't make it. When she was at the hospital, she was choking na daw which caused her death..


I don't know what and how to react.. but damn this is just so..

Hay, rest in peace.. shit the victim didn't deserve that : (((

Nakakalungkot talaga and I feel so sad sa nangyari. Sobrang naiinis ako kasi I used to admire this principal yet to know na eto yung nangyari? Gosh, she did not only kill the girl.. but the victim's dreams na maging isang ganap na teacher din and for her family.

Potangina talaga. I hope the family will get the justice they deserve : ((


EDIT: I apologized for using the word 'owner' instead of 'amo' pasensya na po talaga and thank you so much for the correction...

Hindi ko nakikita sarili ko na mabubuhay lagpas 40.,"I just want to get this off my chest. I've been depressed since 2017 and started medication nung 2021, but I eventually stopped since hindi na  gumagana yung gamot. Isa rin sa reason is akala ko okay na ako kahit hindi naman pala haha false hope lang pala. I grew up in a family where I experienced emotional and physical abuse. As the eldest daughter, I have been through a lot. An emotional punching bag ng parents or sometimes punching bag. Gumanda lang relationship ko sa parents ko nung nag-study abroad na ako, which is sagot naman ng parents. anyways, I used to self harm to the point na nakita na ng parents ko dahil ayaw nila ako ipagamot.

Isa sa issue ko is hindi ko nakikita sarili ko na magpakasal or have a long term relationship. I am a very driven person at ang pinaka main goal ko ata sa life ay yumaman and travel kung saan-saan. Freedom ba. Actually naisip ko na if I ever date someone again in the future parang reason lang 'to para magstay ng matagal sa mundo. Pero hindi ko talaga nakikita sarili ko na tatanda with someone or tatanda in general. Gusto ko lang umabot ng 40 or 45 and then I can pass away. I want to die in a place where I will find peace, hindi na ata mababago isip ko. kung mabago man edi mabuti pero now this is something im sure na ill do. I have been through a lot and ayoko na patagalin buhay ko, ipupush ko na mangyari mga goals ko or maabot ito. Once na nagawa ko lahat ng gusto ko then I can finally cross the bridge.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/17i6erc/hindi_ko_nakikita_sarili_ko_na_mabubuhay_lagpas_40/,t2_45p30sa7,2023-10-28 12:57:43,145

Abused,"Help your girlie out there, need ko lumipat urgently. It's been years na din and I'm very vocal sa physical abuse na ginagawa ng tatay ko ever since. And tonight was the worse, I don't know bat ako pinag-iinitan lately and I won't regret any impulsive  decision that I will made today. 

Just a minutes ago, binugbog ako ng tatay ko and was I was also hit below my head. Ramdam ko ang sakit sa katawan until now and I feel na magkakapasa to, I will take pics and magpapa medical agad ako tomorrow just in case na mag-file ako ng kaso. Do you know where can I get medical for this? Sa Para√±aque po near sucat. 

Also I need to move out urgently, and he's making me stress throughout my childhood and until now and inaabuso physically and emotionally. Di ko maigalaw ng maayos ang likod ko ngayon. 

I need peace. And I will move out. 

Do you also know a place where can I rent for 2000? Alabang sana near festival. Di ko alam kung kakayanin ko pa tumagal dito. And I also let my friends know about this matter just in case something happened to me tonight.

"My co-parent is a huge fucking piece of shit, and it took me three years to fully realize it.","Before I got into a relationship with my co-parent, I dated two other men who cheated on me and physically abused me. Though he didn't cheat on me, we still didn't work out because of his retroactive jealousy issues (my body count was a little higher than his), which then made him verbally abusive towards me. The emotional abuse got so bad that I resorted to self-harm, and all of this happened to me while I was in my first trimester of pregnancy. He also treated me like shit for getting pregnant and encouraged me to abort my son many times because it's bad for his career (as if he had any lol), and went as far as accusing me of making pikot because he comes from a political dynasty. After our failed engagement, I stayed away from dating because his words really cut deep, and I have completely lost my confidence in putting myself out there. During this time, I kept on blaming myself for all the shit he put me through, thinking that I deserved it because I chose to keep our son. I even told all my friends that he was the best partner I've ever had because unlike the others, he didn't cheat or physically harm me.

Thinking about it now, it was so fucking disgusting of me to rationalize what he did. I was a 22 year old girl then who was lost and suddenly plunged into parenthood, and instead of being kinder, he put me through so much. He shouted at me a lot in my own house, then called off our engagement on the sole reason that his brods think I'm a gold digger (idk where this came from bc he was basically unemployed for three months and I shouldered all his expenses then).

I got extra triggered today because he visited my home to meet my son, and he had the audacity to tell me I was not a good person. What a fucking piece of shit, I solely took care of my son for the past three years we were separated whilst he was busy chasing empty career promises of his brods. While he's sleeping sound, I was up taking care of my son then heading to work without sleep for 3 fucking years. Tapos ako pa yung hindi good person? Hahaha putang ina mo, T***. I hope you get what's coming to you, gago ka. Matapos ko lang 'tong masters ko, gago tatanggalin na talaga kita sa buhay namin ng anak ko.

I think what further solidified my long overdue anger is that I currently have a suitor now who is exerting so much effort for me, and is treating me so well. Despite his demanding schdule at work and in grad school, he visits me in a heartbeat when I need emotional support. Whatever free time he has, whether it be an hour or a day, he does his best to allot most of it for me. He treated me to nice dinners for no reason aside missing me. He really showed me that all my life, I settled for the bare minimum. Salamat na lang at hindi na ulit mangyayari 'yon, because I finally know what it's like to be loved. Whether we work out or not, I'm glad to have finally known my worth.

So TL;DR version: Tangina ng ex kong verbally abusive pati brods nyang makakapal ang mukha, and also that abuse isn't always cheating or physically beating. Often, it comes in the form of verbal and emotional abuse. Eitherway, we shouldn't settle for any when there are billions of people who are willing to give us so much more love.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1azyi8l/my_coparent_is_a_huge_fucking_piece_of_shit_and/,t2_ulxerfe3z,2024-02-26 04:49:00,6
It's my first time hearing my partner sing her heart out after 2 months,"Mahaba haba to, your choice if babasahin mo :)

I'm 22M and my partner's 21F, we're both living with my parents. Everything's all great, it felt like I'm living the dream. Parehong may savings, nabibili namin lahat ng mga gusto namin, and of course, nakakatulong din kami sa bills dito sa bahay. She was 19yrs old when we decided na mag live in na, given the fact na sobrang abusive sakanya ng mga tao sa bahay nila (verbal and physical abuse), nagka trauma and depression siya that time so I told her na whatever her decision, my family and I will welcome her sa house namin. We both earn 30k monthly since nasa parehong company lang kami.. 

But then, March 28, we lost our baby. She was 3 months pregnant at that time. She wanted to quit her job so I let her be, she needed time to grieve, to breathe, and to heal. I know I do too but, she's my first priority. It's very heart breaking BUT we can always make another one. That's when she started to be quiet. No words. No reactions. Barely eating. Ni hindi kami nag uusap ng matino, just pure presence is all that we have that time. Hindi siya lumalabas ng bahay. Hindi niya rin kinakausap mga friends niya and kahit sino dito sa bahay. She ignored us for 2 months. Some may say that she's unfair and that she never thought of how I would feel sa ginagawa niya. Na hindi lang siya ang nawalan.

Pero kahit na hindi siya nagsasalita, or kahit na hindi niya ako kinakausap.. Palagi niya akong inaalagaan. Nauuna siyang gumising sakin ng 7PM para gawan ako ng breakfast (gy shift ako), after that, papainitan niya ako ng tubig kasi hindi ako nakakaligo pag hindi maligamgam yung tubig. Pag break ko, may snacks na nakahanda sa table ko, and then pag lunch ko naman, hinahatiran niya ako ng niluto niya for me. Lahat ng foods na ginagawa niya for me, laging may sticky notes sa ilalim ng pinggan: ""Thank you so much"" ""I appreciate you"" ""Wait for me"" ""I hope it's spicy enough for you, di ko tinikman kasi baka it's too spicy for me"" ""Hipon, your favorite!"" ""With every bit of fiber in my body, I love you"", iilan lang yan sa mga nakalagay palagi sa note, never siyang nakalimot na iremind ako na kahit ganon siya sa ngayon, mahal na mahal niya ako't inaalala niya ako. 

Kanina after shift, habang naliligo siya, bigla akong naiyak kasi narinig ko siyang kumakanta. After 2 months. Paglabas niya ng CR, nagtataka siya kung bakit ako umiiyak. Niyakap ko lang siya ng mahigpit. She thanked me again and told me how much she loves me. While smiling. God, I love her so much.

(28F) Napakahirap growing up with an abusive father.,"The violent and sudden angry outbursts I witnessed since I was a child, yung mom ko battered wife due to his paranoia (napaka seloso), nakatikim kaming magkakapatid ng physical abuse kahit walang dahilan para ikagalit niya. Noon inisip ko tuwing ma tri-trigerred siya maging violent na sana mas mabuti pa walang ama kaysa ganoon, noong nilayasan namin siya ilang beses hindi na sana nakipag reconcile mom ko everytime na susuyin niya kami for the sake of not being called ""a broken family"". Eh di sana happy kami na wala siya sa buhay namin, may freedom from emotional harm at wala ng source of misery.

Mahirap especially as a babae ma re-realize mo na kaya pala na a-attract mo ay yung mga cheaters, uncaring, heartless partners kasi deep inside your subconscious yun ang alam mong ""love"" growing up.

Ang hirap magmahal ng magulang na nananakit pag nagalit.,"-TW: physical abuse- 

Hello, quite personal rant here. I just find it hard processing what I feel rn. My Dad kasi has a tendecy na maging physically abusive pag sobrang nagalit. He also has a short temper din. Before, back in 2021, we had a huge argument (I was 19/20 noon) and it ended up w him getting physical (dragged me back into the house by the arm; strangled me in attempt to shut me up). Looking back, I know I had a sharp tongue. Pero it was all pent up, all the frustration and anger I felt towards him just exploded at that time. Having him around the house when he gets back home from work (which is every 2 months; he works abroad) is like walking on eggshells. Things were said and done. I was young still, and I did not know how to process how I felt. I still don‚Äôt now but I try not to go head-to-head w him anymore. 

Pagkamagagalit na sya, at feeling ng Mom ko mamimisikal na sya, she tries to interfere. She would put herself in between me and my Dad, or tell both of us to stop. Walang ibang magawa si Mommy kasi baka siya naman ang saktan, o di kaya magmukmok si Dad at isipin wala syang kakampi. My Mom just tries to stay in between.

After the first time he got physical w me, I thought na mali yon. Na hindi ko responsibilidad ang reactions nya pag magagalit sya. My Mom said na he only got physical because I did that to him, ang managot etc. For a very long time, I believed this. Initially, I did not. I believed that no matter how angry you are, you wouldn‚Äôt get physical w anyone. Especially family. 

Pero ngayon, we just had an argument recently. Noong una hindi naman talaga sya ang may problema ako, sa Mom ko lang. But apparently, naapektuhan daw sya kasi di kami naguusap. Ang Dad ko, pag mangsisita, parang laging on a high horse. The way he talks nakakatick off talaga. I think that was what set me off, kasi ganon ang pagsita nya sakin habang nakain ako magisa. Di ko napigilan (at mali ko yon) na sabihin na bakit naman ganyan sya mangapproach, and that kay Mom ako may problem hindi sa kanya. Suddenly, malaki na ang hugot nya. Bakit daw parang ghost ko lang sila tratuhin, hindi na ako nagkkwento sa kanila, etc. Para saan pa para magkwento, kung ang comment nya lagi sobrang nakaka-off? When I went to Graphika noon, nangamusta. Sabi ko ok lang, tinanong may entrance fee raw ba. Di na lang ako sumagot kasi alam ko mag c-comment syang ‚ÄúMahal naman.‚Äù or makikita mong ij-judge ka nya sa facial reactions nya. What do you call comments like that? Sly comments or unnecessary side comments? Something like that. Laging may kuda na sobrang unnecessary. Nandoon sya sa generation na naninita ng pagbabago sa physical appearance (esp weight) at mga financial decisions ng iba. 

Siguro kaya malayo na rin loob ko sa kanya. Gets naman na nagt-try sya, sabi ng Mom ko. Bigyan lang daw ng time na magadjust kasi nga madalas namang wala sya dito sa lupa at laging nasa dagat for years already. Okay, pero hanggang kailan ang adjustment? Isang dekada na mahigit na ganyan ang set up namin, wala talaga. 

Ang hirap mo mahalin Dad. As a provider, thank you nandyan ka. Pero bilang tatay, nahihirapan akong mahalin ka. Hindi ko alam kung manifestation ba to ng trauma ko sayo. Pagpinapalo mo mga aso natin kasi sobrang ingay, naalala ko pagiging namimisikal mo. Hindi ka naman nagbago. All this time, I thought I was over what had happened between us before. Pero hindi, ang hirap mo pakisamahan. Sana hindi ka na lang naganak kung may anger issues ka.

It has been 13 years,"It has been 13 years since I told my parents that I was seeing then my boyfriend, now husband. It started like a normal day and then after breakfast I told my mother and stepfather I was seeing someone. I didn't expect just how extreme their reaction would be. I know they wouldn't be too happy because they were very strict. But I was 18, a legal adult who was leaving home for university in few short months so I thought that was enough for them to give some freedom. My mother went berserk. She yelled at me, cussed me out and called me a whore. She hurt me physically over and over. She threatened my life. My stepfather tried to play the nice guy by supposedly calming my mother. But I heard him egg her on. He asked to speak to my boyfriend to end our relationship. I was terribly frightened and helpless. Just after 9pm on that terrible day, I had to leave home and stay with a friend because my mother threatened more violence.

That was the start of their campaign of terror which lasted until the end of August when they eventually kicked me out of the house. I've always been abused in that house but they really ramped up the physical, mental and emotional abuse during those few weeks. I didn't even feel like human anymore towards the end. They've worn me down and I thought I was the worse person in the world. A dirty, good for nothing, whore of a daughter. 

Every year I feel the pain. As the months then the days approach to what I coined the anniversary, I am stuck in a cycle of reliving the pain. Some years I don't remember but when I close my eyes in the night I'm back in that moment. 

It has been 13 long years. I'm 31 now. I live in a nice house with the same man and have a good life. But every year, I feel like a helpless 18 year old again. My parents said I would understand their actions when I'm older. I'm still waiting for that day. The older I get, I feel more confused about their actions and their desire to hurt me. 

I feel angry because people in my world have moved on and expect me to do the same. I wish I can. I wish it doesn't hurt and that I no longer remember.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/158ams0/it_has_been_13_years/,t2_8epaki6q,2023-07-24 21:25:12,284

Then i said to my self ""Oh maybe kaya ganon ugali nya kasi ganon environment nya"". So basically parang inexcuse konadin yung mga ginagawa nya because of her problems. 

when i came home, i looked in the mirror, and i realized na i'm getting abused as well in my home by my parents Physically hit, and Mentally.

He was raised by loving parents,"The guy I am seeing is a gentleman and very respectful. It turns out, I found out during our date he grew up in a household with his loving parents who have a healthy marriage. 

I grew up in a household where my parents marriage is toxic af. My dad would scream, throw things, verbally, and physically abuse my mom every time they have a fight. My mom would scream back too if they have issues. Sobrang passive-aggressive rin. Yon tatay ko naninisi lagi and hr never owned up his mistakes. He also accuses my mom of cheating but he is the cheater; Andami niyang kabit and body counts during his marriage. Hence, I grew up thinking it was normal to meet a guy who is a toxic masculine and misogonyst.

Mr. Bumble is the exact opposite. Open-minded, gentleman, respectful, and dislikes sexism/misogony. I asked him how his parents raised him and he said he never saw his father physically and verbally attacking his mom. Kapag may issue both parents, tatahimik lang and pag-usapan nang maayos. His parents never hit him physically as well. He said he wants to be honest to show how his parents raised him and nakikita ko naman. He also thinks his actions are normal for a guy and sabi ko sa kanya in my case, nagugulat ako kasi nasanay nga ako sa toxic abusive household. 

Sabi nga ng mama ko, mag-asawa ako ng lalakeng hindi tulad sa papa ko. I am glad my brothers are the exact opposite of my dad and they are similar to the guy I am seeing as well. I know bare minimum lang yon lalakeng respectful and mabait but I really appreciate it that may ganitong lalake pa pala aside from my siblings.

pinalayas ko na si live in partner,"23F pinaalis ko na si live in partner 24M. Gusto ko lang ilabas talaga. 3 yrs kami, almost. After a yr of our relationship, I found out na yung kasama niya sa bahay ay mismong immediate family niya. He told me na nakiki-stay lang siya sa tita niya and his cousins. Di ako nagduda kasi kami lang palagi yung tao sa house pag napunta ako. Di rin kami masyado nalabas kwarto pag gabi na, pag nakikita ko naman yung ‚Äútita‚Äù niya parang normal lang na setup lang. Hence, kahit may ounce of doubt ako‚Ä¶ di ko na pinansin.

 Then, I became pregnant after a yr of our relationship. Doon ko lang nalaman na mismong fam niya yon. I feel betrayed knowing na yung mga nakakasama ko sa bahay ay mismong pamilya niya na. He told me na kaya niya raw di sinabi ay dahil may trauma siya sa fam niya and he didn‚Äôt grow up with them. After 3 months after I found out the truth‚Ä¶ doon ko naman nalaman na kambal pala sila nung isa niyang kapatid during check up. Y‚Äôall would say na bat du ako nagtatanong or di ko nahalata. I did ask him lagi abt his family plus yung bat di ko nahalata na kambal ay because di ako natingin sa mukha ng mga tao pag nahihiya ako. Also, palagi rin wala yung kakambal niya so di ko na napansin. Then, I feel betrayed AGAIN.

So lumala na yung trust issue ko. Mind you I was pregnant during this time. Pag nag aaway kami every month, nananakit na siya. Kada pigil sa braso ko ang higpit. Umaabot pa sa tinulak niya ako sa salamin nila sa kwarto. EVERY MONTH. Umabot na rin sa point na nasakal niya ako at 8 months pregnant tas di ako makahinga. Palagi siya nags-sorry after na parang akala mo fi siya aware sa sarili niya.

Our child came last year and binago niya naman. Nag adjust siya. Just this yr 3x kami na nag away na may physical abuse nanaman. Una pinukpok phone ko sa tuhod nagkaron ng malaking pasa. Sinampal ako‚Ä¶ and just recently, hinampas ulo ko. Hinigit ulo ko palikod to the point na tumunog spine ko. Also, hinagis ako sa kama. 

Also, he‚Äôs verbally abusive. Tatawagin akong bobo mag isip lagi or bobo lang pag napipikon siya sakin pag nag aaway kami. Ang hilig mag gaslight na baliw ako due to my reaction sa disrespect. 

I know I should‚Äôve left since day one. Di rin naman ako dependent sa kanya to begin with. But now, pinalayas ko na. I hope I am making the right decision. Naiisip ko lang na what if sa iba pa siya tumino, parang nakakainggit lang sa part ko.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/182ribw/pinalayas_ko_na_si_live_in_partner/,t2_o37iffjn0,2023-11-24 20:56:20,66

Willing ako maging 3rd party para maka alis sa isang abusive relationship si crush,"me(M) has come to know a certain woman(F) at work let's call her crush, we just started at this company at the same time and throughout this period she'd disclose that her live-in SO of 4 months is an abusive narcissist who gaslights her on the daily.  


she's cried a few times during our mandated breaks due to this, she'd show me her conversations with her SO and it's just a mess of insults and accusations and this cycle repeats nearly everyday, we actually can't talk about anything else unless she's calmed herself down but we can talk for 3 hours on the phone without really running out of things to talk about. I am not the only confidant crush has with her situation as several co-workers of varying genders has been informed about it.  


for context about kay crush, pretty much a textbook abuse victim, I asked her if she has been physically abused and she's said her SO hasn't hurt her physically (doubtful imo). she keeps coming back to her abuser like most abuse victims do. Also has 2 kids from different fathers, and her current SO is actually trying to get her to have a 3rd kid. pretty sad situation in 3rd world philippines.   


from what I know  of her current SO, a 20-ish year old(so young) jobless dude who uses weed but is ""managing"" a family business I have no information about that also brings no money, this guy was crush's +1 on the office team building and he would frequently ogle my other female co-workers unashamedly in front of crush.   


Right now me and crush are pretty close and intimate(no sex, yet), to the point of her saying she wishes she'd met me earlier or getting jealous if I pay attention to other female co-workers and we are aware that this is cheating. I don't feel any guilt towards the guy, but my feelings for crush isn't healthy too, I want crush for myself but I can't make her dreams(wants a happy family with kids) come true because I'm planning to get a vasectomy this year and i'm not budging on my childfree ways.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/14oq1um/willing_ako_maging_3rd_party_para_maka_alis_sa/,t2_lv2me,2023-07-02 22:44:37,0
karesperespeto padin ba ang mga sex workers??,"Hi guys I would like to open a topic since sobrang sama Ng loob ko and hoping somehow this story telling might help some girls or boys out there who suffer on the same circumstances as me. Hi I'm 18 yrs old and I'm a sex worker. 
 How did it begun?I was a streamer on an app when I was 16. Galing ako sa break up with my first boyfriend. I made the decision since he ask me if I wanted to do porn. I was very much offended at that time and somewhat close minded. But I know that time that my worth is more than that. Time has passed and there are lot of things in my mind but I decided to keep on going. I did streaming and luckily earn money to it. Wala kaming wifi nambuburaot lng ako sa mga viewers ko for load. Syempre while streaming Hindi maiiwasan ang mga nsfw offers like sending of pictures. I felt pressured dahil expectation Ng parents ko is Malaki sahod ko. That upset me and push my self to stream non stop to the point na Wala akong tulog and ung pahinga ko sa cp is 3 hrs. Nakaranas din ako Ng pananalita while streaming. Nababato ako Ng gamit and nasasampal. Maliit lng bahay namin understandable pero ung pananakit nila and pag sigaw is kind of out of the league na. I have trauma when it comes physical abuse. Ung mother ko I think have suffer from post partum and lagi syang Galit sakin napapalo ako even small things. I felt not normal at the times. Akala ko I'm a piece of shit lng walang silbi and all of that. Back to the story, I tried to have worth and so work not to mention I have epilepsy. Nakabili ako Ng mga bagay na gusto ko and totoo nga Minsan nakakasilaw Ang Pera. Nung walang Wala nako nag start ako mag benta Ng nudes. Nung nakita nila na may hawak akong Pera medyo naging Mabait sila . As a daughter to them I sometimes give money to them and buy groceries pero Hindi namn araw araw pasko mag mga times na nga nga tlag and so I decided to be a walker or prostitute. Pumasok ako sa ktv sa timog and doon ko nakita na may mga graduate pala Ng 4 yrs course and nag end as prostitute dahil sa hirap Ng Buhay. 
My problem is my mother and brot5dont respect me anymore. Ung kapatid Kong lalaki binubogbog nalng ako at inaambahan while ung mother ko sinasabihan ako Ng napakadumi ko daw. I'm afraid to be treated like a shit eldest child the way how my mother treated her eldest sister and my father being treated by his younger siblings . So my question is is being a sex worker still deserve to be respected? Sorry guys nalilito na Kasi ako I was thinking to do suicide SInce ung family ko is treating me like a shit habang tinutuwid ko ung sarili ko",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/z518ha/karesperespeto_padin_ba_ang_mga_sex_workers/,t2_p42o1i01,2022-11-26 15:22:07,231
Insecurities sa mga babae niya,"Totoo pala na kapag niloko ka, never ka makakamove on sa mga babae nya. Like anong nakita niya dun na wala ako? Nakikipagkompetensya ako sa kanila na I can do better. I can be sexier. I can be more adorable. I can do whatever she can do. Ako ba ang problema? I bleed emotionally and physically bec of these insecurities. I will never be enough to everyone. I feel like a toy, used and abused then disregard na lang after. Ang baboy. Feeling ko binaboy ako.

Sister bonds really make me envious,"I'm so fucking tired of being the emotional punching bag. Growing up, I have always let my older sister be, I never tried to create a bond with her kasi lagi niya akong sinasakit physically even though i am five years younger than her. I was a kid, and still inintindi ko actions niya as my older sister. I thought we'd eventually build a relationship just like any other sisters I know once we get older. But no, it just got worse. 

i just want to know where does her hatred of me stems from? I've never been one to fight back, sinusunod ko naman mga utos niya, i help her out when she needs help. Pero bakit? Bakit ang laki ng galit mo sakin, ate? She'd go home from school, see something na hindi ko naman kasalanan and still blame it on me. I know some of you will say, ""The oldest child has it harder"" but is that really a valid reason for her to literally verbally and sometimes physically abuse me? 

I've grown to just accept na ako yung emotional punching bag mo, pero sometimes it still hurts, you know? Especially kapag si Mama na ang nagtatanong kung bakit ba napakalaki ng galit niya sakin. 

What wrong did I ever do to you? Why do you treat me this way?",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/18ixyur/sister_bonds_really_make_me_envious/,t2_hxm1t57vw,2023-12-15 19:24:37,1
toxic household,"punyeta. 

punyetang buhay to, wala na kaming ginawang tama. gusto ko nalang mag suicide, gusto na namin mag suicide para lang maparamdam sa kanila na sumosobra na sila. kaso ang unfair bakit kailangan pa namin kunin at i sacrifice buhay namin just so they can realize na hindi na tama ginagawa nila? 

verbal abuse araw araw. naturingan kayong honor student pero sa mga simpleng gawaing bahay ang bobo niyo. napaka baboy nyo. laging over the belt. 7 years na kaming ganto, wala pa ring bago, gusto na naming sumagot at lumayas kaso mahirap lang kami, hindi pa namin kaya mabuhay mag isa. napaka unfair kasi lahat nalang sinusumbat samin, kami nagpapa aral sainyo, puro utang na loob putangina, kapalit naman unstable mental health at suicidal thoughts. 

kapatid ko nagbabayad ng kuryente, wifi, at tubig, pension naman ni mama sa renta ng bahay. pero kung makaasta sila parang wala talaga kaming ambag ni singko. 

nagbigay sila ng gadgets sa mga kapatid ko only to restrict them from using it. kailangan mo pang magmakaawa para lang makuha mo or magamit mo cellphone mo, sana hindi nalang sila nag bigay jusko. kasi ang gusto nila lagi silang may power over us, it has always been like this for 7 years na. nagka trabaho na kapatid ko which is good pero hindi pa rin nila ma appreciate kasi feeling nila nag mamalaki na, kapag hindi naman nag treat o tumulong sa gastusin sa bahay sasabihin nagsasarili. ganito kami lagi, hindi namin alam saan kami lulugar. lahat ng gagawin namin may nasasabi sila, nakaka drain na sa totoo lang. 

isang mali lang dito o isang sagot lang sa kanila, nagtthreat na sila agad na lumayas na kami. napaka manipulative and controlling. 

simpleng bagay lang na kinuha yung cellphone para magamit sa paggawa ng assignment sa school,¬† muntikan nang ma physical abuse. hindi mo alam kung mag aaral ka pa ba o ano. ayaw naman namin mag rebelde sa school kasi alam namin na kami rin ang mahihirapan in the future. kaya kahit ang hirap mag aral, tinitiis namin dahil ayaw naming ma jeopardize future namin, ganiyan kami ka practical. 

grabe pano pa ba namin titiisin tong gantong ka toxic na household, sa totoo lang gusto ko nang lumayas kaso alam kong hindi ko rin kakayanin at kawawa mga kapatid kong maiiwan. 

hindi kaya nila narerealize na yung mga verbal abuse na ginagawa nila sa amin atsaka pang gagaslight nakaka apekto sa mental health namin? kailangan pa ba talagang umabot sa itthreaten ko sila na bawiin buhay ko para lang magising sila na tao rin kami? may nararamdam rin kami?

I wish my sister an early death,"Pagod na pagod nako sa ate ko. I used to have a love-hate relationship with her pero now it‚Äôs just pure hatred. She was my first bully. Bata pa lang kami alam na ng lahat na malala talaga ugali nya, she used to be very physically abusive and now she‚Äôs more verbal but her being physical with me never stopped. I remember back then nung hindi ko na kinaya yung mga pananakit nya sakin nag sumbong ako sa my trusted adult pero nothing changed, instead she threatened me and called me ‚Äúsumbungera‚Äù. The ‚Äútrusted‚Äù adult didn‚Äôt even do much kasi miski sila mismo walang magawa sa ugali nya. She started providing for us kaya ngayon mas lumala na lalo ugali nya kasi whenever di nasusunod mga gusto nya, isusumbat nya lahat sakin. And the saddest part is i idolized her. I wish i could be as cool as her growing up kasi i guess you could say na i felt inferior besides her, i was insecure growing up because of her. She can carry herself to the point na pati mga matatanda kaya nyang sagutin and she‚Äôs an angel sa mga mata ng mga kaibigan nya or strangers. She was prettier than i was and mas matalino sya kesa sakin. That‚Äôs why i couldn‚Äôt stop myself from wanting to be like her. Kaya despite of endless abuse, i always defended her against the elders. Ang daming nag sasabi sakin na ‚Äúclose kayo ng ate mo naiinggit kamo ako‚Äù and i wish na sana ganyan nga yung case kasi for me, mas better na na hindi close kesa sa yung kapatid mo mismo yung bully mo. She always finds a way para ipahiya ako or to invalidate me and never even thought about apologizing. Never nya akong cinompliment for something that i worked hard for. Pero recently, i think i‚Äôm reaching my breaking point. I guess i‚Äôm not as submissive as i was tulad nung dati kasi the way she‚Äôs been treating me lately is more hostile than how it used too. She drove me to the point na yung suicide thoughts are being applied sa real life. Have tried many ways of ending myself pero would always wake up in bed alone, still in hell. Gustong gusto ko na umalis but i can‚Äôt kasi i‚Äôm a minor and tama nga sya, she‚Äôs my provider and wala ako ngayon kung wala sya. I‚Äôve tried many things like asking for help and finding a job for myself pero nothing works.

Im tired of being a nice guy.,"So many relationship ended up with me being second. I've met and dated many women, took most to dancing, courted and been in a relationship with a select few. Unfortunately all ended up leaving me(some even cheated). Gave them everything i could and loved them like their the only woman in the world. Learned how to do hair and makeup so i can relate. But sadly i learned the hard way that the phrase good guys always end up last is definitely true. Its hard to trust and go out there again. Sometimes i think it would be best for me to just be alone. They prefer someone that would just use and abuse them emotionally and physically. Now i wonder is there still a place for nice guys to get the girl and end up first.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/162yq2d/im_tired_of_being_a_nice_guy/,t2_dx7mzir0w,2023-08-28 02:57:23,89

I want to forgive my parents but it's hard to let go of resentment ,"I had a complicated childhood. Physically present father but emotionally absent and was physically abusive. A mother who saw my father's abusive tendencies but didn't do anything. I remember there was this one point where I was in 2nd grade and I hid my exam papers because I didn't pass their ""required grade"" which is a perfect score. My father choked me against the door yung type na nakaangat na ako from the floor while my mother watched and encouraged him to do so.

I hold great resentment towards them. My childhood was full of fear. I would go to school black and blue and no one gave a crap. In high school, they started throwing things at me. I wanted to get emancipated from them. They were controlling, abusive, and the bad memories weigh the good memories. I think, the only good memories I have of my childhood was when I wasn't with them. 

I'm currently 22 and still in uni but I don't live with them. I live with my aunt and uncle and I haven't experienced any beatings since I moved in with my aunt and uncle which was when I turned 18. I do however get verbal abuse. I get called names, they would swear at me, they would threaten my life, they would slut shame me, berate, say derogatory things and belittle me.

Recently, they threatened to have my foreigner boyfriend killed if I continue my relationship with him just because I snuck out on my birthday to see my boyfriend. They told me to break up with him but I didn't.

Ever since I visited them, I ignored all their calls. I ignore their texts. I respond a day later. I just want to graduate uni and gtfo of here. Fuck the Filipino saying na ""Parents mo pa rin sila, sila lang ang mga tao sa mundo na mamahalin ka unconditionally."" Fuck that. AKO ang magmamahal sa sarili ko unconditionally. They don't deserve whatever success that will come my way. Hindi naman sila ang nagpapaaral sa akin ever since pa before. Fuck utang na loob, bayad na bayad na ever since I was born. I'm not their retirement plan.

I have had enough of them. Fucking mentally unstable parents, a mother who wants to pimp me out to old white men na mamimigay daw ng allowance at para suportahan ang buong pamilya ko, and at the same time slut shames me when she found out my boyfriend doesn't give me any allowance (he pays for everything and we've only started dating for a few months).

A father who tells me he loves me more than anything in the world and tells me I'm free to do whatever I want but keeps close tabs on me and dogshows me to his friends like I'm a trained puppy na ""Oh, buti pa tong anak ko, simula bata palang, tinuruan ko na to paano maging mabait"" No, I simply chose to abide by your rules otherwise I would've died.

I was raised in Mindanao, my mother worked in Luzon so it was just me and my father. I remember there's this one time, bumaba ako sa school rankings, I went from top 5 to top 10 and I got beaten black and blue for it. I would cry and scream for help and I remember he said, ""Kahit patayin pa kita, walang may pake. Madali lang kitang ilibing sa likod at walang maghahanap sayo."" He was right. No one cared. I tried to tell some people and asked them to call DSWD but they would guilt trip me and say, ""Papa mo pa rin yan. Mama mo yan. Anong gusto mo mangyari sayo? Maging ampon? Pasalamat ka nga may mga magulang ka, yung iba wala.""

I want to heal my childhood trauma and I saw that it starts by forgiving your parents. But I hold so much resentment, I hate them so much. I sometimes wish I'd have killed myself when they were happy with me, and write a suicide note saying I blame them. I'd love to haunt them for the rest of their lives.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1aw89ns/i_want_to_forgive_my_parents_but_its_hard_to_let/,t2_ch5pk0zld,2024-02-21 17:46:49,2
Nauulol ako every time dominant yung bf ko,"My boyfriend is a very soft person. Very golden retriever energy, sunod sa gusto ko most of the time, napakalambing, napakahina ng boses, napakamahinahon, naiiyak over the littlest of things (like pag namimiss nya ako or hindi kami nagkausap for a huge chunk of the day kasi busy kami both) ‚Äî overall, a big baby.

But sometimes, when he's being protective over the people he loves, he becomes dominant. Just like nung time na naging physically and verbally abusive yung LIP ng younger sister nya, tinrashtalk nya yung lalaki tapos hinamon nya pa sa suntukan. He made sure pa na his younger sister was safely removed immediately from the house they were living in. Sobrang touched ko noon kahit hindi naman para saken yung ginawa nya.

Today, nagalit siya kasi binabastos ako ng isang friend ko (let's call him P) but I didn't know how to respond to P kasi he's a VERY close friend of mine and sanay na ako na bastos talaga siya na tao kahit kanino. Parang part ng personality nya maging bastos. Sasabihan lang ako na, ""Joke lang yun"" when I respond with seriousness. In the past week, mas lumala yung kabastusan niya maybe because tinotolerate ko din tsaka dinidismiss ko yung inappropriate jokes nya as being part of his raunchy personality. I already expressed kay bf na ayaw kong ginaganon ako pero di ko alam how to respond properly talaga without harming our friendship. Sabi nya na siya na daw kakausap kay P, pero sabi ko na wag kasi I want to deal with it on my own.

Sinabihan ako ni bf today na, ""Wala kayong pag-uusapan this week or some time soon,"" tapos sinundan nya ng, ""I'm not asking."" If hindi daw titigil, siya na daw talaga kakausap. Sabi nya pa na 'wag daw talaga magpapakita sa kanya ulit si P (they've met several times before) kasi baka mabugbog nya daw. Ewan, naulol ako sa pag-command nya saken. Gusto ko nalang sabihin, ""Yes daddy,"" tapos lumuhod sa harap nya or kumandong sa kanya pero alam kong sobrang inappropriate non for that conversation kasi serious na usapan yon. I know I can do that on my own naman talaga kahit hindi nya sabihin, pero my feeling of not wanting to talk to P anymore was validated nung sinabi nya yon, kaya mas na-empower ako to stop communicating with P.

As someone who's been very dominant and independent all her life, nanibago ako sa feeling na 'to. Kasi all this time I thought I wanted someone na submissive saken, pero nakakabaliw pala when someone's being dominant over me. Ang sarap pala sa feeling na ikaw naman yung inaalagaan, hindi yung ikaw lang nag-aalaga palagi.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/13oo6e3/nauulol_ako_every_time_dominant_yung_bf_ko/,t2_9tsta101,2023-05-22 19:26:33,1392
I hate my boyfriend's fraternity. So. Much.,"I love my boyfriend so much but lately I can't stand his behaviour. His org, his fraternity, takes pride in their application process which involves psychologically hazing and hurling emotional abuse to its applicants. It also interferes with their acads which is already mentally draining to begin with. The whole idea is to break their applicants down psychologically, emotionally, and mentally so that they can see who can withstand pressure and will be worthy of joining their org. There's no physical abuse, but they are made to do physically draining tasks and military-like exercises. I know a lot of orgs do these kind of application processes, but that doesn't make it okay at all and his seems to be longer in duration and stronger in intensity than the average org. It's all so unnecessarily cruel. 

I hated this org when he applied, as I felt like it was putting so much pressure on him when he already had a lot of change to deal with. I hated to think that he was being shouted at, humiliated, forced to do tasks that he would normally be embarrassed to do; plus there was so much to do that it took away a substantial time that could have been used for rest or to study for acads. To the point that he would get physically sick from exhaustion. All in the guise of creating a support system and friends. 

Now that he's no longer an applicant, but a facilitator,  it's all so much worse. How could he be okay with shouting at his juniors? Making them do embarrassing, tiring, menial, and at the same time physically and emotionally draining tasks. To the point that some of the applicants break down or self harm themselves to cope with the pressure. How could he not see the hypocrisy of wanting to be each other's ""family"" but the same time hazing these people? I hate it. I hate knowing that he is capable of bullying, and worse that he can't see that it's bullying. He is justifying all of it; that it is necessary, effective. I hate the self righteousness of it all.

I can't hide my emotions (no poker face at all) so he can always tell that I am not thrilled when he tells me about his org activities. I am trying to be supportive and understanding so as to avoid possible arguments but I just can't yet control my emotions. Yet I can't be open about it as much as I would like,  how much I hate this org, because he LOVES this org. He LOVES this org so much. It is his support system and barkada. How could I possibly take that away from him?? 

So I am left to swallow my comments, my thoughts, and my judgement as often as I can stand, so we won't fight about it. 

Tonight however I feel like I might explode from frustration so let me get this off my chest, PH.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/162u822/i_hate_my_boyfriends_fraternity_so_much/,t2_i1n45wjls,2023-08-28 00:00:56,13

my bf is still seeing his ex gf behind my back,"I'm 19(F). May boyfriend ako, bago pa lang kami ng boyfriend. Mag one month pa lang kami next week. But, a few days ago may nag chat sa akin thru pm. She introduced herself as the friend of my boyfriend's ex. They told me that I should not tell my boyfriend about it. I asked her what's the problem. She told me that my boyfriend used to physically abuse her friend which is my boyfriend's ex. Hindi agad ako naniwala. I ask for proof first. So they created a group chat. Doon inamin sa akin nung ex niya na they still seeing each other. She sent me proofs, such as their pictures together and conversations screenshot. But the screenshots are a bit sketchy since all of it was cropped. When I ask her about the physical abuse, she immediately changed the conversation and told me that she is not ready to share about it. I respected that. She is very pushy with me, gusto niya malaman kung ilang beses kami mag meet up nung boyfriend ko. And when I told her that I don't wanna tell her anything. She got pissed off. Doon na nila ako inaway nung friend niya sa gc na they created. They keep on telling me that I should not believe my boyfriend. They are mad that I don't want to believe them. I confronted my boyfriend about it. He send me proof that the pictures are from last year. And he said sorry and that he loves me. When we had our first date my boyfriend warned me about her ex.

Ang sakit na magwalk out sa isang toxic relationship,"Alam mo ung love mo ung person pero alam mo sa self mo na pag nafall ka ulit sa ‚Äúpromises‚Äù nq magbabago siya, uulit nanaman ung cycle ng emotional and verbal (sometimes physical) abuse. I decided not to accept ung pakikipagbalikan nya kasi sobra na kong nasaktan at napagod sa lahat ng effort ko na di naman nya naappreciate. Parang kahit anong gawin ko, mali, nakakainis, hindi enough. Ang sakit marinig

 Anyways di lang kasi ako makatulog kasi baka part of me nagguilty na kahit nageeffort naman sya recently eh ayaw ko parin. Kaso sa time na tintry nya ayusin nag away nanaman kami (take note di pa kami okay) so ano na????

Sobrang totoo pala ung phrase na ‚Äúsometimes love is not enough‚Äù kasi kahit gano mo kamahal ung tao, mapupuno at mapupuno ka rin talaga. Siguro fault ko na rin kasi binottle ko lang pero everytime nagaaway kami before, lagi ko naman cinocommunicate ung frustrations ko pero it always fell on deaf ears.

Anyways sa mga katulad ko na kakaalis lang sa isang magulong relationship. I hope makahanap na tayong Peace pati narin sa partners natin. Sana magkapeace of mind na tayong lahat.

My Ex bring me to a smalltown in Mindanao and left in destitute.,"Sobrang laki ng pagsisisi ko. Sobrang dependent ako sayo.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I trusted the person and want to build a family pero puro panunumbat, lowkey cheating, at mental/physical abuse ung inabutan ko.

  
I know may pagkukulang rin ako due to my upbringing and trauma. Pero hindi ko talaga inakala na ganito ung mangyayari.

&#x200B;

I accepted ur past kahit may FWB ka before our relationship. Pero nung nag trauma dump lang ako sa ibang babae cheating na kaagad, Ung proof na pinost ko sa FB sa akin pa nag backfire.

Inisip mo nalang sana na nagdala ka tao at pag may-away iiwan mo nlng ng basta2 na parang basura.

Hindi ko lang ma imagine na mas priority mo pa pala ung happiness mo kesa sa well-being ko.

Told a student that it's okay if he does not come to school anymore,"
I'm a teacher. Now, I had a Grade 5 student named ""Nico"" (not his real name) na sobrang disruptive sa klase. Parang little version ng mga siga sa kanto. Mahilig maghamon ng away, mahilig gumawa ng mga kalokohan during class, and mag - ingay.  

So you could imagined how stressful he is during classes for teachers. Madalas ko siyang masaway at mapagsabihan.

Then kanina, while ihahatid ko na yung Grade 5 students ko sa gate ng school to be fetch by their guardian, he was being rowdy again sa classroom pati sa pagpila. 

I am stressed and tired kanina but I know it's not an excuse why I said these words, ""Alam mo, okay lang sa akin kahit hindi ka na pumasok sa school"".

Then Nico replied, ""Ayaw mo na sa akin teacher?""

Maybe it's my imagination but I could hear some sadness in his voice when we he replied to me. 

Then I suddenly realized the meaning behind my words that I said without thinking. And I thought to myself, what the hell am I saying sa isang 11 years old na bata? To think, I even know his history. 

Nico has been the problem of the teachers ever since pumasok siya sa school namin so I already knew him kahit hindi ko pa siya nahahawakan. His father is in prison for being a drug pusher and as a young child, he was exposed to verbal, physical, and mental abuse from his father according to his previous adviser. I've even heard that he was abandoned by his mother.

Kaya I really regret my words but I was not able to retract it or played it as a joke kasi talagang nablangko ako and the next thing I knew nasa gate na kami.

Maybe he'll forget the words I've said to him kanina, maybe it's really my imagination when I heard the sadness in his voice and he doesn't think it's a big deal. Nevertheless, I will assume he is hurt by it and I need to make amends with him on Monday.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/12kp24c/told_a_student_that_its_okay_if_he_does_not_come/,t2_vpj5hn4v,2023-04-13 21:22:59,271
Napakaunfair ng buhay,"I just came across a series of posts on tiktok about this girl who had her PHP30,000 dress custom-made by a celebrity designer for the Eras Tour in Japan. Oo, inggit lang talaga ako. I wasn‚Äôt able to attend my prom in HS and SHS. I didn‚Äôt have a debut either. Handa ko nung 18th bday ko ay sigaw mula sa abusive mother ko at deep-seated fear na anytime bubugbugin na naman ako nito dahil trip niya lang. I‚Äôve never gone out of the country either. My fake peers are all yapping to my face about how they‚Äôre vacationing abroad so I couldn‚Äôt help but get irked. 

Di ko alam bat ganto ang life hahahah tbh ok lang sana kung mahirap lang talaga kami, ok lang sana.

I don't get it!!!!,"I don't get why people seem to EASILY throw their relationships away despite the shallowness of the fight/problem. Gets ko yung mga malalaking problema like cheating or physical abuse, ayun, talagang hindi katanggap tanggap yun.







Pero yung mababaw na away lang na kaya pa naman sana ayusin o pag usapan, sabay itatapon nalang yung relasyon bigla at maghahanap ng bago... yun ang di ko ma-gets. Pagdadaanan at pagdadaanan mo din naman sa ibang babae/lalaki yan. Lahat naman talaga ng relasyon may misunderstandings, eh. Ngayon, nasa sa inyong dalawa nalang ng partner mo kung gusto nyo patagalin o ipaglaban.







Natritrigger ako. My last relationship ended because of shallowness and selfishness. I didn't want to end it but what can I do? Gusto na itapon e. AYUS AYUSIN NYO MAKIPAG RELASYON PARANG AWA NYO NA. 







Para sakin, nakikipag date ka sa isang tao kasi potential syang asawa. Ano yun, pag kasal na kayo, onting away, hiwalay agad? Napaka hihina ng quality ng relationships ngayon. Otherwise, if you don't have a plan to marry that person, then just fuck him/her. Make sure lang na PAREHO kayong nagkakaintindihan sa set up nyo. GIGIGIL AKO!!!!




EDIT: I didn't expect that this post will have a different POVs and versions. When all I'm trying to say is that the relationship nowadays are so easily to end. Seems like everything became so fast paced. Others will break up without even trying to fix it. Everybody's patience became low. Some married people are here as well. Na imbis ayusin problema nila sa mga asawa nila, maghahanap ng landi sa reddit at sa ibang platforms. But who knows, baka nga talagang malala na. Thank you for sharing your POVs. I've learned something new. Also I was not trying to invalidate anything or anyone, never my intention.

Idk how to cope with this,"
I (m19) a good son and a student. Like every parents could ever dream off. But still im not perfect human being. For background . So my aunty (F50) she got no kids just mainly her life revolves around helping our family and being a corporate slave for god knows since when she started being one. As we all expected from her. Shes really strict and got a high superiority complex attitude. To the point where i have to tell my friends i should be at home by 6 or else my whole family especially my brother whos the golden child.  (M23) i dont really care tbh who happens to be a controlling coward and a manipulator would be calling my ass off. He would mentally abuse by gaslighting me for not being a good son and mainly rebellious by staying late and lying. Well he do the same. For the side note. I go to my friend‚Äôs house just to escape from my aunt and mainly the household.He would sometimes physically abuse me for talking back inshort defending myself. Because he always been exaggerating about everything just to make sure he got it all right. I became not really close to all of them. I left my religion and open up to islam. they didnt support me but wanting me to die. I dont really know im so close from ending myself. I felt like i cant find a partner or be in a relationship. If my family would be like this.  They always say that ill be the one taking care of them once they got old and shit. Which i dont really like. I cant live up with this kind of thing. Idk for how long i can endure this because im so close to ending myself.

Mahirap ma abused ng babae sa Pilipinas,"My ex (now colleague) still harasses me kahit na ilang beses na akong nag plead na layuan na nya at tigilan na nya ko. Ilang beses akong nagmamakaawa pero hindi nya marespeto yun. Lagi nya kong hinarass sa chat/text at in person. We broke up for almost 6 months and she still thinks na kami pa rin until now. Guarding me with my every move. 

She's confronting or harassing me because:

1. Nagmamakaawa siya na maging kami ulit
2. She keeps saying na ako yung sinungaling at manipulative. 
3. Manunumbat siya sa lahat ng nagawa nya for me
4. Tinatakot nya ko na mag suicide siya pag di ko siya kinausap. 

I've been enduring that cycle repeatedly week for 6 months. Masakit lang sa part ko na she's making things up para mag mukhang victim and the fact na nagmakaawa na ko sa kanya na to stop confronting me everytime may relapse sya. Tbh, sobrang draining sa mental health and I can't seek for help Kasi I'm a guy and ang hirap i prove na I am verbally, physically and psychologically abused.

How I ruined my Ex's life for Getting with my Best friend,"**\[LONG POST AHEAD\]**

&#x200B;

First of all, I already know maraming magagalit saakin, perhaps because masyadong harsh ang ginawa ko. TW lang sa mga mambabasa, this post will contain sexual harassment, physical abuse, and religious CULTS.

SO, my first ex boyfriend and I began dating noon high school pa, precisely 8th grade. We dated for almost 4 years until niloko niya ako sa best friend ko. I'll call her ""A"". Noong una, sobrang perfect ng relationship. He was my first boyfriend and akala ko my last. I would say very low maintenance ako that time, tipong kahit hindi niya ako binibigyan ng bulaklak during Anniversary namin or Valentines, presence niya was enough for me. Naintindihan ko rin ang situation niya since noong una palang sinabi na niya saakin ""mahirap lang kami"". This is because Typhoon Yolanda severely affected his family (he grew up in Tacloban ) financially and naghirap sila. Prior to the typhoon his family wasn't financially stable na rin. So mas lumala lang ang situation nila, tapos madami pa sila magkakapatid. This explains why kinailangan niya lumuwas sa Maynila at mag aral. Matalino ang ex ko, like no joke. I studied in a well known private school in Manila, perhaps the whole Philippines pa. So to be a scholar there was a big deal. He excelled in everything, ma-pa sports or academics, which explains why na in love ako sakanya. I didn't give a single F kung mahirap siya, I fell in love with his intelligence, passion and ambition for success.

Fast forward to my 12th year of HS (4 years later),  biglang nagiba ang ugali niya when he entered college (he was a year above my grade level so nauna siya mag kolehiyo.). I was so confused and frustrated kasi 3 years consistent ang princess treatment niya saakin. He got physically abusive to the extent na wala na sa lugar. Pinapahiya niya ako in public, tipong sisigawan ako sa harap ng maraming tao. The first time he abused me was when sinampal niya ako. And not like yung mahina na sampal, but yung tipong FULL FORCE na sampal. Imagine, I am a 5'2 female and he's a 5'8 male na slightly malaman ang physique -- not to mention main sport pa niya in HS was volleyball. Sa sobrang lakas ng sampal niya I fell to the ground and nagka pasa ako sa face for one week. For most girls, the first thing they would do is makipaghiwalay, diba? Kaso, t4nga ako that time. He apologized and comforted me after this incident and nagsinungaling ako sa parents ko na natamaan ako ng bola sa mukha during intrams. I let it go because he apologized profusely and nangako na it would never happen again. But of course, it DID happen again. Multiple times in fact. I was 18 years old at the time pa.

Months later, I received a long message from him, stating na gusto na niya mag ""repent"" sa mga ""sins"" niya saakin. Nakipag break siya saakin. He joined a church, which I later found out was a cult pala. Sa cult na ito may ""quota"" sila, like how many people they could recruit to their church. They would get praised pag na reach nila ito. Dinamay pa niya ako sa kulto niya aaaah! And as expected, it was a living hell. In this Church you were monitored most of the time, dating was prohibited without the approval of the pastors and you had to take an oath na kailangan mo ibigay ang life mo sa church (ang reasoning nila is because Jesus did the same for God). Despite being in the church though, patago kami gumagawa ng indecent acts. The slightest physical intimacy was ABSOLUTELY prohibited but ginagawa pa rin namin sa likod ng mga sisters/brothers/pastors. Not gonna lie, at some point I was genuinely committed to serving the Lord, but it was so difficult for me to stay ""holy"" when my ex would pressure me to do indecent acts with him. Sobrang hypocritical niya, yung ip-pressure niya ako makipag talik pero the next day he would be preaching about staying holy until marriage. Like what the F! And yes, technically break na nga kami but I thought wala lang yon because he still treated me like his girlfriend.

Bob0 kasi ako, akala ko kami pa. Kaso, he started showing interest kay ""A"" and completely disregarded me. He began pursuing ""A"". *For context*, ""A"" was my best friend sa church. She was sweet, intelligent and kind. My ex met ""A"" through me and naging bff din sila because they go to the same University apparently. When my ex began pursuing her yung money na hinihiram niya saakin (but hindi naman binabayaran) ginagastos niya kay ""A"" for flowers and gifts. The audacity. Although, habang nililigawan pa niya si ""A"" saakin pa rin siya pumupunta, perhaps because of the uncertainty. As a T4nga, hinayaan ko lang. I thought if I treated him better pipiliin niya ako. Umabot pa sa punto na  nagmakaawa ako na ako nalang. *Wa epek*. When pinayagan na siya ng pastors to pursue ""A"" he ghosted me completely and avoided me in Church. Sa harap ko pa siya nag ""Will you be my Girlfriend?"" kay ""A"" at a special Church event. P0ta!  After niya ako paasahin, gawing sugar mommy and Fbuddy????

**Ito na ang exciting part**, I had so many mix emotions like heartbreak, frustration and anger. Mostly anger. Because I felt used and manipulated. So, sinabi ko kay ""A"" everything, that we were doing indecent acts, na ginamit niya ako, na kami pa when we entered the church and LEFT the Church. When I left the Church I gave myself some time off and decided to forget everything nalang. UNTIL narinig ko na my ex completely twisted the story and pinagkalat sa Church na I was the one pressuring him (huh?). Sa sobrang nandilim ang paningin ko I decided plotting a plan how I could completely ruin his life. Since pilit nag mamabait other sisters/brothers ko sa Church I would frequently message them, acting all buddy buddy, pretending na I am completely oblivious sa mga pinagsasabi nila behind my back. Praise the Gods my OG akong friend sa church (who eventually left din) na chinismis saakin na my ex sexually harassed ""A"". Hinalikan siya ng walang consent ni ""A"" and also pressured her frequently to do indecent acts. Their relationship went downhill from their because nag sumbong si ""A"" sa pastors. HA! I put this information to good use and pinagkalat sa University niya of what he did to ME and ""A"" (without uncovering our names). I anonymously posted sa Freedom Wall ng University niya and name dropped him. Like, name, batch and course pa. I exposed how he was an abuser, predator and manipulator. Inexpose ko rin ang darkest secret niya, na nanonood siya ng child hentai (which is technically child p, diba?). Nahuli ko sa gallery niya na he had hentai vids and pics of sexualized versions of child anime characters (like yung mga white blood cells sa Cells at Work anime). Alam ko, na b0b0 ako for letting this slide, but he reasoned na they were just drawings. Huh? Anyways, when the post gained enough attention I deleted it to cover my tracks. A week later, my ex's friend (who eventually became my friend na rin) informed me na my ex was being completely alienated in campus hehe. Receiving dirty looks, anonymous threats, and getting bullied almost. A month later nagpost siya sa FB na he felt unsafe sa campus and had to drop out and needed financial support from his ""brothers and sisters"" in Church. I know ang sama, but sobrang saya ko when I read that post. The thought na I had ruined his reputation sa University niya, relationship and Church ... sensational.

Also, if you're thinking about his family, I also took care of it. I told them everything via messenger na ginawa niya saakin and they were on my side. Sabi saakin ng sis ng ex ko (close ko rin) binugbog ang  ex ko ng father niya when he came home for Christmas sa Tacloban for being ""kahihiyan"" and for ruining his future. THANKS TITO ILY!

&#x200B;

PS. Also, I know dapat I should have been the matured one and walked away nalang para walang gulo. Sabi nga nila, God forgives even the greatest sinners. Unfortunately, for my ex, hindi ako Diyos.

I HATE MYSELF,"F(16) I am feeling SO SO GUILTY right now. I impulsively 'pitik' (without any second thoughts, as if my hand acted on its own due to my emotions) my mother slightly at the back of her head after I was offended by what she said. She said, 'nananakit ka na ah' and kinda punched me on my shoulder. Her words HURT me, knowing that my father physically abused her before. I just want to KMS I FEEL SO GUILTY

But she also hurts us when she gets angry. I hate how I am becoming like them. I'm literally trying hard to control myself when I'm feeling overwelming emotions because I usually hurt myself but this time I JUST CANT.... : (

My mom‚Äôs friend raped me,"

I was raped when I was 18 by my mom's friend, and when I was 20, I told my mom about it. My mom has been my trauma since I was a kid; she has physically and verbally abused me since I was a child because I think she  despise my father so much. So back to the topic I told her na I was raped nung 20 na ako pero ewan ko di nya ata ako pinaniwalaan and now I‚Äôm 23 and I accidentally open her account kase nagbakasyon sya dito sa condo namen ng husband ko and unang una kong nakita na magka chat pa din sila nung lalake na nang rape saken, all this time pala di nya ko talaga pinaniwalaan and super sakt for me kase pinatawad ko na sya ng buong buo sa lahat ng pambubugbog nya saken dati and I even support her financially until today kase may sakt sya pero kaht naman nung wala pa syang saket lahat lahat ng kinikita ko sa modeling and work ko napupunta sa kanila nagtitiis ako dito sa manila just for them ng mga kapated ko sa province, She never treated me as her daughter pala talaga lalo na siguro kung wala akont nabbigay na pera sa kanya . Sobrang saket talaga lalo na nasa kanya trauma ko , dahil lang talaga sa kapated ko kaya di ko sya kina cut off sa buhay ko naawa ako sa baby brother ko which is 9 yrs old pa lang kc nakikita ko din minsan na verbally abuse sya, gusto ko na ngang kuhain un pero di naman ako mananalo sa batas kase sya pa din nanay and half sister lang ako.

I hate how co-GenZs friends reacted and looked down on my dream about being a good mother/housewife,"Idk if this is a right sub pero nakakainis hahahaha. 

I really don‚Äôt get the amount of hate I got from my friends when I told them na I want to be a housewife, be a good mother figure and create a cozy family pag napag-uusapan yung ganap sa sarili or plans in future sa catch up. Napatungan pa ulit when my friend screenshot yung repost ko sa tiktok which is vid about family, dating, marriage na nakacollage ganon. Ako naman medyo matagal ako mag check ng gc and grabe na flood na nung nakita ko. I know it‚Äôs supposed to be a joke to jump with but I was hurt. They be like, ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt relate‚Äù, ‚ÄúHirap magka-anak teh‚Äù, ‚ÄúYung pinaiyak ka sa nursing tas magiging nanay ka lang‚Äù, ‚ÄúSi **** puro repost ng ganyan.‚Äù 

Medyo na-off lang ako kasi I thought I‚Äôm already in supportive friend group since I cut off my old friend group last year. Ano bang meron? Ano bang masama sa pagiging housewife? Funny how most of them are self-proclaimed feminist but doesn‚Äôt tend to support their co-female dream, I mean I‚Äôm not being forced naman eh, I don‚Äôt get the hate ba‚Äôt pinagtatawanan eh choice ko yun. I want it. I WANT IT SO BAD.

I grew up in chaotic family, I don‚Äôt have a father figure, I was raised by my alcoholic and physically abuser mother (she died early) then passed on to my grandparents. I always envy people who have a complete family simula bata ako. May pangarap rin naman ako to be a nurse, I‚Äôm doing great sa academics but having a complete and happy family talaga pinakadream ko. Minsan natatakot ako kasi baka matulad ako sa mother ko, iniiyakan ko yun pag nag o-overthink ako sa future pero I know to myself na I will try my best to treat them like how ng grandparents treated me. I want to have children na mababatayan ko so they wouldn‚Äôt feel lonely. I want a loving husband. I want to be a supportive and loving mother/partner. 

Hayyy. It‚Äôs just so hard to expressed feelings like this nowadays kasi napupuno ng back flash. Please mind your own dream. If you think yours is superior, good for you but walang madaling pangarap. If you don‚Äôt wanna get married, have children, that‚Äôs fine but please don‚Äôt judge people who want to create one.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1ak4c8s/i_hate_how_cogenzs_friends_reacted_and_looked/,t2_t2o6wc46i,2024-02-06 15:33:46,76
I already feel numb at this point,"TW: Physical abuse, emotional and verbal abuse

Hi Reddit.

I‚Äôve been contemplating writing here, but I have a lot of thoughts right now and I just want to unload.
Kakauwi ko lang mula barangay. I tried to find out the best legal ways I can to file a case against my biggest abuser - my brother.

I started the fight tonight. Nagparinig ako na medyo malakas kasi for the nth time in a row, kinuhaan na naman ako ng gamit. I‚Äôve had enough. We live in a compound, nakatira sya sa ibang unit, ako nakatira sa mismong bahay namin. After nya ako marinig, he came barging in with the item he stole and shouting ‚ÄúMay problema ka ba?! May problema ka ba?!‚Äù then he grabbed me by my neck and threw me outside. I didn‚Äôt want to fight, I know that if he inflicted more damage to me, he‚Äôd be more in trouble, and alas, as I was trying to go inside the house again, he was stopping me. At one point he punched me multiple times that I lost count. I‚Äôm already numb with the pain. I have been hit by a baseball bat when I was 16 and a monobloc chair when I was 17. I‚Äôm now 30, but things haven‚Äôt changed.

While the commotion happened, my mom just watched. She didn‚Äôt stop my brother or anything, she just watched at the side. She just watched me being punched and kicked. I grew up in the same way. She wasn‚Äôt really the best parent, as she coddled my brother saying ‚Äúaway kapatid‚Äù lang yun, but I still love her. Even when she blamed me for being diagnosed with cancer when I was 14, I still love her. She said na magastos, at naiinis sya dun - I get her though, she‚Äôs the only one working in the household. My dad was an alcoholic, a gambler as well. My brother followed his footsteps. Thankfully, my lola helped me with therapy. Pero you know, what set apart my dad from my mom before he died? He actually defended me. He saw me getting hit by the monobloc chair from earlier and he defended me. Sadly, even if he was battling cancer that time, my brother picked up the broken pieces of the chair and hit my dad the same way he hit me, and things were peaceful for a time dahil pinalayas sya ng dad ko, kaya lang my dad died eventually and my brother used that ‚Äúopportunity‚Äù to come back home.

We weren‚Äôt really on good terms ever since. He physically hurt me multiple times since I was 6. Verbally abused me as well. But what I can‚Äôt really fathom is the fact na nung pandemic, nung 2020, winithdraw nya yung buong retirement fund ni mama - nearly half a million pesos - and it was all gone. My mom didn‚Äôt know that my brother was getting all her hard earned money for months, pero eventually pinatawad nya, kasi nagdala ng pancit nung umuwi after nya makuha yung pera. Ako? I cared for my mom when the pandemic hit, even if nawalan ako ng income that time. I tried my best, but what did I get in return? I heard my mom say to me ‚ÄúSana hindi ka na pinanganak, sana hindi ka na naging parte ng pamilyang ito!‚Äù when all I did was serve her canned sardines because that is all that I can afford.

I am numb at this point.
I have to get a medical examination later for my scars at sa mga onting bukol sa mukha ko.
My best friend heard the commotion, and recorded the audio all while it was happening. We have evidence.
But personally, weirdly, I‚Äôm stoic right now.

Para bang oo, binugbog ulit ako, pero it‚Äôs like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm disappointed but not surprised.‚Äù The only insult he can throw to me is ‚ÄúAno lalaban ka? Bakla ka kasi!‚Äù

At the end of the day, I try to be the best human I can be. I volunteer for a non-government organization helping out people in need. I know that I am loved by my peers and that is enough for me. I have a job now that gets to sustain me. I have achievements under my belt that I never knew I could accomplish. Irregardless of my sexuality, I am living my life trying to help those who need it most, and the people who stand by my side, and I am happy with that.

He may hurt me outside, but he cannot reach the light I have inside.
As much as he hurt me, he helped shape who I am today.

A fighter.
A survivor.

And at the end of the day, I‚Äôm okay with that.
Ika nga, the best revenge is living your best life when your abuser is living (or gonna live) the life he deserves.

I‚Äôll be okay.
I‚Äôll do things the right way. I will fight the right way. Not through fists and force.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/191ssmp/i_already_feel_numb_at_this_point/,t2_jgbvr4tl,2024-01-09 02:58:08,44
Pagod na akong umintindi sa friend kong religious na nasa toxic relationship,"My friend, in her 40's, has married a guy 20years her junior. 

Before they are married, they were happy nong una. Guy was sweet and I think what got her heart is the guy is really proud of her and their relationship despite their huge age gap.

Years down the line lumabas ang tunay na kulay ng guy. He's a cheater and a liar. He can't stop contacting his exes. Heck, tinago niya na may anak pala siya sa ex niya. Also, ginawa niyang sugar mommy ang friend ko. Pag hindi napagbigyan ang luho or di nabigyan ng pera, he will be verbally abusive towards my friend. 

Pero si friend, oh my god. She will try and justify all his actions with bible verses kahit nasasaktan na siya. Kesyo 'asawa' na daw niya di daw niya kayang hiwalayan. Ipapasa-diyos na lang niya at magdadasal siya araw araw para magbago siya.

Then nagpropose si guy. I completely oppose to this. Again, di nakinig si friend kasi hopeful siya na through marriage, magbago na si guy dahil their relationship is 'blessed' by God na.

Unsurprisingly, hindi nagbago si guy. In fact, he got *worst*. Mas lalo siya naging verbally abusive cos my friend does not have financial means anymore to sustain the lifestyle he wants. It has now escalated to physical violence. 

My heart is breaking for my friend cos she's such a sweet, beautiful person and she does not deserve this. Kaya din siya nagstay with the guy cos he grew up in a broken family and my friend just wants him to feel the love he never felt from his family.

My friend left his abuse for a few months. I fully supported her and binibigyan ko ng advise and make her realise her worth. Akala ko natauhan na siya but boy I was wrong. 

Bumalik si guy and he 'changed'. My friend thought na 'answered prayers' yung pagbabago niya. Nagbunga ang araw araw na pagdadasal niya. Sweet na sila ulit and mukhang masaya na sila ulit. 

This morning she is messaging me again on how guy is going back to verbally abusing her and it has escalated again. She asked for some money na pamasahe to leave him. I am happy to do so pero how long will this cycle go?

Sa totoo lang pagod na pagod na ako sa linyahan niya na ipapasa-diyos nalang niya lahat na magdadasal siya lagi para magkaayos sila. 

I hope she will leave him for good.

"It is my late Pa's birthday, and I'm still resentful","My father died in 2014 due to diabetes complications (which is his own doing since he refused to take insulin even though the docs already advised him years before to consider). He was a chronic cheater - he got my mom pregnant and they're not married then. He cheated on her, and got the other woman pregnant too. The gap between me and my half-sibling were mere months. He had another child with the said woman and then he got my mom pregnant again (mom really has issues to deal with her own too, apparently). He had two more children after my sister with the other woman, AND CHEATED ON HER AGAIN, WITH ANOTHER WOMAN. That another woman also got pregnant, and he got twins - who were just turning two or three when Pa died.

Pa is an asshole, and he never been a good father to us. On my 7th birthday, my mom invited him to eat with us in a local Jollibee store. He showed up, but said he was in a hurry and merely THREW a fucking 500 peso bill on our table where we waited for him. He left without greeting me a happy birthday, my mom cried as we ate.

I cannot wish you a happy birthday Pa, sincerely - fuck you. Fuck you for all the trauma you gave me and my sister. Fuck you kasi kahit sa mga half-siblings ko tinraumatize mo sa iyong constant cheating, emotional and physical abuse. Fuck you at lahat ng mga kamag-anak mo na in-others kami. Taenamo, ngayon lang kita mamumura, ang sama pa rin ng loob ko kahit na sinasabi ko na pinatawad na kita kasi patay ka na. Kaawaan ka nawa ng Diyos pero bahala ka na diyan. Hindi mo deserve magkaroon ng magandang memoriam sa birthday mo dahil tarantado ka.

We are so fed up of our dad,"He never fails to ruin Christmas and New Year eversince we were a child. Even the simplest celebration, he always makes a way to ruin the joy of it by drinking too much then verbally and physically abusing my mom. This already gave us a deep trauma. He doesn‚Äôt even care. Even his grandchildren are already having a trauma.

He still doesn‚Äôt realize why the hell we didn‚Äôt want to celebrate any occasion at home anymore. We are so fed up. Me and my siblings told mom to leave him alone this coming new year. Or just leave him there alone forever. We are willing to find a separate place for mom and the kids (my OFW sibling‚Äôs kids).

He is a narcissist. He blames everyone about any bad thing except himself. He will always choose other people over his family. He will side with the people who did bad things to his family. He is an extreme people pleaser. He is hypocrate. He is very pretentious. He is toxic. There is no peace everytime he is around.

We already did what we can to adjust for him. Tried to talk to him when he is not drunk, but too egoistic to talk about the issue. When he‚Äôs drunk he will open it up but you will never ever understand him (because he‚Äôs f*cking drunk).

We are so fed up. He is a hopeless case.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/18ska22/we_are_so_fed_up_of_our_dad/,t2_40hyu5etu,2023-12-28 11:50:45,3

I'm still healing,"I didn't realize how bad it was until it was over. You don't think it will ever happen to you until it does. He was verbally abusive, would scream at the top of his lungs, gas lite the fuck outta me, and tried to become physically abusive. 

I left the day he threw me from the door to the couch after I broke up with him asking for another chance I only made it out because I had it ready to call the police and showed him I would call if he didn't move from by the door and let me leave.

He followed me to the car stood in front of it and hit it once before I hit call and put it on speaker he ran back to his place. I left so the police never came. 

This guy was going into the military so I told him while he was in basic. I was going to move to Utah for college and go to school. He ended up getting into an accident and getting a dui so he could not go anymore. He expected me to cancel my plans and stay and when I told him no, he accused me of leaving the state so I could leave him.

Now almost a decade later happily married with a baby and I realized how much he messed me up.
I would constantly check in with my husband to make sure I wasn't doing anything wrong as soon as I felt like I disappointed him I would cower waiting for the yelling and name calling slut shaming.

My ex apologized to me years later and was mad that his apology didn't garner the response he expected. I have you blocked how are you even contacting me sir!!!!

I still find myself sometimes falling back into those behaviors and then I'm reminded that's no longer me so I don't need to wear those wounds anymore

Female abuser,"There this psychopathic ex of mine na sinasaktan ako physically and verbally dahil lang sa mga tamang hinala or pagiging selosa nya. Mind you, ex status na kami at siya rin tong currently that time ay active sa bumble at ako hindi. 

Nagseselos siya dahil lang may nakakausap or I was just being a nice colleague sa mga kasama namin. Nasa med field kami so majority babae. May time na nakatabi ko lang yung isang babae kong colleague sa lounge while I'm watching a series tapos bigla siyang mag cchat na ang intimate ko daw with her. I dont even fucking know my colleague's name that time. 

Tapos pag i coconfront nya ko she always verbally accused me of something na hindi ko naman ginawa and pag nag init ulo nya due to her overthinking sasaktan nya ko. 

May time na pinagsasampal nya ko then nung natalsik salamin ko (I wear a glass) bigla na kong napikon so I pushed her away to stop hurting me its just that nag land yung both knees nya non kaya nagka pasa and she took a photo of that as evidence at pinapakita nya sa lahat para ako yung mukhang abuser and mas madali maka convince na abuser ang lalake kesa babae. 

May time rin na she's confronting me while I'm driving and she punched me sa likod ng ulo ko 4 to 5 times. During those time sobrang nag iinit na ko pero I controlled myself dahil I'm driving. Pero nung time na yon my hands felt numb and ang blurry ng vision ko. 

Her abuse's been going on for almost 6 months now. May mga kaibigan na ring nadamay sa problema namin at syempre kakampihan nila or mag side pa rin sila sa babae while they label or spread lies about me making me as the toxic abuser guy. 

All I want for the both of us is peace. How many times I tried to make amenments pero siya tong insisting na gusto nya exclusive kami, gusto nya sa kanya lang ako pag kami ang nag uusap. 

I always received  hate messages from her. Blaming me ;  Saying na ako yung sinungaling at ako yung manipulative. It hurts a lot dahil siya yung nagmamanipulate sakin dati pa by threatening me na mag suicide siya pag di ko siya kinakausap o pag di ako pumayag na maging kami ulit. She always fooling me around rin na nag iimbento siya ng mga bagay just to control me.


It's hard to be abused in this world lalo na pag babae abuser mo. Pag lalake ka, need mo pang i justify, i prove, mag collect ng decent evidence just to be heard of. Pero di pa rin guaranteed yung help, sympathy at justice dahil ""lalake"" ka at nasa Pilipinas ka. And in the end of the day you're just a low life sad boy asking for pity.

I'm so sick of my dad who emotionally tortures me,"Idk why, but for some reason my dad is angry at me all the time. Hindi siya yung galit na may verbal or physical abuse. Yung galit niya involves his general interaction towards me. I can sense his anger just by his facial expressions also. Mahilig din siya magdabog when I'm around. He also barely talks to me. Kakausapin niya lang ako if may kailangan siyang sabihin or itanong na importante. Actually, he avoids me as much as he can. Like for example, hindi siya papasok sa kitchen if nasa loob ako, talagang hihintayin niya akong lumabas bago siya pumasok. He's also emotionally unavailable, so I was never close to him growing up. 

Matagal na siyang ganito sa akin, bata pa lang ako ganyan na siya, I'm already 22 btw. For a while I was so angry with him, lalo na nung high school period ko. But actually natanggap ko na na ganyan na siya forever, so I made peace with his actions na, or so I thought.  Recently kasi, I felt that pain and hurt again when he would do those things to me. I'm so sick of it. 

I wish he wasn't my father. Actually nasabihan ko na siya when I was a kid na sana hindi nalang siya yung dad ko. I honestly forgot why I said that, and I honestly don't even remember saying that to him. Sinabi lang sakin ng mom ko yun, and I still mean it to this day. But I won't let him make me suffer forever. I will remove his power to hurt me, and one day it won't hurt anymore.

Stop procreating!!!,"I've been hating my life for the longest and suicidal. 

Here's why, 
Mom and dad is not emotionally matured enough to raise a loving family. 
My dad ended up cheating leaving my mom in misery, Became an OFW to support us. 
Our oldest brother end up being a criminal, My Oldest sister became the head of the family since dad no longer with us and mom is abroad. (She was just in 3rd year college btw) 
My other brother who is 5years older than me plays the victim role and the bully alternately. 
I am the punching bag. 

- I grew up having a conflicted personality coz I always need to be conscious with the way I behave, They are easily irritated and gets angry. My childhood years was like walking on eggshells, constant fear and anxiety. 

- I thought that my emotion never matter since I am always invalidated growing up. 

- We were poor and my sister needs to sacrifice her studies for us. 

- My sister lived in with her partner, I end up living with my brother which was hell. I always cry at night, He screams at me all the time and verbally abused me, Physical abuse was also present. I thought all families are like this. 

- Present- I am now 29, living faw away,  No plans to get married or have kids,  Why? I still have all the traumas in me. I still hear voices in my head. I have issues socializing, I still cry, I dunno bounderies, I am so hard on myself everytime I fail on something. I even caught myself repeating the behavior of my brother to my colleagues. I feel so mentally fucked up in life. 

I am writing this to whoever may read this to please THINK a million times before you procreate. 
Ask yourself if you can give your child a complete loving and supportive family, Financial support and emotional support. 

You might not see the bigger effects of this neglects yet, but try to dig deep why there are psychopaths, sociopaths or increased with  depression cases,  uproductive prople of the society etc. 

I am speaking from a perspective of a neglected child who constantly fights depression, traumas and urge of wanting to k*ll someone/myself. I never wanted to be born anyways. What choice do I have coming to this world.

I want to break up with my partner of 7 years,"We‚Äôve been through college together and are almost done with grad school. Been through almost every struggle together, in school or personal.  I preface this by saying my partner comes from an abusive household. Some verbal abuse (and sometimes physical, usually throwing things) has happened at their home, and I‚Äôve even been an audience to some at times. My partner has also been verbally abusive to me during fights during the past years, which he has honestly been improving  and changing significantly on.

&#x200B;

A few months prior, we had a huge fight that resulted in me calling it quits. Things got quite ugly. It started as screaming in my face, begging, crying. Then when I rejected all of it, things got physical ‚Äî not at me though. They started harming themselves in front of me which didn‚Äôt amount to much (just a few scratches, thank god). I've put the trigger warning so I won't go into detail, but it involves a certain kitchen tool and household cleaning product.

&#x200B;

I‚Äôve honestly been fucked up ever since. I didn‚Äôt confide in family until last week (I‚Äôve lived apart from them since 2015), and only one of my friends knows about all that happened but they live very far away. I can‚Äôt hear a knock on my door without fearing they will burst through or start screaming at me. This is the first time they‚Äôve ever done anything remotely physical, but I‚Äôm scared it wont be the last. I‚Äôve since moved to a new location  and never told them about it (they don‚Äôt know where I live now, but it‚Äôs still really close to where I was prior so they could easily find out if they asked around). I want to break up with them, I just don‚Äôt know how to do it without potentially being  physically hurt.

&#x200B;

Thing is, they appear to be a model partner in public spaces. Everyone knows them as the funny and smart guy. They always post us when we go out to have dinner, and looking from the outside they really look like the model partner. They have connections that can get me to a great career path too. But I want to break it off now, regardless. None of my graduate school friends know about the incident, because news spreads quickly and I don‚Äôt want to ruin his future. But it‚Äôs really jarring to think how crazy he can get behind closed doors like that.

I want to run away but I'm scared.,"TW: physical, and emotional abuse mention

(Sorry for the wrong Filipino terms English is my first language even if I'm half-Filo)

Hi, 18 na ako since last year pa - turning 19 this year. Trans male ako, I knew since I was a teen pa. I live in a upperclassmen home, no rent just bills but I want to run away and go somewhere far far from my family.

 I have been abused since I was a kid, my dad had a bad temper cause of his own dad. He would hit us when we did something wrong, or yell at us if we didn't do it quick enough or right in his eyes. He has lessened the physical violence since we're older now, but won't hesitate to shout and cuss us out if we don't meet his standards.

I live with my mom, brother (24M), sister (19F), and dad's side in the house. Hindi ako pwede umalis without permission, kasi girl ako. My sister is treated much worse, as a black sheep for some reason hindi ko alam why. She is a good student, very loud but very bubbly to everyone, really nice. Yet my mom doesn't like her, says she's being influenced by her friends? but I know her friends, they're fine - just loud lang.

Just recently lang, my sister got too loud and was yelled at - told off for being a disturbance, kasi she got too heated in a game. My mom pulled her aside, and I won't go into detail, but she is in danger of getting kicked out.

I don't want her to leave, I don't know what I'd do without her kasi, but she's at risk of getting hurt before kicked out daw. I want her to be safe, but I don't want her to stay here too. Our home is very unstable but it's a good home outside of the family issues.

I only have debit and gcash but it's not enough if she leaves, I want to go with her if that happens, I don't want her to be alone. I want to get a job but not even allowed part time bc of college. Everything I own belongs to my family, aside from a few things that aren't important.

I want to keep her safe bc she raised me, but I don't want to get hurt and kicked out too. I want to support her in every way possible.  I'm not skilled in anything but drawing.

Grieving because I miss my grandma during her pre-dementia years,"
My grandmother looked after me from my early years until my teenage phase. This was due to my mother being overseas to avoid her parental duties, while my father had another family because my mom was his mistress.

My grandmother's approach to parenting was authoritative, which caused me to hate her while growing up. She used emotional and physical abuse as a means of discipline. In my opinion, these are disciplinary methods of the silent generation.

During my teenage years, I often returned home late just to avoid her presence. I avoid  discussing my school experiences with her and would immediately go inside my room.

 I regret my decision of hating her during my teenage years. My perspective shifted drastically when the person who had cared for me ended up in the hospital.

Despite her strictness, she taught me values and beliefs that have shaped my character, something only a family member can do. I now recognize that I was not alone in life.

Regrettably, after multiple hospitalizations, her health deteriorated, and our family doctor diagnosed her with dementia. 

While she's still alive, her communication skills lack the receptiveness and expressiveness they had before her dementia.

Taking pictures together now requires me to prompt her to smile, which is heartbreaking. Her ability to carry out daily activities independently has diminished due to dementia, intensifying the grief I feel...

I deeply regret underestimating her significance in my life yet I'm now committed to providing her with the love and care she deserves in her remaining years. 

However, I doubt I can fully repay her kindness of molding me to become the person I am today.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/15yybmj/grieving_because_i_miss_my_grandma_during_her/,t2_7x9u2t51,2023-08-23 17:06:55,3
A relative committed suicide,"I'll start this off by saying that me and that relative were not really close as of recently, but when we were younger, we were neighbors and would often play outside.

A younger relative, who was 15 last year, took his own life. His immediate family is saying that he did it because his gf broke up with him, though honestly, most of us think that it's a cover-up since he had shitty parents. I can't really say much since we're not that close anymore. The person who was first to discover him hanging was his younger sister; they were able to rush him to the hospital, but he was declared brain dead, and after three days, he was gone. 

The younger sister is traumatized by that sight and we would often see her posts on socmed that she wants to off her self too. Some of my cousins who see the said posts are badmouthing her, saying that the younger generation is so sensitive and goes on romanticizing the physical abuse they had growing up.

Crying has always been a painful thing for me. When I cry, there's a genuine pain deep in my stomach and it makes me cry out both from the sheer mental pain and from the physical pain. It's like the deep hurt I have bottled up takes physical form.

But today, I didn't cry because I was in pain... There was no pain... **Just happiness!** My boyfriend made me cry happy tears for the first time in my life.

Kakatapos lang namin mag-dinner at pinagluto ko siya kahit I sucked at it. I tried, I really did.  I was already working when this happened. Busy ako sa pagpapakaalipin ng salapi.

He spoke in a neutral tone and said, *""Love, alam mo ba?""*

*""Hindi pa""*, I replied.

*""You're the best partner.""*

*""Thank you.""*

Patlang.

*""I want to have a future with you.""*

I didn't know how to respond. I looked at him and gave him a sly smile. Sabi ko what's up? Was it the tuna sandwich I made earlier? Tapos bumalik lang ako sa pagtatrabaho. I looked at him again. Nakatitig lang siya sa akin. Sabi ko what's up ulit? Wala raw. I continued working tapos paglingon ko, he's still staring. Nilapitan ko na siya and I hugged him. I jokingly said na taga-probinsiya ako pero hindi ako marunong manggayuma. We laughed tapos naging seryoso siya ulit. He started saying such kind things like:*""You're beautiful, you're smart, you're kind and caring. You're compassionate. Sobrang alaga mo. I couldn't ask for more. I appreciate you. I want to have a future with you.""* I hugged him and I wept softy.

I've never been told anything like this before...  Zero, nada! My whole life, I've been used to abuse and hurt. Ni kahit thank you sa mga tao, wala. To hear such simple yet kind sentences as these... shook me to my core. Words like that were so alien to me. I cried on his chest for a good hour. He just held me. I think a part of me healed tonight. This guy made me believe again in a concept often dismissed as hackneyed -- LOVE.

Deal breaker sa akin ang kasal at pagaanak but there's nobody else I'd rather spend the rest of my life with... I want to have a future with my boyfriend too...",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/171k0a3/my_boyfriend_made_me_cry/,t2_qgtnxp4f,2023-10-07 02:32:54,101
emotional roulette,"the usual. wala namang bago, but i can feel it taking a toll on me na talaga both mentally and physically. walking on eggshells sa araw-araw, sasabayan mo pa ng pakiramdaman sa mga tao sa paligid mo na para bang roleta ang emosyon. do i get the calm attitude? do i get the aggressive one? (always the later haha) sobrang nakakapagod manghula, mag-abang, at maging cautious all the time. do i only get verbal abuse, or do i get the side of physical threats this time as well? buti na nga lang its been months since the last physical thing that i've experienced and all that i have to worry about at this moment are the verbal things.

hindi na natalab sakin 'yung hayaan na lang pumasok sa isang tenga, labas sa kabila. namumuro na ko to the extent na lagi na kong na-ttritrigger and be on the verge of relapse every time i hear someone raise their voice, or just even talk. sobrang rattled ko na lately, my neck and head hurts, and hindi na napapawi yung antok sa katawan ko.

Here in the US b·ª©t terribly depressed.,"As the title says I‚Äôm here moved here in the US not too long ago, leaving all my friends and adoptive family behind to look for a job so that I can sustain myself and my future family. I know I cannot complain, I‚Äôd be ungrateful if I did, but right now there‚Äôs just this huge empty feeling in my chest. I cannot stop crying whenever I miss the Philippines. 

America has its own culture, one where I cannot or I don‚Äôt want to understand. Especially living in a red state where guns are legal and education is considered insignificant. Sometimes just walking down the street or driving makes me fear for my life.  Life here feels like a competition, you always have to one up the other otherwise you‚Äôll get looked down upon. They‚Äôre just so angry sometimes. 

Even staying with my family is making me so sad. My parents are here, luckily they don‚Äôt stay in the same house as I do, but every time I see them, my trauma resurfaces. We don‚Äôt have that familial connection. They have sacrificed their family for work, work, work, and work. That we never had a relationship. Both verbally abusive parents (though separated, thank God, well dad is both verbally and physically abusive) still breathe down my neck, not letting me pursue the career that I want. They act like they own me even I after I already finished my degree. 

 I feel like there is no purpose for my life. I will be stuck at a career I never chose for myself. I don‚Äôt talk to anybody about this because it sounds so ungrateful. I have little to no money, n√µ emotional support, no one to rely to, no one to ask for guidance, no beaches here, no scenery, nothing to ease my anxiety or depression. I‚Äôm so homesick.  Sometimes I really don‚Äôt see a way out of it. I want to live my life, I don‚Äôt want to sacrifice all my time to work like they expected me to. Maybe I just want to be okay.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/16e396r/here_in_the_us_b·ª©t_terribly_depressed/,t2_76niz8p4d,2023-09-09 19:21:40,0
as a tired friend na akisma,"pagod na me maging available sa friend kong tumatawag or mag chachat lang pag nag away ng jowa nyang abuser. she has a history of depression and she said parang it's coming back dahil dito sa jowa nya na di nya kaya hiwalayan kahit ginagawa na syang punching bag physically and emotionally. she'll call when im working kahit tambak na ako ng workload kakausapin ko muna sya ending mapapa OT ako pag ok na sya she will not reply to my messages asking if how's she doing na. 

this morning while im asleep, nag chat sya and pet peeve ko talaga ang mga nag chachat ng walang context or tatawagin ka muna sa chat.  pagod na pagod ako sa work this week dahil 3 nag resign sa amin so bigat ng workload isang week 2-4 hrs OT. so tulog pa ako mga teh nagising ako ng freaking 5AM dahil sa tawag nya pag sagot ko umiiyak na naman ang gaga. this time, nag sorry ako dahil gusto kong magpahinga dahil ako pagod na pagod na rin ako sa life and wala naman akong mapagsasabihan so di ko na kaya pa mag accommodate pa ng problema ng iba.

most of my friends are like that. ako pa mag aaya sa mga tropa ko pag may isa kaming friend na sad but pag ako nag aaya sa kanila na di ko sasabihin na ""kasi malungkot si ganito"" no one's available. very relate ako sa certain lyrics talaga nung song na Maps na ""I was there for you in your darkest times
I was there for you in your darkest night. But I wonder, where were you? When I was at my worst down on my knees. And you said you had my back. So I wonder, where were you?""

i dont think i can love anymore,"i‚Äôm turning 20 (F), and i‚Äôve only had one boyfriend ever. i am (or was) bisexual, so not feeling any affection nor attraction for anyone is scaring me.

my ex-boyfriend was abusive. for a 14-16 year-old, ang abusive niya. he forbid me from talking with any guys in my class, would take my phone from me, smash it sa sahig pag ayokong ibigay (or kahit magaway kami), and SAd me, verbally abusive, and threatened to k-ll himself if I broke up with him. 

the pandemic helped a lot with the breakup because he had no physical contact with me, and it was easier to not fall for his traps, however, i think the experience scarred me. 

i tried, pretending to be kilig sa isang tao, acting like i like someone (sa ibang people lang, not sa person na yun mismo, ayoko namang makasakit.), and basically fooling myself na nagkakagusto ako sa ibang tao. 

as i said, i‚Äôm bi, so not feeling anything for neither man nor woman is scary. maybe i havent met anyone? pero now, i also just cant see myself with other people. i cant see myself loving someone, getting married, having children.

All of my siblings have failed their marriage.,"Di ko alam kung matatakot na ako mag-asawa or what. (medyo long post)

As mentioned, all of my sisters (3) have failed their marriage.

1st ate, notorious babaero at mayabang yung asawa. She suffered a lot in that relationship, aminado naman siyang hindi siya perfect na asawa. Meron silang 1 anak and ngayon legally married pa rin sila but yung ate ko nasa abroad while yung lalaki andito pinapaaral yung anak nila. He's a good provider naman to their daughter and he respects our parents. Mama at Papa pa rin ang tawag pero meron na rin siyang ibang babaen dinedate. He even treats us to a family outing last week.

2nd naman. Physically abusive yung napangasawa. Lately lang sila naghiwalay. And then my sister got her revenge, she had affairs for God knows how many man. It's not something to be proud of. Muntik ko na siyang itakwil because naapektuhan at natrauma yung mga bata sa ginawa nilang mag-asawa. But now, mukhang at peace na sila na hindi na sila magkasama and my sister's raising her sons on her own.

3rd sister. She's not legally married. Nabuntis ng maaga, iniwan ng asawa di sinusustentuhan. May ka-live in naman na bago, they've been together for more than a decade already. Tbh when it comes to relationship, siya yung parang mas maalam. Pero recently, naghiwalay na rin sila because babaero rin ata. Naging alcoholic naman 'tong kapatid ko and she's seeking therapy.

Me and my brother (4th) sibling. Eh hindi pa nag-aasawa, mukhang mauuna pa naman ako. Inaaya na ako ng kasal ng bf ko (1yr and 6mos together). Pero I'm hesitant not just because di pa stable in life but my sister's situations makes me think twice.

Although alam ko naman sa sarili ko na I'm much better than them kasi medyo natuto naman na ako sa kanila. Also, I think this is God's way of giving us KARMA kasi yung nanay ko eh may history ng panlalalaki dati and it's not discussed sa family. Nabaon nalang sa lupa na di alam ng parents na aware kaming mga anak niya sa ganon.

So, ayun. Mag-asawa pa ba ako or maging rich-asian-tita na lang na maraming pera? ü•≤",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/168k3ej/all_of_my_siblings_have_failed_their_marriage/,t2_7eqc04rt,2023-09-03 09:37:49,50
Extremely tired,"//tw ahead ig, suicide and abuse

Siguro mentally deranged lang ako (18), or sobrang iba interpretation ko sa buhay. I've been verbally and physically abused, lately pag napapagalitan ako I get this inch of fear sa family ko even I'm used and doesn't really care. I'm on my own, mostly on my own since I'm not supported on anything anymore, walang pake sa gustong passion na laging mino-mock, every movement or action seen as stupid or wrong. When I wanted to work to finally become independent and leave this shithole family, my uncle kept pushing me to stop because ""wala kang pupuntahan, hindi ka aasenso sa buhay."" Yes, abusive yung household ko, my mother (trans, once male now female) saw hurting as a way of discipline dahil ganun din sila dinisiplina. My cousin let her (or his, idfc and I disrespect trans-people. HOT TAKE but they're very angry all of their life to someone) anger out on me by hurting me, and family members feel happy about it. Another cousin loved mocking me, making me emotionally and mentally silent losing the passion I love when they're around (her family living in when my grandmother died).

Earlier, I just had some nonsensical thought I told to my bestfriend: ""hurting someone as a minor isn't abuse but discipline, hurting someone as an adult is abuse or violence."" I know I had my wrongs, but as a younger teen years back it's taking all over me knowing and scared na baka maging stuck buhay ko sa kamay ng nanay ko na sobrang strict, which I disrespected so badly dahil di ko nagustuhan yung way of discipline niya. Growing up religiously and graduating from the same catholic school I used to study in, I'm starting to lose my shit that ""maganda school mo, tinuturuan ka ng maganda bakit hindi ka ganyan,"" doesn't reflect to the abuse she's done.

Wanted to commit suicide back then, aunt ko naman was happy seeing the cuts on my arms telling me na ""sige mamatay ka na ayan naman gusto mo."" Never ko siyang mapapatawad, and wala akong pake sa uncle ko na laging sinasabi na ""pamilya lang kaya mong takbuhan."" Kahit na na-experience na lahat ng uncle ko, never kong babalikan pamilya ko knowing na mentally and emotionally I was abused. Knowing my friends helped me more to recover, kahit never ako pinapatuloy sa bahay nila dahil ayaw ng magulang, they did a better job talking to me more than being berated by my uncle na imbes na kausapin ako. And FUCK. HIS. SMUG. SMILE. for every sentence, sobrang mocking.

Please, gusto ko na lumayas sa bahay na to, I'm tired na tiisin yung bullshit control nila, kung pwede lang sana sa ibang pamilya nalang ako inadopt na di tinago yung katotohanan at mas tinuring akong pamilya kesa maging retirement plan na big bragging machine sa ibang family members.

"Being blamed for having autism, having suicidal thoughts","Hi. I have autism and apparently, many people have been aware of it before, calling me baliw,/krungkrung/may saltik and other degrading names especially orgmates who subjected me to physical and psychological violence when I was still 17, a minor.

I just want to rant here before I go the path where people like me are expected to go anyway, since I am living in hell since I was 4 and people around me have been intent in just letting me burn even more painfully, despite me just doing my best to just be alive.

Whenever I speak up just to not end up killing myself, these people, who have connections in many social circles, descend upon me like vultures.

I have done my research since 2015 when I first become aware of my abuse. Currently, people with my level of abuse always has a future that ends in tragedy.

lumipat kami rito sa bahay ng tita ko kasi sobrang abusive ng tatay ko. nananakit siya physically and emotionally, sobrang libog din niya. naninilip siya kapag maliligo ako o kapag iihi ako tapos he would act like it was ""accudental"", napansin din pala ng kapatid ko 'yun kaya he helped me change curtains doon sa CR ng bahay ng tatay ko. nung una akala ko nasa isip ko lang 'yun and accidentally lang talaga. pero nagpipigil na ako ng ihi ko madalas nung nandun pa kami and I don't take showers regularly na rin dahil natatakot na ako na masilipan uli. kahit 'yung skin care ko hindi ko na rin magawa kasi natatakot ako na baka mag-attempt na naman siyang hipuan ako. 

ngayong nandito na ako sa bahay ng tita ko, I take showers regularly na and I started to do my skin care na uli. bumalik na rin appetite ko. hindi ko na kailangan mag-earphones uli para magpatugtog ng malakas kapag nag-aaway sila mama. hindi ko na kailangan pilitin sarili ko na matulog kapag lasing na naman tatay ko para lang hindi ako ma-trigger. wala na rin akong suicidal ideation since we moved out saka nakaka-feel na ako ng emotions ngayon kahit konti, hindi na rin ako numb physically.

I lost my Greatest love to my mental illness,"Me and my first bf of 5yrs broke up 2017. We already saved for our future, we already have plans for our marriage . We already have names for our future kids. Up until now, i cant help but remember how great it is to be loved by someone like him. It's been almost five years. He's already with someone else. All this time i blamed him for falling out of love, but i now know, kasalanan ko. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder year 2016. Kasama ko sya sa lahat ng checkups ko minsan sya pa bumibili ng meds ko. Nun nasa rock bottom ako di nya ako iniwan, kahit na sya ang sumasalo ng sumpong ko. I verbally and physically abused him. Having bipolar cannot justify my abuse. It is my responsibility to fix myself. When he told me he cannot take it anymore, i was angry. Akala ko ba mahal nya ako. Pero sabi nya naubos na daw sya. I can't understand it nuon. Kinakain ako ng sakit at galit ko. Pero kahit sabi nya di na nya ko mahal pag kailangan ko sya he's always there for me. But im in too much pain whenever I see him. Thinking that this guy whom i share my future dreams and goals with, no longer loves me, ang sakit. Kaya ako na ang pumutol ng lahat. I let him go. One year later, nabalitaan ko, may gf na sya. Me, im trying to focus on being better. Nasaktan ako, pero hinga ng malalim, he deserves to be happy. After all the pain that i put him thru, dapat lang na maging masaya sya. Now im really in a better place. Bihira na ako sumpungin, now i can think clearly. I can handle my sumpong way better than before. And pag naalala ko yun mga oras at pagkakataon na nasasaktan ko sya, ambigat sa pakiramdam. Wala sya ibang ginawa kundi mahalin at alagaan ako. But i hurt him, so much. Minsan gusto ko sya kausapin, para mag sorry, pero naiisip ko, di ko na sya dapat guluhin para lang mabawasan yun guilt na nararamdaman ko. I still love him. I will always pray for his happiness, even if that happiness no longer includes me, I'll be forever grateful. Andami ko natutunan sa first heartache ko. It made me wise.

Meron bang tatay na hindi mainitin ang ulo,"Nakakafrustrate lang, feeling ko buong buhay ko kinailangan ko magdeal sa anger issues ng tatay ko. Di siya physically abusive, pero emotionally abusive sya. Ginagawa akong sounding board sa mga problema nya at puro rant sa mga kapatid niyang paulit ulit. Napakabilis magalit, parang ang hirap gumalaw sakanya minsan, iniisip ko palagi may magagawa akong mali. 

Kung kailan akala ko narerepair na relationship namin kasi unti unti ko na syang napapatawad sa trauma na binigay nya sakin nung pagkabata hanggang college, narerealize ko paring di siya nagbago. Andun parin anger issues nya na madali lang biglang magresurface. 

Nagvolunteer pa syang turuan ako magmaneho, pero ang dali lang nya mafrustrate at magalit tuwing di ko nagegets kagad. 

Naiinggit talaga ako sa mga taong close sa tatay nila o kaya mag tatay na sobrang patient sakanila at di mainitin ang ulo. Sobrang foreign tlga ng concept sakin na may ganung tatay pala. Yung makakausap mo nang maayos, mashasharean ng problema, yung emotionally mature enough na kayang macontrol galit nila at maging patient sayo. 

Sobrang sama ko para sabihin to, pero sana iba nalang naging tatay ko.

EDIT: Naiyak ako pagkatapos ng driving lessons. Mas gugustuhin ko nlng magextend ng hours sa driving school kesa magtiis sa ganitong pagtuturo.

I finally got the courage to seek professional help!!!,"After a year of trying, yes!!!! Finally!!! I was able to seek professional help na dahil afford ko na kahit papaano. When I was at my lowest, after my ex financially abused me, I was left with nothing. I had no adult to lean on. 

Parents were too busy and apparently mental health isn't that much of a ""thing"" to my boomer parents.

As panganay, naiintindihan ko naman yun at growing up, I'm just used to getting up on my own. May sakit? Bili ng gamot, magpagaling. Kung may kailangan ako at may gusto ko, I should know how to get it myself. I didnt get the assistance my sisters are getting rn--- and thats okay. Ako naman na nag bibigay nung mga hinahanap hanap ko sa parents ko sa mga sisters ko.

So biggest life set back ko talaga last year after my ex abused me mentally, emotionally, physically and mostly: FINANCIALLY. Lahat ng harm binigay sakin nun and up until now, I'm suffering.

"Sinigawan nung papa ko yung 5 years old ko na kapatid, sinabihan ng bobo etc, tapos nung sinabihan ko, minock ako","long rant ahead 

Nagalit yung tatay ko kasi pinagbibihis siya ng damit ng kapatid ko, katatapos lang kasi maligo. Tapos pinapaabot nya yung damit sa cabinet kasi ayaw niya tumayo sa upuan niya, tapos nung di alam nung kapatid ko bigla ba naman sinigawan tapos sinabihan ng bobo etc. So ako ngayon nainis, nasabihan ko bigla ng, ""nag-anak anak pa kayo, di niyo naman kaya mag-alaga ng anak. Minsan mo na nga lang asikasuhin (kapatid ko) tapos mumurahin mo pa"". Di ko lang napigilan kasi lagi lang naman siya nakahiga don sa upuan niya tapos nagcecellphone. Tapos sabi ba naman sakin, ""shut up ka nalang"". Tapos si mama naman sabay sabat, ""kung di ka nagcocontribute sa bahay, manahimik ka nalang"". 


napasagot ako ulit nang, ""kaming mga anak nga dito nahihirapan"". Scholar ako since maliit ako at ako nagpapa aral sa sarili ko ngayong college pati pambili ng gamit, minsan lang ako manghingi sa kanila. Tapos ang nakakainis pa, minock ako ng tatay ko, sabi ba naman, ""nahihirapan na sila"" sa nakakainis na tono. 


Alam ko na minsan di na ako nagiging magalang, pero kung sila nga di nila magawang maging respectful sa mga anak nila eh. Puro verbal saka physical abuse hinaharap ko sa kanila simula bata ako, saka ngayon na makita ko yun sa kapatid ko na 5 years old, grabe di ko na kaya. Nagiging magalang nalang ako kasi magulang ko sila at nasa poder pa nila ako kasi 18 palang ako.
Ngayon, nagpaparinig nanaman si mama ng, ""wala ka namang natutulong shut up ka nalang"" nang paulit ulit :(( di ko na kaya kasi talaga?? lahat ng paghihirap ko mag aral para matulungan kayo sa gastusin kasi may allowance ako, wala ako natutulong? na ngayong scholar ako sa college, wala ako natutulong?",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/qymgxv/sinigawan_nung_papa_ko_yung_5_years_old_ko_na/,t2_5k9l85lb,2021-11-21 11:54:33,83
My dad is about to go to jail for all his bullshit and my mom wants me to bail him out (as usual),"di ko na keri so let me rant. i have no one to share this with coz it‚Äôs too traumatic to tell.

ayun, a few years ago my dad had an argument with one of our neighbors na nauwi sa suntukan; siya unang nanuntok ok. iirc, it was 10pm and neighbors were drinking sa labas tapos may pa-fireworks pa dahil malapit na ang new year, you know typical pinoy things na nagpapaputok kahit di pa new year. our dogs went crazy kasi takot sa paputok so my dad confronted them sabi nag iingay mga aso dahil sa fireworks yadayadayada. eh dahil lasing si neighbor, medyo pilosopo ata sumagot so my dad punched him (twice daw accdg to records). medyo malakas yata yung pagkakasuntok kasi pumutok (?) yung kilay, if that‚Äôs even a thing. basta malala yata. 

hindi kami mayaman nun, so when they asked for 70k settlement, wala talaga kaming maibigay. so they pressed charges na medyo OA (physical abuse + frustrated murder dafuq) eh mayaman sila neighbor so they got a good lawyer. anyway ayun na after years of hearing sa court, the verdict is finally out. 8 year imprisonment daw.

it‚Äôs either kulong siya, or we pay them 200k para i-drop daw ang charges. my bros and i talked about it, parang sila they just wanna pay the 200k. but me? i want that mothefucker in jail. he deserves it. sobrang samang tao ng tatay ko guys. haha he deserves more than 8 years. and honestly that‚Äôs what i told my bros. and feeling nila masyado akong masama, napasama daw ako ng maynila lol but honestly ever since I moved out doon ako naliwanagan sa lahat ng ginagawa nila. they also do drugs btw. shabu pa! mga lech talaga. so yung pinaghihirapan ko napupunta sa drugs at ang tanga ko dati kasi kala ko ok lang yun? hahaha brainwashed ng mga magulang ang mga probinsiyano/a.

di ko kinakausap pamilya ko ngayon kasi di sila agree na hayaan ko makulong tatay ko. but fuck that man he deserves it talaga. he abused me and my cousins nung bata pa kami and it still lingers in my core memory and lately it‚Äôs been resurfacing, halos every night i‚Äôm having nightmares ever since i found out about this makukulong thing. di ako nakakatulog ng maayos coz idk i feel guilty? may really small part of me na nagsasabi na i should help him perk fuck i hate that man so much for everything he‚Äôs put me thru. i can‚Äôt even go to therapy kasi i can‚Äôt talk about the abuse he did. ayan kaya kong i-type but i can‚Äôt physically talk about it coz it leaves me paralyzed. idk

basta ayun. fucked up ng buhay ko shet. haha",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/yb4gls/my_dad_is_about_to_go_to_jail_for_all_his/,t2_31ghhqmm,2022-10-23 09:29:17,7
I want to expose you ‚Äî ex for 7 years,"I have an ex for 7 years, we were college sweethearts. I was 18 back then and he was 21 or 22 i think. My major is business ad while he was taking veterinary that time but unfortunately hindi sya nakagraduate ng doctor. Last year nya dapat sa vet pero nagkaroon sila financial problem and yun parents nya hindi na sya sinupport. Dun na ko tumulong sa kanya financially. Pero hindi sya pumapasok sa class nya. Nagsorry sya sakin that time pero alam mo yun parang di sya nagbago? 

Now, before we broke up it was my finals exam. Btw, nagtuloy ako ng law and he knows na sobrang demanding ng law school. Pero throughout my journey sa law school lagi sya nakikisabay sa exam ko. Dun ko na narealize na ayoko na pero hindi madaling break up ung binigay nya sakin. Chinat nya relatives ko pati siniraan nya ko sa mga girls na kinausap nya habang hiwalay kami. And ngayon may new gf sya tapos finflex nila isat isa sa social media. 

Wala naman sakin if magkagf sya agad habang pinipilit nyang makipagbalikan sakin. Pero un trauma na naiwan nya sakin ang nahihirapan ako. He physically, mentally and sexually abused me. I have a restraining order against him after break up kasi sinaktan nya ko physically and nagpunta sya sa apartment and ginulo nya yun gamit ko. Hindi ko sya tinuloy na VAWC kasi iniisip ko un stress din na madudulot sakin since i was also diagnosed of Major Depressive Disorder with Anxiety. 

Alam nyo masakit sa pagiging victim? Yun trauma naiwan sayo pero yun abuser mo andun masaya na parang walang nangyari. 
Sinabi ko to sa family nya and dun sa girl ginawa sakin with documents pero walang naniwala mas matapang pa yun girl. May piangsamahan naman daw kami. Ganun terms, which is dialogue ng ex ko kasi malakas syang mang gaslight. 

Ang unfair lang kasi like it was nothing tapos sya nakakapagyabang sa soc med na parang ang perfect ng mga buhay nila.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/14hf114/i_want_to_expose_you_ex_for_7_years/,t2_9jkozcyek,2023-06-24 08:52:35,9
