I (F20) was sexually abused by my boyfriend (M21) years ago. I am still with him and I am relapsing.,"TW: SA 

Back when we were dating in high school, I was a naive person. I didn’t think much of the possibilities of me being sexually assaulted because all I thought of was getting to know people and having a boyfriend.

 At that time, I was 16 and he was 17, and we were both in highschool. I agreed that we go to a motel so that we can kiss and cuddle. As naive young girl, I believed that that was all his intentions. But, unfortunately, it turns out that he wanted more than that. So he touched me in places that I wasn’t ready to explore, despite me telling him “no” a couple of times. Eventually, I just gave in because I got horny and I already thought of myself as ‘dirty’. So if I was already used, and I was already horny, why not go through it na diba? 

So ayun, this was the main reason why I didnt realize na I was violated already. A year after that, mga 2021 siguro, I realized na what he did was sexual assault. And it did traumatize me a lot to the point na I would cry all night thinking about how dirty and used I was. I did break up with him at that time, pero nagkabalikan din kami kasi hindi ko kinaya (medyo tanga). 

Btw, ung experience na nasabi ko isnt the only SA experience I had with him, pero its one of the firsts and most disturbing. 

So fast forward years after, naging okay naman kami and he did change na (i hope so). Pero I heard na he told his friend about what happened sa amin and not in a remorseful way, pero in a way na parang di sha big deal na. That is RLLY disgusting and it made me relapse big time. 

A part of me knows na its right if I break up with him, pero paminsan iniisip ko din na our relationship wasnt ALL bad. We had good times and bad times. When I weigh in the things that we did na masaya kami, parang naiiyak nalang ako kasi ayaw ko rin un ilet go. he is my number 1 go-to person, especially in college since we both go to the city for school. Knowing na losing my perpetrator also means losing my number 1 go-to person is such a BIG ache in my heart. 

What should I do? was our relationship doomed from the moment he SA-ed me? Was there really a chance? Can we still rise above this? 

If anybody has the same experience as me, please tell me whats the best thing to do.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/15a9dlx/i_f20_was_sexually_abused_by_my_boyfriend_m21/,t2_o3d6lzs4,2023-07-26 23:47:11,1
"Help, TW: abuse","TL;DR

Hello guys, I need help or suggestions. 

I (F20) broke up months ago with my ex partner (F21) that I had a relationship with for two years, the reason I broke up with her is her uncontrollable anger issues and I felt like it is a hopeless case kasi I gave all of my patience and understanding naman but it is not enough anymore to save everything. I cannot endure being in a relationship na kinakaladkad ako sa kalsada, sinisigawan in public and worst case scenario nag e eskandalo sa kahit saan na lugar. Ang reason niya, ""Wala naman nakaka kilala sa atin, ano pakelam nila. Di naman nila tayo maaalala"". Which is the most non-sense excuse I've ever heard. Hindi ko kaya maging rehabilitation center para sa isang tao na hindi tinutulungan ang sarili (she refuses to go to a psychiatrist kahit may decent job naman siya) and the worst is, I came from an emotional abusive relationship before her and ayoko dumating ulit sa point na masisira na naman ako plus the fact na unti unti ko na a adapt toxic traits niya which is very alarming for me kasi hindi ako nag gro grow as a person with her.

Before we broke up, I told her straight up na I am not willing to save the relationship anymore but instead I am willing to be her friend pa rin kasi di ko naman matatanggi she helped me at some point in my life.

This time, I managed to move on in months with the mindset na I learned from my first relationship before her, I gave everything naman na and obviously the relationship is toxic na. We were just hurting each other, I know I am not a perfect partner din but there are things you could not pursue anymore.

Months after our break up, I met someone new and we're starting to get real close. Hanggang sa naging kami after a few more months of ligawan. The problem is, my ex has a new partner na rin but she keeps on posting up until now saying na ""I'll never forget those who left me specially YOU the one who made me believe you'll be there for me"". 

Mind you, I offered to be her friend pa rin naman kasi I could not be a partner for her anymore. I cut her off completely lang kasi nga she does not respect my new relationship, na ang dami niya parinig sa socmed na hindi ko ma gets WHAT'S THE POINT SINCE SHE HAS A PARTNER NAMAN NA.

I could not unfriend her or block her from that account since na experience ko na yung may anonymous posting sa circle of friends group namin pertaining to me, shaming my partner and I. Ang worst pa roon, may nakiki sakay pa na hindi ko rin naman kilala at all. It seems like they're all a leech sucking every chismis/entertainment na makita nila. Even my internet friends ko na sobrang ka close ko, nagulat ako sinisiraan na rin ako. 

So far, nag lay down nang onti yung pag po post niya but recently she posted nga something na related na naman sa akin. Hindi ko ma gets dahil may partner naman na siya and why would she still bother to post anything for me. 

Ang alarming din na may dummy account na nag me message sa second account ko na naka follow sa account ng kapatid ko (sa RA ko, no one knows my second account so I think it is possibly her), I tried to reply saying hi but that account deactivated immediately after seeing my reply.

What should I do guys? I blocked her from everything and deleted my second account since I don't want to have any connections with her and my so called old friends, but I am scared pa rin for my privacy and for my partner. Nakaka inis lang kasi she knows where I live kaya until now very cautious ako pag lumalabas or pumupunta kung saan saan kasi ayoko maka bunggo siya somewhere and deal with her, knowing how scandalous she is, how loud her voice was and how she drags me around. I can say na medyo may trauma pa rin sa akin yung mga kinikilos niya that's why I don't wanna see her. 

I apologize for the messy construction of my post but I just really need some opinion or suggestion. Thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/10ea7q5/help_tw_abuse/,t2_un0ytv51,2023-01-17 19:40:56,1
Is there a way for the emotionally abused boyfriend (28M) to have the full custody of his baby (3B) from his emotionally abusive girlfriend (28F)?,"May way ba para mapunta sa lalaki yung baby dahil sobrang abusive ng girlfriend nya?

"i (25F) want to move out because my mother (46F) is physically, emotionally and mentally abusive and i need a safer space to heal. ","hi redditph! it’s my first time posting here but before i get this off my chest, i just wanna say i appreciate all of you here.

so, here goes. (TW: abuse, sexual harassment, suicide attempt)

short bg, i’m 25F and the eldest daughter of a broken family. parents are separated but both already have their own partners now. i have 2 younger brothers, aged 23 and 16. 

i’ve only been working for 2+ months because i graduated at 24. i never stopped school, i just transferred schools due to 3 separate incidents involving sexual assault, sexual harassment from a prof and theft by fraud. 

why am i telling you this? because it’s part of the reason why i want to move out—my mother did not offer me support in circumstances like these wherein i needed the counsel of a parent. 

she didn’t believe i was sexually assaulted by a classmate. she instead screamed at me and asked me if i was drunk when it happened, what i was wearing, and if the guy who assaulted me was my boyfriend. (did not drink, was wearing my uniform and the guy was bi—he had a bf and all.) i reported it to my former uni but also to no avail.

she never did anything about my prof who continuously harassed me for 2 years. i explained to her countless times that he kept asking me out to dinner and drinks, just me and him. he also keeps inviting me to chat through secret conversations in messenger. i never budged so he failed me on one of his classes. i lost my chance to be a dean’s lister because of him. she just shrugged it off like it was nothing.

although, she did something to my classmate/dormmate who failed to pay her share for rent that she borrowed from us. she had her blottered at 2 barangays. 

these are just a few examples of the challenges i faced in life. since then, i’m sad to say, i had to go through worse stuff and my mother still wasn’t there even after i reached out. 

apart from that, there’s also the pathological lying, violent tendencies and deep unresolved anger issues. 

lately i just realized she constantly lies about our family. she had been telling people that she paid for my tuition even if my dad did. (he rightfully deserves the credit.) the worst one was one time we were together and someone asked if i was her daughter, she denied it. 

there’s also the violence i can’t take anymore. whenever she gets upset with us while driving, she goes into a road rage. she speeds through highways to get her point across. she throws things at us and somehow i always get the brunt of it. the worst one happened last year and i finally had the courage to record it (sound recording). it was clear in the audio that she was hitting me while i was telling her it hurts. 

in 2014, i was diagnosed with major depressive disorder during my parents’ initial break up. in 2020, i relapsed and (shamefully & regretfully) tried to take my own life. now i even developed severe anxiety and a slight eating disorder. i’m only 38kg at 5’2”. 

there are still nights when i feel too overwhelmed. but i never went to my mother again. i’m more scared of hearing what she’ll say than of hearing my own last breath. 

i know that i make mistakes, sometimes it’s really my fault why she’s mad. i’m not the perfect daughter. i already constantly beat myself up for it—without them needing to add to it. 

but i finally see now that i don’t have to be perfect to be loved and cared for. i don’t deserve to be hurt anymore.

right now, my simple wish is to start my healing journey, far away from her. to have my own safe space, to establish new boundaries and to have a place to finally start living after being on survival mode for so long. 

i worry about my brothers but after i asked them, they confirmed that she never hit them, unlike me. and they know enough not to depend on her for emotional support. 

one of my brothers will be graduating and working soon too. but i promised my youngest brother that they both have the option to live with me if they wish. i only survived because of them. i want to give them a better life. 

but the thing is, even if my mother has been a great burden to my emotional, mental and physical wellbeing, she is still my mother. i still want to move out with her approval and blessing. i still want to support her financially and maybe when time comes, even more than that. because maybe i’m not the only one who needs therapy. i want to help her. when she’s ready too. 

me, i’m finally ready to put myself first. but how do i even start telling her that i’m moving out? do you have any advice for a situation like mine?

thanks, redditph! ❤️‍🩹",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/1armukf/i_25f_want_to_move_out_because_my_mother_46f_is/,t2_pid2dds1a,2024-02-16 02:48:15,1
My (23F) sister(38F) got back with her abusive SO(32M) of 6 years. She was keeping the abuse part as a secret from our dad but I told him anyway after nila magbalikan. I'm afraid she will not confide to me after snitching and/ or feel welcomed anymore.,"\*Long post\*  
  
My ate is a single mom. Her previous relationships has also been rough (most of them cheated on her, too including her ex-husband) before she met, tawagin ko siyang Mark, 6 years ago. Mark was her co-worker turned her BFF. Then they've became a couple. Mukha namang masaya ate ko so we let her relationship with Mark foster.  
  
Then nagsimula siya magkuwento sa akin how controlling Mark is. Blocking all her male friends and coworkers sa socials niya, sinasabihan siya ng ""malandi"" ""b\*tch"" ""sl\*t"" ""homewrecker"" because of the way she dresses. Mark has not even metioned to his family na single mom ang ate ko dahil nakakahiya raw. She also confided na madalas siyang bineberate at sinisigawan in public, madalas sa office spaces nila kapag may nangyaring di nagustuhan ni guy. Pero sabi ng ate ko is magalitin lang daw si Mark. Ate made me promise never ikuwento sa tatay namin, I agreed kasi minsan lang siya mag-open up.  
  
Just for context, nakatira si ate and her daughter with our tatay and me. So, kada may away sila, like clockwork, pupunta si Mark sa bahay para sunduin ate ko for a date or road trip. Madalas nawawala siya for almost a week. Badtrip tatay namin sa pinapakitang attitude ni Mark dahil kung saan saan dinadala ate ko ng wala man lang pasabi. This has also caused a rift between her and her daughter. My sister says that malaki at matanda na siya and she could make her own decisions na, so we let her. Ate also started inviting Mark sa bahay so they can work together during their work shifts (WFH setup) minsan overnight, minsan tumatagal ng 3-4 days nag stay yung guy sa bahay. Aminado kami, we have never been welcoming kay Mark kada andito siya. This has been going on for 5 years na sila.  
  
Three months ago, ate found out Mark was cheating with their coworker. Mark blocked her from all his socials, even sa work gc cold treatment. Anyway, off contact. Then just last weekend, bigla bigla na lang pumunta sa bahay si Mark. Ate said na pumunta raw si Mark kasi may sasabihin sa kanya. It's been 4 days na pero di pa rin umaalis si Mark dito sa bahay. Every morning umaalis din silang dalawa para sa swimming lessons. Ilang beses ko nang pinagsabihan ate ko so I snitched sa tatay namin. I told him about the abuse ate has been going through before their breakup.  
  
After their swimming class, nag-dm sa akin si ate asking if may ulam sa bahay. I asked her why, sabi niya is because gusto raw kami ipagluto ni Mark dahil nahihiya siya na matagal na siyang nagstay sa bahay. And then nag chat ulit si ate sabi niya ang hirap magsabi at magreklamo sa bahay na to. Pinapagalitan na pala siya ni papa sa phone. Nagalit siya sa akin, saying na nagababago na raw si Mark and kasalanan naman daw niya yung mga nangyari sa kanya before. That was my last straw and sinabi ko na sa kanya without filter kung gaano katanga mga ginagawa niyang desisyon. Sinabi ko rin na if yung anak niya ang gumagawa ng mga ginagawa niya ngayon, di siya matutuwa. She said I was below the belt. Gusto lang daw niya maging masaya and to live in the moment and rn masaya siya with Mark. Puro trabaho lang din daw siya kaya kailangan niya ng outlet. Also kaya hindi pa rin naalis si Mark sa bahay dahil gusto kaming kausapin to apologize. Sabi ko BS to. I told her kung gusto talaga bumawi ni Mark, hindi dapat siya magluto dapat lumugar siya. After nito di siya nagreply.  
  
Should I have not snitched ba? Feeling ko if may mas malalang mangyayari sa kanila ni Mark ngayon, mas hindi niya na sasabihin. Also, I was too judgmental of her and she would not feel welcomed anymore. Should I apologize? Or should I just leave her alone na lang?  
  
tldr; older sis has been in an abusive SO for five years and is now back with the said SO. I have snitched sa tatay namin about sa nangyari sa relationship nila. Older sis got furious and I have said hurftul words to her. Now, I'm afraid she would not confide to me nor feel welcomed if sht hits the fan.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/14fnltt/my_23f_sister38f_got_back_with_her_abusive_so32m/,t2_py61c61o,2023-06-22 07:56:25,6
My (23F) gf confessed to me (22M) about her terrible childhood experience (sexual abuse) . I don’t want to let him get away with it.,"
For context me and my gf are about 6 years na in relationship. Last year nag confess siya sakin about her childhood trauma.

This is a throwaway account and I am new to this subreddit. Ngayon lang ako nag lakas loob mag post dahil until now I’m still shocked and disgusted sa nangyari.


My girl is a very mabait na anak especially in her parents, yung tipong isang sabi lang ng magulang niya ay susunod na agad siya no questions asked. 
Then inamin niya sakin na in her childhood, her tito sexually abused her but not in a magnitude na nirape siya. I don’t want to go to any specific details but I think I should say it na din para ma picture and malaman yung magnitude nung nangyare. “Her uncle suck her nips when she was young” napaka gago no? Like wtf? She’s like 7 years old at that time. 

Tinanong ko bat di nya na sinumbong and she said that she was scared. And thinking na her uncle still lives with them until now which is their neighbor in their place is very concerning to me kahit matagal na ito nangyari. Until now ayaw pa din niya ipa sabi kahit kanino because she fears na magkaka gulo gulo pamilya niya. It’s true but it is still wrong.

What is the best thing to do? I think that child molesters deserve a spot in hell and their actions should have serious consequences. Tagal na din po kase bumabagabag sa isip ko ito until now.

I [M32] think I'm being emotionally abused by my 5-year live in partner [F28]. She randomly spouts infidelity jokes(?) and brags that masturbating is better than us having sex (she always asks for it). She's also very cautious when I'm glancing at her phone while she can freely use my phone anytime.,"I might be overreacting but this has been bothering me for quite some time now. There is also a time when I almost had a mental breakdown because of this. I'm not sure if it's just her sense of humor but it definitely is taking a toll on my mental health.

Breaking up with her isn't necessarily a good idea because we have a toddler daughter. I mean, I still love her and our daughter but it gets worse whenever she does it. I can laugh at it before but now, I am showing disgust.

Am I overreacting? And please give me any advice on how I can survive this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/17jswp6/i_m32_think_im_being_emotionally_abused_by_my/,t2_mulso4une,2023-10-30 21:03:23,8

I met this guy on that app and weve been talking for good weeks now.
Weve been on dates and really did hit it off. But one night we just had a serious talk about our pasts and that he revealed abt his abusive ex. It washed me down to feeling sorry for him because he even have photos of him having bruises and wounds from his ex. It was so TOXIC that he had to leave, now I dont know. I want to give him some genuine love and care but at the same time im scared if Id push thru this. I dont want him to reflect his traumas on me. I fought and cried my way out of my past relationship and I dont think I can handle one that can cause me pain again. Although, my bestfriend (23F) also was a victim of physically abusive relationship and is now in a happy and stable one. Help, coz theres a side of me that wants to date him and give him genuine love and a side of me just wanting him to be my friend.

My GF tells me to leave her because she might cheat on me because of her past,"I'd appreciate if you fully read the text. Thank you.

Me (28M) and my girlfriend (26) are 14 months already into our relationship. Regardless to say, we're in a rough patch right now, so I'll be direct as much as possible.

She was sexually abused many times in the past before I first met her, and she is a legal PWD cardholder because of psychosocial issues. Back in 2018 or 2019, she was diagnosed for at least three disorders, including PTSD and MDD. She took medication until she stopped. I don't yet know when she stopped taking it.

During those years of taking medication, she was still with her ex, who had physically and sexually abused her more than a few times. They broke up in February 2021, after 5 years of relationship, when she found out he cheated on her.

I matched with her on a dating app on November that year, and we started dating on December. On February, we got together officially.

Yesterday, she went back to the psychiatrist to get a medical certificate. After her online psych session, she was crying and I asked why. She said the doctor ordered her to take medication again. She told me that taking that medication makes her numb, since it has side effects that makes her indifferent or apathetic.

She also confessed that she felt SHE MIGHT CHEAT ON ME because of the medication's side effects. She admitted to me that she cheated on her ex then by going on a date with another guy, whom she refused to identify. She did not want to elaborate further what happened with the other guy. But she said she was taking medication then so she didn't feel anything at all when she did it.

Now, she said I could go or I can leave her so I wouldn't risk getting cheated on by her if she takes that medication, which she really fears might damage our relationship and hurt me. She even calls herself a forever cheater for betraying her abusive ex.

I just want to know, what can I do or say to her? What can I do to save this relationship? My heart aches while I'm writing this. I appreciate any sort of help, thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/12ufn7w/my_gf_tells_me_to_leave_her_because_she_might/,t2_9pot9rpre,2023-04-22 03:37:13,16
"My bf(M25) going to crazy work pressure, ends up frustration up on me(F23) I work in a stable MNC with a good work-life balance, while he's in a demanding startup job.","TL;DR My boyfriend (25) and I (23) have been together for a year. I work in a stable MNC with a good work-life balance, while he's in a demanding startup job. His hectic schedule and an abusive manager have put immense pressure on him. We rarely have time together, and the stress has led to him occasionally venting frustration on me, including verbal abuse. I understand it's a tough phase, but the toxic work environment persists. I'm afraid to speak up, as any wrong word triggers him.

Despite my efforts to support him with gestures like sending chocolates, gifts etc, the growing frustration is affecting me too. 

At times, I sense that I might be a hindrance to his career growth, feeling like I'm in the way of his hustle. I recognize the importance of him focusing on his career now, and I've communicated this concern to him. He acknowledged that it's not about me but rather the challenges he faces at work.

"""as if that’s anything new to you"" that's what my [20F] partner said when [20M] i called her out for being violent.","Last night, we were playing videogames and drinking with friends in one room. whenever she gets beaten by me sa game, napipikon siya and namamalo or nang hahampas. im aware na whole day na siya napipikon sakin because late ko na siya sinundo from her place. im very well aware of this behavior of hers, and im fine with it naman since onti lang and kadalasan ay di naman masakit. i even made some jokes na kapag sinaktan pa niya ulit ako id kiss her, she said ""ew"". so we went for a few rounds of mortal kombat, and yung last match before ako umayaw, sumobra siya sa pananakit while saying how buong araw na siya napipikon sakin, when i tried to stop her slapping and punching me by grabbing her arms, she used her feet naman to kick me. that's when di ko na muna siya pinansin hanggang umuwi kami, before sumakay sa car nagpapapansin siya and she's trying to hold my hand, that's when i said na huwag niya muna akong hawakan. 

when we got home, she messaged ""ano ba problem mo"". that's when i told her na she's being violent, then she said the title. i got so pissed off sa sinabi niya idk how to explain bakit, pero same energy siya nung mga nagsasabi na ""ganto talaga ako eh"" or ""dati pa naman ako ganto"". i then called her weirdo for that response, i explained na sumobra siya earlier, na i can laugh it off naman most of the time, pero nung time na yun sumobra talaga siya, because ramdam ko talaga na gusto niya manakit. i called her being abusive. i said ""idk what will happen to our relationship sa future if hindi mo ibago yan"" then slept.

she replied this morning. she apologized so formally about her behavior and actions it sounds fake, but i know naman na it's sincere. after her apology, she then called me out for being unfair. how when she asks naman biglaan sometimes about her behavior and if okay lang ba ako, i say okay lang ako and im fine with it, because at those times naman im fine and cool talaga sa actions niya, i only got mad nung sumobra na siya because there's only so much i can handle. she felt like my messages last night are biglaan/dropped all at once. wala raw ba chances na i brought that up earlier, kaysa blowing it off to her with one moment, calling her a weirdo and doubting the future of our relationship. 

""you were not even subtle about the chances of me being “abusive”. i’m hurt that you even thought i will resort to that, especially with you."" she said this sa last line. idk why she put quotation marks sa word na abusive lol, it's either she's so unaware, or maybe mali lang ako ng definition of abuse.

I (F20) think I might be cheating on my boyfriend (M23) without meaning to,"I (F20) am probably dating two people at once, I don't know what to do

I'm young I know, I have a boyfriend (23 years old, Graduate with a job that isn't so stable, He could do better in life however he's not moving) of almost two years now, at first I was so in love. He did everything right. He was there and he helped me figure out so much about myself and learn some lessons to deal with the world. As time passed he started withdrawing, Barely doing anything. I started feeling like I'm not even getting the bare minimum. We started fighting and sometimes he gets verbally abusive but afterwards he'd apologize. Until he stopped being abusive, He stopped everything. He's barely even there. He's not talking to me more than 5 minutes a day. He's not available whenever I need him. We go out once a week maximum and it's probably me initiating it. He never plans any dates it's always 'whatever you want'. I've recently lost all my friends and I feel like I'm very vulnerable at this time. I'm not saying I'm an angel but I do my best to be with him and what he claims is his best is barely the minimum because he says he's depressed and he doesn't wanna leave his bed in the morning but he wouldn't go to a therapist for help. I'm genuinely scared that I'll continue my studies and try my best to be a successful person and evolve. And he'd still be right where he was when I first met him.
I've been talking to a guy online for about a week now (25 years old), He lives a continent away. He's made me feel more than my boyfriend has in 2 years. He's interested in details, how my day went, what did I do today, how am I. He makes me feel like I'm being taken care of and he's literally a continent away. I love my boyfriend so much and I'm very overwhelmed to the point where I can't think anymore. Whenever I think I just start feeling guilty cause that's partially cheating.

"My (21F) boyfriend (22M) tells me that he loves me, but he consistently hurts me (emotionally and mentally)","It has been a year since we began our relationship, and he still seems unsure of what he wants. We agreed to be transparent and truthful with each other, but we find ourselves arguing for the same reasons repeatedly. After each argument, we discuss ways to improve and make resolutions to prevent future conflicts. However, none of these solutions seem to manifest effectively, as he often forgets and fails to learn from his mistakes.

Another issue is his lack of emotional openness during our arguments. While I openly express my feelings, he tends to blame me for my traumas and emotions. When confronted directly about his mistakes, he initially denies them, leading to prolonged arguments and exhaustion. He even resorts to shouting at me, despite my repeated requests for him to stop. This constant cycle of conflict requires me to constantly adjust and make unilateral efforts to maintain our relationship.

I am always willing to invest time and energy in our relationship, even though we live 12 kilometers apart. However, when I request the same from him, he often cites busyness as an excuse. This becomes even more disheartening when he readily agrees to sex but shows reluctance towards fulfilling my simple requests, such as inviting him out to eat.

This one-sided dynamic has become deeply frustrating. Even on our anniversary, my attempt to surprise him with an air fryer (something he both needs and desires) was met with no reciprocation. I had worked hard to save for this gift, and I had planned it for months.  I don't need grand gestures; even the smallest effort would be appreciated. Not only did I receive nothing in return, but he also failed to make any effort for our date, leading to a disappointing outcome. 

I just want my love reciprocated. I'm tired of self-doubt despite knowing I'm not at fault. I prioritize him and give him what's normal in a relationship. I just want to feel loved and appreciated, and I want him to make the slightest effort and learn from his mistakes.

What did I ever do wrong? Should I remain in this relationship, or are there any steps I can take to improve it?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/18fm85z/my_21f_boyfriend_22m_tells_me_that_he_loves_me/,t2_vkj0wkr3,2023-12-11 12:28:02,10

GF (23F) toxic family is draining me (26M) into thinking I should end this relationship because of stress,"

I (M26) and gf (F23) have been dating for a year now. She's my first ever girlfriend and I she's means everything to me. However, the last 3 months I have been thinking about the long term plans for us and unfortunately I am having doubts about us being together. Here are the reasons.

My partner is all I could have asked as she keeps me motivated to become a better person. However, her family situation, I am afraid will effect this relationship. She lives with her mom and two sisters where is not so pleasant to live in. Her dad is not allowed in the home because of his abusive behavior and her parents are going through a naster divorce. On-top of that, her mom is being negative to her all time due to the stress she has. Second, her older sister just gotten out of abusive relationship with her ex where he crashed her two vehicles. The ex is a criminal who had ties to gangs across the city, right now he is in prison but still keeps in contact with older sister despite her getting assaulted by him which is strange. The car was leased, the older sister and the mom are paying back the car which has 60k in debt. My partner's old sister does not take responsibility for the damage she has caused to the family and does not want to help out her mom in paying back the car. This effects greatly to my gf who now has anxiety because all the hurt she has caused. Her younger sister is steering to a similar path to the older sister where she does not care about mindset. Her mom does not care to correct the two daughters as she is working tirelessly to pay the bills and put food on the table. Also on-top of that her dad friends spies me and my gf to see what we are doing as he legally cannot get in contact with my gf.

Right now my gf is diagnosed with anxiety because all of what's going on with her family. She does not have really much friends or have a good support system, she has only me at this point. I came to know more of her family situation about 5 months ago into the relationship. I personally feel overwhelmed too , but I too know I need to be the bigger person in this relationship and help. However it s very exhausting to put up with her negative toxic family. I just want to know if worth pursuing into this relationship. I do feel like once I marry to her I will inherently have all these problems with me, idk if that's something I would want because I cannot deal with such stress at this point 

I tried to have a conversation about her how I feel and she tells me your a man you should be strong enough to care and support me. Which I responded I do, however looking at the long term picture it does not look promising as the family situation will greatly hurt this relationship due to stress and anxiety.

My question is should I still purse in this relationship and hope everything will turn out fine or end things and move on?

Idk how to feel if I truly want her or not, I feel like I am in a trap tbh, any advice will help",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/190dbw3/gf_23f_toxic_family_is_draining_me_26m_into/,t2_rjegkd2z0,2024-01-07 07:21:44,5
I (20F) feel like im being too emotionally attached and reliant on my first ever bf (23M) which scares me.,"Me (20F) and my boyfriend (23M) have been together for almost a year (will be in march), he is my first boyfriend as well as I am his first girlfriend. Our relationship is really healthy, we are legal in both sides, and we know each other’s friends. It has been a routine for us to meet each other weekly, usually he goes to my house and we just watch movies and bond, but sometimes we also go outside. I’ve been really accustomed to that and have found it very comforting to the point that I look forward to it every start of the week (we meet at saturdays). At times where we suddenly can’t meet, it affects me A LOT, I don’t just get sad, I legit cry. I don’t tell him this so he doesn’t get guilty whenever he can’t meet me, but idk I just get scared of the fact that I am becoming needy for the presence of my boyfriend. 

Honestly I think its because of my issues and traumas, I come from an emotionally abusive broken family, I find it very hard to really open myself up to someone because of this as to why I don’t really entertain guys before. But now that I have my boyfriend, Idk I discovered that I can be very needy pala. 

Im just scared because I don’t want to be a clingy annoying girlfriend and I am also scared of being too vulnerable. Because of my past traumas I want to be strong onf on my own but having my bf is changing that and it scares me.

Am I just overthinking this? Is this normal for a first relationship? any advice on how I should handle my feelings?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/199548q/i_20f_feel_like_im_being_too_emotionally_attached/,t2_hueqzxhy8,2024-01-18 03:21:52,30
I (F20) want to break up with my bf (M20) because he keeps talking about topics I specifically told him not to,"Okay so I (f20) have been with my bf (m24) for a year now. In full honestly most of it has been great. If we have small “fights” (which usually are superficial) we talk it out and in a few hours we get back to normal.
The issue here: sadly when I was 14 I was in a “relationship” with someone 16 years older than me (f32). Sadly I was abused for months. I don’t want to get into detail but something important is that she had several addictions including drugs and alcohol. I’ve never done either but was in a lot of dangerous situations because of that. Again I won’t go into details on what happened with her but I can say I’m still extremely traumatized.
I don’t mind if my friends sometimes smoke sometimes or stuff like that, I’m not a fan but I try to ignore it. But with my partners I cannot stand it. I don’t prohibit but I just tell them “if you are gonna do it just be careful, don’t do it when I’m around and don’t tell me about it” of course I explain the reason why.
So that’s what I did with him and at first he was really understanding. But as time passed he kept making comments when he did it and he was happy to tell me, like if he was telling me about something he did on his everyday life and it’s super casual. And of course I was extremely uncomfortable and told him I didn’t like that I he kinda got mad but let it go. That happened plenty of times. He makes jokes about drugs and how sometimes I’m a bit stiff about it and u should try it. Then he laughed and says it’s just a joke and he would never force me to do it. At this point I just ignore him.
So yesterday we went to see a movie. Sometimes when I give my opinions and I’m really passionate I can act a bit intense lol, and angry? It’s not the first time someone tells me that and I’m working on it because a lot of times I want to say something good or positive but the way I see it seems different. Anyways, we were talking about the movie and I did that, he got kinda quiet and I asked him what was wrong. He told me that he doesn’t like when I do that and that it makes him feel bad. I’m not gonna go into detail about that because it’s not important. I know what I did wrong and asked him when did I make him feel like that. He gave me some examples and then he said “when I talk about drugs you just ignore it or act like you don’t want to listen” 
I swear I froze right there, I didn’t have words. I just stared crying and told him he knows why I that I don’t have to give him any more explanation. 
I was so sad and confused because was he actually upset about it? Let me make clear that this has happened like 5 times? He’s not a big drug user so it’s not something that happens every single day. I just felt so attacked and ignored. Why would somebody say something like that. Like he actually thinks I should just take it even though it causes me so much anxiety. I think about my abuser every single day. Smells, songs, movies everything reminds me of her. 
I don’t know what to do. I feel like it was something’s extremely insensitive and just mean. 
I don’t know if I can trust him anymore
Am I exaggerating? Because I think that if someone who I appreciate told me something like that I would respect it. 
Should I talk to him about it again and keep working on my relationship or just go and break up with him?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/1an5lq8/i_f20_want_to_break_up_with_my_bf_m20_because_he/,t2_jsvsxlogw,2024-02-10 10:24:22,1
My ex contacted me 7 years after our toxic relationship ended to “catch up”. He apologized and told me na naapektuhan sya nung nawala ako.,"
My ex (34M) and I (35F) used to date (6 months) while attending our grad studies. Things got toxic (he was verbally abusive at nambababae) which led me to abruptly cut him off my life. Blocked sa lahat ng socmed and nagpalit ako ng number. Every attempt to communicate with me ay failed dahil ayoko na talaga. 7 years had passed na walang contact. Nagkaroon na rin kami ng kanya-kanyang relasyon. 

Fast forward to present, we both attended an event and parehas na rin kaming single. Nakuha nya yung number ko and he called me up, asking kung pwede kami mag-usap. Considering na ang tagal na nung “issue” namin at hindi ko na yun naiisip, nag-okay ako sa kanya. Nagmeet kami sa dati naming tambayan na resto and nag-usap lang ng mga ganap sa buhay. Bigla syang nagsorry about our past, na nagulat daw sya nung nawala na ako sa kanya at naapektuhan sya nung nagbreak kami. Hindi naman daw talaga nawala sa isip nya yung nangyari na nung nagkaroon sya ng chance na makausap ako, hindi na nya pinakawalan yun. 

To be honest, hindi ko alam kung anong mararamdaman ko to think na ang tagal-tagal na nun. What do you guys think about this? Applicable ba dito yung sinasabi nila na “they always come back”? O inuuto lang ako nun?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/15cqni4/my_ex_contacted_me_7_years_after_our_toxic/,t2_4y6snqs74,2023-07-29 20:03:50,25
I (25M) Felt very unhappy with my GF (23F)3 years into relationship she ask for kids and get married early.,"Long story short. My feelings are gone is that normal?

Our very first year is sweet. she is an amazing person.
Our second year is full of  mishaps early on because of her attitude towards my friends & relatives.
I lost my friends because she dint want me to hang out with them.
3rd year is where i tried to fix my self for her to see if i'm gonna be happy with her but it seems like i was not, she is also pressuring me to have kids early on. i'm not finacially stable yet.

4th year as of today. all she has for me is her love. But she is restrictive with me and that lend me to having to social life at all . i am like 40yrl old. Sad lonely and miserable. she goes out with her friends i don't really doubt her. she does not want to work any conventional job. she wants to continue the bussiness she created.

should i break up with her?
or should i just stuff down my feelings and pretend its i'am fine.

Edit:  Thanks for all the advice i really appreciate it. I decided to try again with her. i know the pain of being left by someone you become dependent with It hurts so much . the pain won't go away. i will try to save our relationship by trying to work with her. i tried to talk to her again in person she ignored me . she wants me to block this two person from my social so i did for her peace of mind. thanks guy. wish me luck and my mental health.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/131t532/i_25m_felt_very_unhappy_with_my_gf_23f3_years/,t2_v692wl53,2023-04-28 22:20:17,7

I (27F) am starting to doubt the intentions of my new (26M) LDR boyfriend - we've been together officially for only just 3 weeks. It's becoming frequent that he asks me for load and giving slight hints he wants gifts. Ayoko na maging sugar mommy uli!,"A bit of a long post TL;DR\`

&#x200B;

My boyfriend (26M) from Baguio and I (27F) from Metro Manila just started flirting with each other around June this year. Things got official when I visited him this August. Almost a month palang kami.

&#x200B;

Quick background: Pinsan siya ng fiance (38M) ng sister (31F) ko. They already have a planned trip to visit there pero di niya alam na kasama ako. I wanna see him and test the waters kung okay ba talaga siya in person.

&#x200B;

Nakapag-usap kami ng maayos and klinaro niya na malinis intentions niya with me and he's ""dating to marry"". Gusto niya exclusive na kami and tigilan na namin both mga ibang kausap namin. Pumayag ako because it's refreshing nowadays to encounter a guy na sineset kung ano talaga gusto niya. We're both not getting any younger na rin kaya okay din ako sa straight to the point na usapan.

&#x200B;

Nag stay kami sa house nila pero pag lalabas kami, lahat sagot namin. So, give and take ba. Accom sagot ng family niya, kami sa leisure/food/alcohol. Pero pag kami nalang dalawa, siya naman gumagastos. Feel ko abusado lang siya sa pinsan niya kasi mas may kaya yung family nun and mas older sa kanya.

&#x200B;

Pagkauwi ko sa Metro Manila, constant yung updates namin with each other. Phone calls, text, socmed, video calls, everything. Putol din lahat ng communication sa mga nakakausap ko, same with him daw - pinapakita pa sakin nung nagtext ex niya, di nag dadalawang isip mag share screen while on video call. Napakilala na rin niya ko sa parents niya at sa ibang friends niya. Everything seems good. I can feel the genuine assurance, commitment and loyalty.

&#x200B;

But here's the dilemma. It's kinda petty for some, so I need your insights! Baka OA lang ako. Madaming times na sinasabi niya na naubusan siya ng data, first time namin pareho ang LDR so di niya daw expect na mauubusan agad siya ng data kapag naka video call. Siya kasi nag iinitiate na naka on yung video call even while sleeping. By the way, wala sila wifi sa house kasi pinaparenovate pa house nila and lagi naman daw wala tao sa bahay, which I can attest to kasi dun kami nag stay. Pero kasi nag memention siya na pa-loadan ko siya kasi ubos na daw dun sa store na malapit sa house or kesyo nasa work pa siya etc. As for me, tbh, wala naman problem I can load his number anytime. Pero the relationship is still new. I don't want to invest in someone financially na hindi ko nakikitaan ng ibang effort aside from being loyal. Pareho naman kami may work. Baka rin ma-take advantage ako. I think it's the bare minimum to have a decent form of communication with your LDR partner. Di na nga kayo nagkikita so less gastos, so load man lang diba? Nag ddisclaimer naman siya na if wala it's okay, and tinitiis ko talaga na hindi siya pagbigyan kasi baka umabuso nga. Naka line kasi ako so di naman ako makahirit ng loadan niya ko. Pero may isang instance na bumigay ako kasi di siya sumagot talaga kahit phone call. Tulog lang naman daw siya and nagpakita naman ng proof na tinatawagan din siya ng bestfriend niya.

&#x200B;

I also just celebrated my birthday last August 23rd at a bar with friends. I updated him through and through. Di ako sanay na LDR di ko alam pano set-up pag may occasions. Kailangan ba magpadala ng gift or cake etc. It crossed my mind kasi may plan ako to surprise him on his birthday on Feb. Maybe I was expecting something from him too kasi if you're really into someone pagkakagastusan and eeffortan mo yan eh. At the same time, di pa naman kami ganun katagal for me to divulge into his financial affairs.

&#x200B;

Another thing I noticed, mahilig siya mag parinig. Nag share siya sakin once ng post about a girl na niregaluhan yung guy ng shoes. Nag sslight hints din siya na gusto niya ng side mirror. Or yung pinost ko na for sale na bag ng friend ko, early Christmas gift ko nalang daw sakanya.

&#x200B;

Ayoko naman pangunahan kasi sobrang bago pa lang namin. I just feel I'm overly cautious na kasi two of my past long-term relationships have used/abused me for money kasi masyado ako maintindihin and giver. Kuripot lang ba talaga siya dahil nakita niya naglalabas ako ng pera nung andun kami sa Baguio? Abusado ba siya kasi nakikita niya sa sa stories ko na I'm splurging? Feeling entitled ba ko kasi ayaw ko siya gastusan ng bago pa lang kami? Sawa na ko maging asukalera-de-mama hahaha. I'm trying to give him the benefit of the doubt kasi okay naman siya, but if we're dating to marry, I think he can show more of that ""provider mindset"".

&#x200B;

Need advice.

"My partner (25M) and I's (20F) relationship is counterintuitive because when we're okay, we're healthy; but toxic when we're not.","The truth is I'm not entirely sure if I should still call him my partner or if I used the right flair. My partner (M25) and me (F20) have been together for a little over 2 years now. There is no denying that he's been the healthiest relationship I've had and no one has made me feel safer and happier before. There are no traces of any kind of abuse at all. The only catch is when we're okay, we're very much okay but when we're not; he immediately asks to split. This started when we first broke up in February of this year and over the following months I desperately tried to be the backbone of the relationship and we eventually got to the point of everything settling down and almost going back to normal. I say we're counterintuitive  because we really are healthy in the best possible way when we're okay but when we're not, he's quick to want to walk away. Recently, we had an argument that could easily be fixed but immediately led to breaking up. I know a lot of you will say that I should just give it up and focus on other things yada yada yada, I get it. But you should know he is the safest place I've ever had amongst the many challenges I've faced in this age. I do not want to give up on him at all, I want us to work, but all without consuming myself in the process. 

How do I let him know I still want to us to stay and work it all out without having him feel like I've got him on chokehold? That I simply just want us to give us another shot until we master the blueprint of our relationship? 

P.S. I know about avoidant attachment style. I am the anxious one. I just need to know how to go on about this.

"My (22NB) family who I have a low contact/strained relationship with, invited me to Christmas. Everyone thinks I should go, but I don’t want to","Hi, this is my first post, so I hope it makes sense. To start off I (22NB) do not have a good relationship with my parents (M50 and F50). From the time I was a kid all the way up to 19 years old, they emotionally abused me and refused to provide mental health support when I became very depressed. They were overall, very mean to me, and were incredibly toxic to my younger siblings as well. 

I am the eldest child of 3, and my family dynamic was very much that of the scapegoat, the glass child, and the golden child. I being the scapegoat, and my younger sibling we can call Riley(19) being the glass child, and my little brother we can call Evan(16), being the only boy and therefore the golden child. 

This obviously strained my relationship with my siblings quite a bit. Things continued to be strained until I turned 19 and had a terrible fight with my parents that resulted in me moving out of their house. At the time my younger siblings were still in high school and fully reliant on my parents, So I wasn’t surprised that my younger siblings sided with my parents. So I went low contact with my parents but still tried to maintain a relationship with Riley and Evan. That was in 2020, and since then, my parents and I have had on and off communication. It was mostly just awkward talks where I would try and get them to take accountability for how they treated me in the past, but it would always end with them denying everything, or telling me I needed to let go of the past and stop punishing our family for minor mistakes they may or may not have made. 

 This is how it has been for 3 years now. That is until this past June. Riley was home from school and wanted to meet up with me. It was a few daysas after my father had tried reaching out to me via text, that I read, but did not reply to. We ended up meeting up for a talk, where predictably, they tried to guilt trip me into talking to our parents, cause me ignoring them was making the entire family sad and upset. We went back and forth for a little, until they gave me an ultimatum, either I let go of my stupid grudges and talk to my parents, or we wouldn’t have a relationship. I tried to reason with them and tell them it didn’t have to be either or, but they ultimately decided they didn’t want to talk to me anymore. This was very sad to hear, but it was their decision and I respected it. I know that they still care deeply about my parents opinion, and the way they cut me off stems from them wanting to be close with my parents, so I don’t blame them. It just hurts cause it feels like I’m being ostracized for having boundaries. 

I haven’t spoken to Riley since then, but last time I heard from my father, they apparently told the whole family I was the one who cut them off and gave them the ultimatum. And now everyone in my extended family is telling me to go and make amends with Riley and my parents. But after 3 years of trying to improve things with my family, I’m tired. I’m tired of constantly being guilt tripped and gaslit, and I’m tired of ignoring how my family treats me for the sake of keeping peace. I need to tell my parents I don’t want to go, but I know it will cause a huge uproar in my family if I don’t. Should I just suck it up and go? Or should I stand firm in my decision. I just need some unbiased advice.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/18luxe6/my_22nb_family_who_i_have_a_low_contactstrained/,t2_q92kv2j4c,2023-12-19 14:05:10,9
i (23m) and my partner (22m) have had dark points in our lives that are similar. i'd like to know if it is wrong to try to love each other now that we're both healing from our respective past?,"I (23m) and my partner (22m) have come from tragic points. We are both closeted, had decent relationships that ended in very shitty ways (death of partner (homicide) for me, eventual abuse (the guy lost his sanity) for him).

We both filled that void for a while with sex and liquor. Usual shit. I cant grieve or people would think im overreacting (again, closeted), and he couldnt get over the trauma or find help (again, closeted).

At some point, we have had treatment for those issues. Mine clandestinely and alone, his with the support of his friends who know his sexuality.

We met a while back in college. I'm taking it again and eventually the weird friendship we had grew into something weird.

I realise i may have developed feelings for him. I suspected he did too, but he admitted it first so

Idk. I want to give this a shot but knowing what i went through and what he did, it feels like im biting into something that is bound to head to disaster.

I told him i need time.

How to deal with controlling/close-minded parents?,"Throwaway account. Super haba ng kwento but I'll try my best to trim the fat.

My \[28F\] parents have always been super controlling sa lahat ng bagay - career choices, friends, and of course, relationships. They absolutely do NOT approve of my current BF \[30M\]. We've been together for a few years na pero hindi pa din siya tanggap. Magpapaalam pa lang siya manligaw, super ayaw na kaagad sa kanya. This is because he just got out of a serious relationship when he decided to pursue me so super questionable daw kung gaano ka-serious. When my BF talked to my dad and asked him to just give him a chance to prove himself, he was immediately shut down kasi hindi daw kami same ng linya ng profession. My dad wants me to take over his business someday, and how will my BF help me daw if wala siyang alam about it. (If you ask me, it's a business na kaya naman matutunan - madami naman business owner in this field na hindi talaga yun ang profession. Personally, I want nothing to do with the family business anyway.) Ideal daw kasi na partners ang mag-asawa pati sa business para if ever mawala yung love, at least may reason so stay together (like him and my mom? lol) Yung mom ko may irrational hatred lang I guess.

Para tuloy kaming teenagers na patago kung magkita or mag-date. Siguro mga first half of our relationship, nakakalabas pa naman ako ng bahay mag-isa as long as magpaalam. With the help of my friends naisasama ko pa siya sa mga out of town trips. Long story short, my BF got me pregnant, and we were super excited. Unfortunately, my parents found out through a friend of mine, and immediately binugbog ako, kinulong sa bahay for months, and was forced to terminate the pregnancy. My BF did everything he could to come here and take me (even with the help of law enforcement) but my mom would just lie and say wala ako sa bahay, and they couldn't do anything about it na. My parents made me promise to never see him again. Syempre that didn't happen cos we were serious talaga about each other pero ayoko na mabugbog or makulong sa house.

A few more months after all of that happened, they found out that my BF and I have still been in contact. We were in a semi-public place, and my mom started hurting me again. My dad was making threats na ipapaligpit na daw niya si BF. So I got up and RAN. Wala ako dalang anything talaga as in kahit bag man lang. Naki-hitch sa jeep, sa motor, nakiusap sa taxi para makarating sa house ng BF ko. Before I even got there walang tigil na pala ang pag-call sa kanya ng dad ko, saying he didn't mean the ""ipapaligpit"" threats, nakikiusap if pwede nila ako makausap kasi hindi ko dala phone ko. Or better if pwede iuwi na lang ulit ako sa kanila, then we can all talk and they'll fold na daw, bibigyan na daw si BF ng chance. I really didn't want to go back but my BF and his dad really wanted to give my parents a chance, baka naman daw nagbago na talaga cos my dad just had a nearly fatal accident. Baka daw natauhan na life is short ganyan. Ideal naman daw talaga for both sides na if ikakasal na kami ang magkaroon ng sailing family, na tanggap ng parents ko and na everyone would get along. So I gave in and let them bring me back to my parents. We all sat down and talked, naglabas ng grievances, and ayun nga, sabi ng dad ko gawin lang daw ng tama, wag na itago, pumunta sa house or mag-start sa going out with friends ganyan. So sabi ng BF ko, at least diba? Hindi na daw totally NO.

To cut the story short, it's been so long na since then, and as I expected, it was all a scam. Kulong pa din ako sa bahay (hindi na nakakalabas at all, unless with family). Kapag may event na invited ako, kung invited din si BF, hindi na lang ako papapuntahin. My mom would beg me to break up with him, if I can promise her that daw, hahayaan na niya ako lumabas labas ulit with friends, mag work... Yes, they made me stop working! Palamunin na lang ako sa house. Yung BF ko naman, he would ask kung kailan na siya pwede pumunta dito, my dad would say wag muna kasi di pa din okay sa mom ko. Super hesitant naman siya to come here kahit sinabihan na siya na wag, hindi ko din alam if that's what it would take to show na talagang pursigido siya, or it would just make my parents (specifically my mom) angrier. Iba talaga talaga takbo ng utak nila so hindi ko na alam. If it were up to me mag-ipon na lang kami ang then lalayas na lang ulit ako. But my BF doesn't want to give up all hope na matanggap siya. He thinks it's what's best for our future. Hay. What should we do?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/zfx4qj/how_to_deal_with_controllingcloseminded_parents/,t2_utfde2p2,2022-12-08 20:12:09,7
Found something while online stalking my boyfriend's ex's social media and don't know what to do about it,"TW // mentions of sexual assault, minor mentions of suicide

This was already posted in r/Advice, just need as much advice as I can get. 

I've been incredibly torn on what to do about this for a few weeks now and really need some sort of advice. 

I (21F) have been with my boyfriend (22M) for around a year. I am incredibly nosey and, though I have no fears in my relationship, occasionally stalk my boyfriend's ex's (22F) social media accounts. Recently, I found my way onto her Facebook page. I scrolled a bit and found a post from a few months ago that has me incredibly freaked out. It was a post from some months back saying that on that day one year ago, my now boyfriend had sexually assaulted her. They had broken up just a few months before but were still living together at the time. No details were given on what happened so that's basically all I know about the alleged assault.

I have always thought of myself as someone who would immediately end a relationship if my partner were accused of something like this, but I have what I think is fair reason to be suspicious of these claims. 

After a few months of bf and I being together, ex messaged and told him she wants to get back together. Throughout their relationship, she was incredibly mentally abusive and controlling, causing him to have no life outside of their relationship because she wouldn't let him. He declined to get back together and she lost her mind. This lead to months of stalking and harassment from her. For the next few months, her attempts to get him to take her back include:

• Showing up to his house multiple times unannounced until he had to threaten calling the police so she would leave. 

• Messaging his friends and family to ask them to try and convince him to take her back. 

• Multiple threats on her own life, including holding a knife to her throat when she found out he was so much as in the talking stage with me.

• Spam calling him and spam messaging him on every platform constantly, even when she got no response.

• After he finally blocked her, showing up at his job to confront him.

All of these incidents happened many months after the alleged assault. He had finally blocked her 3 months before she made the post about the assault. Taking all of this into account, I don't think it's crazy to wonder if the post was some way to get back at him for not taking her back. I don't want to jump to any conclusions, I think I'm just terrified of what he'll say when I talk to him about it. The absolute best case scenario is that he didn't do it, but if that is true, that means there is still a post out there accusing him of something so horrific. There is no good outcome in the conversation, as the worst case scenario just means he DID assault her. 

I'm not worried about how he'll feel about me finding the post (I am incredibly open with him and he knows that I stalk her accounts on occasion), I just am scared for what the outcome will be. It's so easy to say this, but I cannot imagine him assaulting someone. He has never been anywhere near pushy when it comes to sex, and I cannot fathom the possibility that he might've assaulted someone. 

Everything I detailed about the he endured throughout their relationship or the time she was stalking him I was either there for or have been shown proof of, so I have no reason to doubt that. 

I just don't know where to go from here. He's noticed me being very upset and panicked recently but I've told him I can't talk about it yet. I promised that I will bring it up though, because regardless of the truth, it isn't fair for me to not share what I know. The part of me that has been assaulted myself is mad at me for doubting her story, but the part of me that was there for her stalking/harassment and knows him well is still so skeptical of everything.

I just need some honest advice on if my logic makes sense and how to confront him with this, please. Thank you for reading. 


This is my first Reddit post and I don't know how it works yet, I am just hoping this post doesn't get too much attention so that I can make sure it isn't found by any involved parties. Just need advice from a few people please.

I [20F] gave birth last January 24 to my daughter [3W] and my Live in Partner [21M] kinwestyon yung pagiging ina ko,"

I just gave birth last January 24 to my daughter, same exact date ng birthday ko. I admit it was a gift even though my pregnancy was unexpected. I have 4th degree perineal tear and 2 weeks before nag heal kasi bumuka yung tahi ko, I admit Postpartum isn't easy, simula nung pinanganak ko yung anak ko ay binabangungot ako gabi gabi, hindi ako makakain at makaupo ng maayos or kahit makata3 man lang kasi bumuka yung tahi ko sa butas ng tiwup ko. Took 5 days bago sumara. During childbirth I almost lost my life kasi napapagod na akong umire. My LIP and I, we've been together for 3 years na. Now, I was mad with my LIP [M21] kasi nasipa nya yung dog(yes my dog and hindi niya pet since may kani kaniyang pet kami) ko in a though na aagawan ng food yung cats niya (am I petty here? Kasi animal abuse?🥲), which is di ko pa napakain yung dog ko because I was busy preparing my daughter after ligo, since mixfeed naman yung baby namin, gusto ko sanang mag liwaliw for a while kahit lakad2 lang dito samin or sa malapit na mall dito na ako lang mag isa, my daughter was crying cause she's hungry and I told him na timplahan mo muna ng gatas kasi maliligo pa ako. He told me na ""kanina kopa binibigay si **** sayo pero hindi mo pinapansin, uunahin mo pa yung aso mo kesa sa anak mo, anong klase kang ina?"" That words hurt me a lot. Like super, kasi lahat ng traumas ko during pregnancy pumasok sa utak ko. Mangiyak ngiyak akong sinabi na ""Don't ask me kung anong klase akong ina, naghirap ako lahat lahat, gusto kong maligo at magpalamig pagkatapos ng ginawa mo sa aso ko, hindi ka kayang kagatin or kalmutin ng aso ko alam mo yan, pagalit na salita mo tumatakbo na yan, tapos sisipain mo bigla kasi dahil aagawan lang ng pagkain ang pusa mo? Anong klase kang ama? Yan din ba ituturo mo sa anak mo? Mas mabuti pang umuwi kami kesa na lumaki siya na nakikita nyang bayolente yung ama niya"" it's not verbatim. Yung away namin yung napakasakit kasi I did my best to be a great mom no matter what, I almost lost my daughter dahil sa pamilya niya(muntikan na kong makunan but luckily kumapit ng mabuti si baby ka). I need your advices lang din sa mga naka experience ng postpartum, did I really do my best or kulang pa? I'm a first time mom and I know madami pa akong kelangan matutunan. I want to know your opinion on how to be a better mom.

I (27F) was left by my husband (27M). I’m tired of trying to fix things with him because it’s not working but we have a toddler and another one on the way.,"Hi, so I’ve been trying to wrap my head around this “challenge”, if you can even call it that, for the past month. My husband (27M) and I(27F) had a little altercation causing him to go back to his parents. We’ve been together for 5 years, married for 3.

For context, we live in my mother’s house(67F) in Negros Occidental because he did not want to purchase a property together when I told him that I wanted us to find our own place. 

So back to the altercation, I asked him to help around the house since my mom is not the typical house wife type, sa bahay niya if you want to eat, you cook your food, you do your chores, this has been the set up even when my siblings and I were still growing up. You can say that we live in an “ingredient household” with her. I don’t mind doing chores, and the cooking but he has a bad habit of being lazy. He mostly stays in our room playing ML while our toddler plays outside with his toys, I wash the milk bottle downstairs, and cook and when I’m done, I’d have to call him downstairs to eat and I will still have to ask him to wash the dishes after. This is what has been happening because he says he’s not comfortable, that’s why he’s not helping or talking to my family members na pumupunta sa bahay. So, I got fed up being his Yaya and told him that if he didn’t want to help, he should go back to his mom (53F) who does everything for him, and to no surprise, he did. Now he lives with his parents in a small municipality in Negros Oriental and I’m left 3 months pregnant and still having to tend to our toddler (3M). 

His justification for leaving me in this state is “magtatayo daw siya ng bahay sa lupa ng parents niya” because it’s for free, the land he is referring to is his parents’ compound and is 5 minutes away from his parents house but they both stay in the compound most of days, and I don’t want to live with my in-laws or my Mom either. I asked him to meet me halfway but he’s insistent on not budging kasi ayaw daw niya mag bayad monthly for a house kasi his job is unstable. We’re both professionals but chose to work as freelancers. He keeps saying he’s just thinking about the future, and when I told him that I may miscarry our unborn child, and my doctor told me to be on bed rest for 2 weeks, he just told me “mag bed rest ka, ano magagawa ko wala naman ako diyan” but it’s not so hard for him to pack up and leave us pero ganon ka hirap for him to come back. I earn around 40k monthly, he earns five times as much as I do kasi he’s a direct hire and he has two clients but barely gives any support kahit sa mga bata man lang. Economically abused din kami at this point because he doesn’t want to provide when things aren’t going his way.
I’ve been really stressed out and frustrated because of his decisions, he keeps blaming me for everything kasi daw it was my decision not to go with him when he didn’t even talk to me about any of it and just went on his way. He’s terrible at communicating and just thinks that whatever he decides on is what’s best for us and I have no say or whatsoever. His parents are not even worried why he’s there with them and not with us. 

I just don’t know what to do at this point kasi sobrang napapagod na ako, everything I tell him falls into deaf ears and at this point I just want to leave him so that I can have peace. 

I mean, I can afford to sustain one child, but two is quite difficult. I’ve been trying to look for opportunities din other than my current job kasi if hindi talaga siya mag bibigay, I will have to do all this on my own.

Will leaving him be the right choice? 
What else can I do to make sure na he gives what is due to the children?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/153vham/i_27f_was_left_by_my_husband_27m_im_tired_of/,t2_svxb1qcn,2023-07-19 21:44:49,8
I... (32F) and my boyfriend (24M) keeps discussing about going out with his friends including girls.," Medyo mahaba I hope you read and give me some advice cause it's my first time to be in a relationship with someone whose younger than me. Help me or give me some advice how to handle it.

Me and my boyfriend is in relationship for 5 months now. He's a guy who have a lot of friends and can make friends wherever he goes. And have a lot of girl na friends. At first I let him go out with his friends cause I really trust him. Pero when I can see that everytime he's being not consistent sa time na napag usapan and one time I saw him that he can't handle himself when he gets drank. I overthink. Hindi ko maiwasan eh. I've been in abusive 6years relationship before. 

 He gave me this words before na ""kahit gaano pa ako kalasing never ako lalapit sa babae"" pero naging kabaligtaran sa nakita ko. Harap harapan ko siyang nakita na sumama sa babae to dance. And I got really upset and left in shocked. Tapos nung pauwi na kame infront of me nag hoholding hands pa sila. Nasa harap lang talaga ako. I confronted him and he said ""lasing lang siya and he doesn't know he did that"" Dito na nag umpisa yung ayoko na siya lumalabas without me. 

 I get it that he's younger than me and talagang puro barkada pa. But he really wanna make this relationship work, ayaw niya akong mawala. Sabi niya gusto niya lang sulitin. I get his point. Pero sana man lang he knows how to manage his time. Kase whenever magkasama kame he's always asleep. Pero kapag lalabas kasama friends niya he can stay awake 24/7 isn't that unfair to me? Ayaw ko siya umaalis pero maya't maya yung invitations ng mga friends niya. I don't wanna lock him up agad agad kase I understand he's young and need it. Pero what if mag cheat siya, di nanaman niya ma control kapag nakainom siya? Sumosobra ba ako?

 He'll go out with his friends today and I know marame nanaman babae. And I can't come kase sobrang lala ng cramps ko. And without hesitations or second thoughts he said yes. Kase birthday daw yun ng pinaka close niya. For sure uuwi na siya umaga nanaman. Kahit sabihan ko kase siya ng time it will end up saying na ""ayaw kase nila ako paalisin"" minsan lang naman"" (even though ako na nag aadjust cause every week lumalabas kame ng barkada niya para wala sila masabi) tas aalis nanaman siya ng Wednesday birthday ng isa nanaman niyang barkada tapos kasama yung babaeng lumandi sakanya. And still he wants to go even without me. I don't know anymore.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/14baiqo/i_32f_and_my_boyfriend_24m_keeps_discussing_about/,t2_g0mtwkdw,2023-06-17 06:58:35,4
I (22M) love my gf (20F) but can't handle her ego. Her lack of communication skills is ruining our relationship,"Hi, me and my girlfriend have been in a relationship for about 6 months. We love each other a lot and I still care for her. Eventhough we are from two communities, her being a Hindu and me being a muslim we worked around that and still had a loving relationship.

However, my gf has the issue of prolonging issues and not communicating her problems to me. There are stages to the problem:
1. She acts differently and snarky.
2. I realise that she has an issue with something I did or said.
3. I have to guess what that thing is correctly.
4. I have to apologise for it.
5. Then all is well until another issue comes along

I feel tired of this and its mentally draining, it happened around 7 times. Each time I have to play this game, where she acts snarky for few days until I get it right. For example one time it was because we didnt spend emough time together this took 2 days to resolve when it could have resolved with simple communication. Another time i forgot our 4th anniversary and she was pissed at me for a few days. The most recent episode of this happened on Saturday she acted out i just texted her when she is ready to talk to text me. 

It's been like 5 days and no reply she read it. She expects me to text her and guess why she is angry and say sorry for some random thing that could have easily been resolved. We missed our valentines day plan of me taking her out for dinner. I assumed it was cancelled becuase she was ghosting me for the 4 days before valentines. This also happened during Christmas and had the bo talking periods. But then I had to be the mature one and text her and sort out the issue.

Sorry this is coming out like a rant, I am not even sure where I am leading this. But its just I love her a lot and she loves me a lot too. She is from an abusive household, and I want go care for her. Also she has said in the past she has a massive ego and yes I felt it a lot sometimes. I think now the cold War of not texting is due to her ego, I know she wants to text me, she is probably angry that I didn't text her on valentines and her bday is coming up next week too. It's just I explained to her the issue about her lack of communication skills when she doesn't like something 6 times, I want her to be mature and text me and not go on this ego trip of not texting me. Before I was sure I wasn't gonna text her, but I really miss her and love her, I don't know what to do. What should I do. I asked my friends they say the guy usually has to do what the girl says and give up our egos. I want her to grow as a person  and not he petty. Should I try and give advice to her again like the previous times and sort her issue out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/1ars4vk/i_22m_love_my_gf_20f_but_cant_handle_her_ego_her/,t2_u9v1dazpm,2024-02-16 06:24:06,1
"They say ignorance is bliss, pero pano ko hindi papansinin if may ex (F23) na epal ang bf (M20) ko (F21)","
context: they were together for 5 yrs— grounds of breakup was abuse and a ton of toxicity. broken up more than half a yr when my bf and I met. bf and i have been officially dating for 4 months, but known each other for almost 9 months. still no formal inteoduction to his fam, pero aware sila saken.  the ex still wants him, and i’m relapsing all over again. 

Akala ko talaga I was over it. Sobrang papansin lang kasi talaga nung ex eh. Nung last week of aug, nag celebrate ng bday  yung mama ng ex ko and the ex was part of the program. I attended the celebration as a guest, kasama ko yung bestfriend ng bf ko and bestfriend ko din. I observed kung paano sya ininclude sa table w immediate family. I saw din kung gaano ka close sya sa older sister ng bf ko.

The ex saw me. Nasa harap sya nung venue place, but kami sa may likod kami pumwesto and lumapit agad samin yung bf ko nung nakita niya kami. 

Towards the end of the night, the ex herself introduced me sa sister in law ng bf ko bilang girlfriend. Nagulat ako, pero I did my best to be polite nadin. 

An hours later, the ex reached out to me via socmed to explain her reasons on why she’s still involved sa family gatherings.Andami nyang sinabe, pero eto yung mga keypoints: 

“Gusto ko rin sana na ipakilala ka na para maka exit na talaga ako”

“Alam ko naman na lugar ko kaya ako na mismo nagpapakilala sayo. Sadyang super close ako sa fam nya.”

“Gusto ko din i-respect yung rs niyo kasi yun yung dapat” 

“Nageexplain ako dahil ayokong isipin mo na pinipilit ko pa sarili ko dito or ginagamit ko yung fam ni *bf ko* para mapalapit sa kanya kasi matagal naman na kami wala and tanggap ko na”

“I’m sorry sa mga nangyayari, pero thank you padin sa pag intindi. If ako nasa sitwasyon mo, hindi rin talaga madali. Ayoko lang ng may nasasaktan”

“I will make sure na gagawa din ako ng paraan para unti unti akong makaalis kasi ang hirap din sakin” 

Then 1 week later, inaya sya ng fam ng bf ko na sumabay sa byahe kasi dun sila pumunta sa place near where the ex works. Sumama sya. Yung bf ko and kuya nya, nasa bday but yung ex is nasa mall w his mom and older sister. 

3 weeks later, the ex posts on ig. 3 pictures pinost nya and lahat yun is from the bday of my bf’s mama. The last pic is a family pic na kasama sya tas nakatakip yung mukha ng bf ko w an emoji. If a few days after nya pinost, I’d be fine. Pero 3 weeks after nung bday tas may pa takip pa ng mukha? lol 

San banda dyan yung “respecting my rs” and yung will nya to make a way to fully exit? i smell bs lmao

My bf and I talked long and hard about this. Sobrang sama ng loob ko about dun sa bday na yun, pero pinili ko padin talaga intindihin dahil hindi rin madali sa bf ko yung sitwasyon and I don’t want to pressure him in any way at all. 

The reason why I’m relapsing is bc my bf invited me to his sister’s bday next month, kaso I’m 99% sure na invited din yung ex.  

My emotions are all over the place about this. I’m secure in my position bilang girlfriend, pero ang awkward kasi non if same place kami lol It’s almost as if merong isa samin na ayaw makiramdam hahahaha 

I badly need advice. I’m confused if napapanoverthink lang ako or valid naman?

p.s antigas ng mukha nya talaga sa part na pinost nya pa yung pics sa ig. madaming pic naman yon na hindi kasama bf ko, pero ininclude nya pa talaga yung kasama sya tas tinakpan ng emoji. her friends were going at it sa comments.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/16my6lt/they_say_ignorance_is_bliss_pero_pano_ko_hindi/,t2_bkv1wwn5,2023-09-20 02:15:21,20
"I (20m) am on a three years relationship with a depressive (18f) girlfriend, still loving her but feeling stuck in the relationship, considering breaking up with her but fear for her mental health","TL;DR no common hobbies, lots of energy spent and dead bedroom with a depressive girlfriend. Still loving her but feeling stuck in the relationship, considering breaking up with her but fear of degrading her mental health.

So it's been three years we are together and she was always depressive. She self-harms, has a really bad body image. She is never happy, cries a lot and weekly talks about commiting suicide. She says she's constantly imaging herself in bad situations. She has no hobby (except dance), her parents were toxic, verbally abusive for most of her childhood and her mom died from cancer that lasted four years of trauma for my gf. She's been seeing a psychiatrist for a year and saw psychologists before that, she takes antidepressants for a few months then stop taking them for a few months and restarts after. She says it's ineffective and that nobody will ever understand her. She's sick of fighting daily to stay in a life she doesn't want to live.

She has anger issues and was constantly mean with me for half a year, I had to threaten a break up in order for her to stop mistreating me. Now she isn't mean, however she regularly says she has no sexual attraction to me, which hurts my feelings. The antidepressants make it worse but even when she's not taking them she has no sexual desire for me. Maybe once a month she's in the mood, but if i'm not ready to have sex quickly she will loose the mood and feel worse as before. It's stressful for me and most of the time sex leaves us unsatisfied. It's not only about sex, kisses and hugs are quite rare.

We don't have many common hobbies and most of the time spent together is laying on bed. When she's not at school, she stays laying in bed, watching tiktok for hours. She doesn't want any child when we'll grow old, while I sure want some. However she says that it's entirely caused by her depression and that if she's cured someday, she'll probably have more hobbies and be more interested in doing activities during the day, be more kind to people and maybe reconsider having children. We are often arguing too.

Since her dad is toxic, he's not talking to the rest of the family and her mom is dead so the only two left are her and her dad. But he's not intelligent and is uninterested in her, so I'm the only one she talks to about her dance courses or her study choices, exams, clothes, etc. She says I'm the only reason she's still alive. However our relationship is stressful and, even if she says she loves me and she's constantly doing huge efforts to be with me, I still thing the relationship takes too much energy from me. The problem is that I really love her, and I don't want her dying because of me, I don't want to leave her at all. But I'm young and I hadn't the chance to fully discover me, I have a dead bedroom and I don't know if she's the one, we don't have long and deep conversations like I have with some of my friends. I love her and she's not considering anyone other than me, but I feel like I'm stuck. Is breaking with her a good idea ?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/179jw82/i_20m_am_on_a_three_years_relationship_with_a/,t2_jzyj2wiml,2023-10-17 07:20:15,1
I [21F] am going through a distressing time with my current partner [20F] of our current status in our almost 3-year relationship. The 3-year itch is a real thing.,"We talked about this last chance but it's really solely on me, my other half gave me the ultimatum. Our relationship isn't perfect just like everybody else. The recent issue was due to miscommunication that led to where my partner and I are now. 

We had a fight, my partner made fun of me for getting a zero in a certain course and I took offense on that one knowing we had a past issue about micro-cheating and I felt like at that exact moment I was being cheated again because my other half chooses to acknowledge and praised someone else achievement over mine. 

I was really mad at that time, I vent out some of what I felt on my dummy account, and I was really pissed off about this one block mate of mine that keeps bragging shit to me, and I posted about that, but my other half thought that specific post was meant for them, but I was pertaining to my block mate who's gotten really into my nerves. I miscommunicated that, I was too late to explain everything because my partner already absorbed what I said. 

We were mad at each other, profanity and everything. I tried explaining things and I wanted to mend it. We both had our wrongdoings, but I had it worse. When I became persistent in making it right with this last shot. I said just give me this last chance and I will leave you be without question or explanation; I will respect that if I mess things up again. My other half perceived my move as me being controlling, manipulative, creepy, and obsessive. That's why I think I fucked up big time around this time.

 In addition to that, there were unexpected events that made our situation worse than it is now. Now, my partner's family knows our relationship and my other half received physical violence and verbal abuse from them because of us being together. My other half is not accepted for who they are. 

We had an agreement about this last chance and If I mess things up again which leads to making my other half feel that unpleasant feelings again, doesn't matter if it's only one mistake then it's over. Right now, we're trying to rebuild everything, we will start with civil interaction and slowly progress back to being casual and back to romantic interactions, but we still have that label until my other half is comfortable again around me. T

his will take time because I don't think my partner trusts me enough that I can make things right and better this time around. I'm having a hard time on what things I should consider; everything feels uncertain even though my other half gave me assurance that they will try to compromise not fully for now but little by little and slowly until we get back. I have to make double efforts in this one. Is it really possible to rebuild a relationship from scratch? **What things can a person do to be able to regain someone's feeling of security and comfort around them as well as how to work this out without losing yourself in the long run?**",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/173nnf3/i_21f_am_going_through_a_distressing_time_with_my/,t2_4d73zrqy2,2023-10-09 17:33:13,1
I (27F) can't break up with my bf (31M) but I need to soon before we move in together this coming weekend,"God I am so ashamed to be writing this. Throwaway account because he follows my main... Also warning I talk about sex in this a bit...

I (27F) am having a really hard time breaking up with my (31M) boyfriend. We've been together about 6 months. I'll try to be detailed but not write a novel.

We met about 9 months ago in a education setting (being a little discrete here lmao or else it'd be kind obvious to everyone we know). It was a virtual setting and we just hit it off instantly. Immediately, diehard best friends. He fell in love with me and I fell in love with him in a matter of like 8 weeks. I was VERY FRESHLY coming out of a 6 year marriage and I was very emotional and hurt from that. But he was so kind and comforting. I felt like from him I was getting love, reassurance, and support that I've never gotten from anyone before. We planned on meeting in person for the first time after about the 9-10 week mark.

I was so nervous to meet him and I'm very very weird about sex, I told him a few times that I didn't want to have sex the first time we met in person. I had only every had sex with my ex before and I had had some not so good experiences that made me want to wait. He assured me I'd feel comfortable enough with him that I wouldn't have those concerns. When I pressed him by what that meant he was always pretty vague.

That combined with the fact that I was so raw from coming out of a relationship so recently, put me in a mindset of telling him I was too nervous to come visit him yet. I told him I was so sorry but I just needed a little more time to heal from my past relationship and work things out in my head before we get serious (he was already talking marriage and such at this point). I know it was shitty of me to cancel the same day. I felt horrible about it.

That was the first time I saw him lose his shit. He told me that I was fake, that I never really loved him, that I was just playing him and wanted to get back with my ex and that was why I wouldn't go to see him. He threatened me with dropping out of our education course because he was so hurt and couldn't handle seeing me everyday. I told him I wasn't breaking up with him (we had just started dating a few days prior officially) but just that I needed us to slow things down. He accused me of leading him on, which I kept getting confused about because I wasn't breaking up with him.

So I apologized and said I would come anyway, but I told him again I didn't want to have sex and to please be slow with me because I felt really fragile. He reassured me and stayed on the phone with me the whole drive over. He initiated sex with me and I didn't say no. I didn't say yes (I mean he didn't ask) but I didn't say no, so I don't count it as assault or anything. But my god that hurt my feelings so much. He assured me he'd go slow, but it happened in the first 10 minutes of meeting.

That was my confirmation that he didn't really respect me, even though to this day he tells me all the time he does.

After that his behavior totally changed. No more outpouring of sweet words or actions. He got mad all of the time. He still does. He yells at me about my tone constantly. That I have a bitchy tone, but really it's if I have anything but my very happy tone he gets upset.

The fights were usually in that vein or him telling me I'm cheating because I didn't answer a phone call fast enough (that was really only 3 times though).  I cried all of the time and he told me I was just too emotional and needed to learn that fighting in relationships is healthy if no one is physically hurt. Or if there was no verbal abuse and then would grill me ""You don't think I'm verbally abusing you, right?"" and if I didn't give a resounding no he'd lecture me about how I'm too soft.

I totally lost all of my spark. He started telling me it was time to move in together. Really I let myself be convinced that moving in together would fix all of our problems. He got really sweet when he'd tell me he'd love to cook me breakfast everyday and go on walks. Begin our lives together. I got really scared. I kept saying yes but raising concerns. Saying I wanted to weight until we fought less or we were employed in the field we were studying to be in. He would tell me there wasn't a reason to weight.

I was a total pushover and it wasn't fair of me to give in and say yes when I wanted to say no. It was deceitful of me. Eventually it was a week before we planned to move in together and I broke down and told him I couldn't do it. I wasn't ready, I didn't want to break up, but I couldn't live with him yet. I needed more stability in my life and in our relationship.

He was really upset, which to a degree that's fair, it was such short notice. But, he told me that I was fucking with his life by quitting like this. That I was fake and I never really loved him. That people who loved each other wouldn't act like this. That I was so immature for thinking this was. He told me I had to choose right then to either live together or to break up. I told him I didn't want either of those things and he said before he hung up ""Great, well I'm telling everyone you broke us up"".

He messaged all of our friends that I was a liar and a cheater in a group chat with me in it. He then called like 10 minutes later, we argued for a bit and then he reeled me in telling me it would be fine. Nothing I'm concerned about is going to be an issue. He was so comforting. Promising me things would be so much better when we lived together. That we just fought because we were frustrated being away from each other.

I calmed down and agreed that we would move in together the next week. God sorry this is long. Anyway I broke up with him the day before we were supposed to move in together the second time over text (it's shitty and cowardly, I know. I just couldn't say the words, but that's no excuse) and I blocked him on everything. That's shitty to, I know I know but I knew that if he called me I would cave and get back with him. I was so unhappy.

I started getting dozens of calls from an unknown number. I knew it was him. He texted me several times from that number telling me I was fake and how could I do this to someone I loved. Simple, because I didn't love him (his words). It broke my heart over and over. I blocked that number too and turned off my phone for 5 days.

He made a fake linkedin account and got me there. I caved. I read the message and replied. He told me we needed to have an adult conversation about what happened. That it wasn't right to end like this. I thought I owed him that, an explanation. Long story short we got back together and I apologized for how I ended things. He told me he accepts me and my mental health issues that make me like this (even though they don't I don't think, he just says that a lot).

We've been back together like this since early February of this year. So many more fights about my tone and attitude. I'm always crying. I'm always apologizing. But god I love him. I really poured my whole soul into this man. It kills me that I'll never hear his voice, his laugh, ever again. I'm crying just at the thought. It hurts.

God writing it out makes it seem obvious that we need to break up. But sometimes, he's just so sweet and kind that I think this is really all my fault. That I'm just so broken and insecure that I've really caused all of these issues. But regardless of if it's my fault or not, I need out.

We're supposed to move in together this weekend. See my pattern? Bailing at the last minute. I'm shit, I know trust me. Please give me advice. How can I break it off for real this time. Please give me advice that's beyond just do it. I can't be the only one who gets pulled in so easily. I'm a pushover. I'm anxious. Please help. I'm posting this a few places because of the deadline. Be honest if you want. I have a lot to criticize. I know my flaws.

TL:DR: Uhh I'm a coward who keeps trying to get out of a relationship that I think is toxic and my boyfriend keeps convincing me not to and I keep giving in. (Sorry idk how to make this short)

"My mom [F40] yelled at me today for ""overreacting"" because I [F22] was worried about my pet rabbit being left in a car. Yet she also overreacts about her pet dogs. I can't bring myself to forgive her.","I would like advice on how to forgive my emotionally immature, hypocritical and unreasonable mom. 

Earlier today, my mom yelled at me in a restaurant because I was worried that my pet rabbit was left alone in a car with no air conditioning. When I went to get my bunny (a girl), my mom said she was going to be fine, but I insisted that my pet could suffocate inside of the car. She became hysterical at this and yelled she would not suffocate. She told me not to overreact but also proceeded to say ""If your pet suffocates then kill me.""

When we got to our rest house (we're on a staycation of sorts), I heard her screaming our pet dog's name (let's call him Apple) who happened to be nearby a larger dog (Peanut). Peanut wasn't even doing anything, he didn't even look aggressive and my mom was screaming as if Apple was about to die. Hearing her scream like that really pissed me off when Apple was in no way going to get hurt, but when I got understandably worried over my rabbit who was definitely at risk being left inside of a car, she got hysterical at me for ""overreacting"". 

This issue basically killed my mood for the rest of the day. I'm still mad and what's worse is that I can't even show my anger because my mom will just see it as me being a brat. 

Like many Asian parents, my mom is not someone who apologizes and rarely ever goes out of her way to understand other people's perspectives. Therefore a healthy conversation with her/expecting an apology from her is out of the table. 

The only for me to move forward is to really forgive her, but I don't know how. I would really appreciate some advice or maybe insights from anyone in a similar situation! 

Extra info about my mom (that might help you guys understand what she's like): 

- Her love language is giving gifts. She's actually quite a chill mom, she always gets me takeout, lets me sleep in late and buys me lots of stuff. I know I'm a spoiled child but that doesn't mean I can abandon the safety of my pet! While she was yelling at me she said that I was ""too privileged"" and me worrying over the safety of my pet was some kind of abuse over her generosity. 

- My mom got me the rabbit as a gift. It was an impulsive purchase and she had no idea how to take care of the bunny. I did all of the research and learned how to care for the bunny. I noticed whenever I have to ask her to do something inconvenient in any way for the sake of my rabbit's safety/wellbeing, she gets really mad. But when it's concerning our dogs it's fine with her.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/145bwzq/my_mom_f40_yelled_at_me_today_for_overreacting/,t2_19pox8rr,2023-06-10 01:50:27,1
I (F21) am struggling with my fiancé's past (M21). I am thinking of calling of our wedding because I can't imagine having sex with him because of his past.,"My fiancé and I have been together for 9 months, and engaged since December. We met through a dating app, and immediately hit it off. We are both Christian's, faith based, and I made my decision to marry him based off of what my spiritual gut was telling me. So many things fell into place that make him the perfect match for me, and I for him as well. He treats me like I am his whole world, and tells me so, on a regular basis. I have been very happy with him, up until his ex girlfriend popped up in a DM, showing me pictures of her, and the two of them together. I grew up following the bible and the word, as did he. We are given certain guidelines to follow in order to have the most glorifying life in God's eyes (there's a point to this, I promise I'm not witnessing) and I have followed those rules all my life. He chose to rebel as a teenager, I did not. My problem lies in that, I have always known he has had sexual partners before me. He was very upfront about it on our 2nd date, and It wasn't something I was pleased to hear, but I did not judge him, as it is not my place to do so. However, fast forward to December 2023, and I struggling to face the fact that he has had relations with two other women before me. It grosses me out, and it became something I obsessed over. I am fully aware this is a PERSONAL PROBLEM OF MINE, and that I am most likely experiencing retroactive jealously. I do have low self esteem and have been working on my self confidence for a bit. This just seemed to crumble me further. I am seeing a therapist started this week, but wanted to see if someone could put this into perspective from maybe my fiancé's point of view? maybe it wouldn't hurt me as much, if i could really see how much the truth of the matter affects him too.  
  
I have had a few deep long conversations with him about it, as he has made me be totally transparent and honest with him about my struggles mentally, because he views our problems individually, as a couple issue instead. We've worked on his insecurities in the past, and I didn't feel uncomfortable sharing with him my thoughts. I did express to him I did not think my thoughts were acceptable or healthy, but that I cannot move past them. He explained to me mostly what happened and how.  
  
He was 16 and 17 when he had sex with his current girlfriends (a year and half apart each), and expressed to me how the first girlfriend was borderline abusive, and that he felt peer-pressured into having sex, as she wanted to do it, and everyone in his school was talking about it. I can't fathom this pressure, because I was homeschooled. I am able to understand that easier than the second relationship. The second relationship lasted much longer. They dated for 4 years, and had sex a year into it. He told me it wasn't his idea, and that he felt close to her only when they had sex. They had sex a few times, and stopped. I'm not sure if it was all because the sex wasn't good, maybe no connection or they were bad at it, or because she actually was talking to another guy behind his back. For four years he dated this girl, who he expressed to me, didn't show any real interest in him, and never put him as a priority. He did not love her, he expressed, and felt like he probably had sex with her as a way to rebel, but also to make feel a connection to her. Hearing this, I still feel disgusted. I hate that, because my heart tells me I shouldn't think that way about something I deeply care about. However, the idea that he's been intimate with two others before me, and it wasn't even a positive experience, grosses me out. He feels grossed out as well, and is sorry that he did not uphold morals that he was raised with. Once again, I DO NOT THINK I AM BETTER THAN HIM, but my brain keeps tricking me into thinking things that are not true, and I am hyper fixated on the sex. How would you feel if you were him? and how should I approach these thoughts and feelings, so that I may find a healthy way to process it and get tf over it?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/1aurdcb/i_f21_am_struggling_with_my_fiancés_past_m21_i_am/,t2_tnja57iui,2024-02-20 00:25:28,2
"My boyfriend (18M ) is an ex porn addict, but really trying to improve himself, should I support him ?","

Hi everyone, i'm posting here cause I'm feeling like I'm being overdramatic about this situation and i clearly need a lot of differents pov

My boyfriend ( 18M ) and me ( 16F ) have been knowing each other for 6 years. I met him on internet and quickly fell in love with him. He wasn't interested by me at all, and it brokes my heart at the moment.
I knew something was off with him. Because he kept talking to my girls friends in a very sexual way. He even proposed to have sex with my girl bestfriend ( I was 13 and they were both 15.) 
He always kinda joked about it, what he liked during sex, fetisch and stuff like that. He's into really hard bdsm, and didn't hide it at all.

So I always knew sex was really important to him.
When we saw each other for the first time, I was 14 and he was 16. We had a really big intimacy, like sleeping in the same bed and he was touching me and stuff. (I was consent tbh!)
Anyway I really liked this closure since I was in love with him for 3 years now, but after that i was madly confused about our relationship. Are bestfriends supposed to act like that with each other? Before leaving my house, he grants me with a choker, saying it was my birthday gift to mark my submission to him. 
And after that we developed a BDSM-like relationship.

It was really intense for me, I wasn't used to things like that at all, but I loved him so much that I didn't manifest any form of disapproval. 
He started asking me for picks, which I was really inconfortable with but tried my best to give him what he wanted. And it felt great.
He still refused to call me his girlfriend even if we had a really close intimacy and sexual convo, he called us ""friends with benefits.""
I think he has commitment issues do to his traumas.
Anyway, that sucks.

But last October, out of nowhere, he proposed me to be his girlfriend ! I was so happy because I waited for this moment during years.
He was a very good boyfriend. Always here for me, always offering me gifts, spending time together, introduce to his family, we even celebrate Christmas together. It was really amazing, I come from a broken home and he and his family were so caring with me, it felt really nice.
Sexually it was kinda hard to me because I have been abused, and he was really understanding but when I agreed to have sexual closure with him, he asked me to do really hard things and immediately went into bdsm, even if I were only 15 at the moment.

Everything was going pretty good, but after all he did to me in the past, I was suspicious about his fidelity. So I looked up at his following.
 Hear me out, he followed ONLY naked girls, hentai content accounts, cosplayer... more than 300 accounts.
 I was shocked. Really. It hurted me so much to see that. He immediately erased all of this when I talked to him about it.
But i was still really hurt.
So I create a fake account in February.
And came to talk to him with it.
At first he didn't talk much with my fake account named Camille, he didn't even add her at first, so I was pretty confident, saying to myself I was paranoid and he would never do that to me.
 He was really cold with her since he didn't know her and is cold with everyone usually. But after a week, they start getting closer, and fast they agree that she'll be her submissive and have a sexual and emotional relationship because ""My girlfriend is too vanilla for me and can't satisfy my sexual needs"" pretending to her I will be agree ( he didn't hide the fact that he had a girlfriend).

Me reading that, I was devastated. I know it's bad to create a fake account, but I needed answers since it's the guy I want to spend my life with.
Even if I knew I wasn't perfect I tried my best to satisfy him, and his super high standards, always wearing new lingerie, always being INTEGRALY shaved..
I cried for hours not knowing what to do, and when I came to his house, took his phone, he had deleted the convo before my arrival. I confronted him, saying Camille told me everything. 
He started apologizing, saying that he loved me really and he tried to stop himself, but he think with his dick sometimes and blablabla...
I cried in his bed out of anger.
But I couldn't really blame him since I created this account to match his tastes perfectly and was REALLY provocative in my messages.
My therapist told me I trapped him into something that no man could resist...
So I started relativise and forgive him, saying to myself that after all he cheated me with myself and that will be a lesson for him not doing it again.


The relationship was still going, but very recently, after he promised to stop, I found on his tiktok following a naked girl, again.
And in his insta likes, a naked girl, he likes the post a few weeks ago.

I need to say that, he confessed to me a few weeks that he was severely addict to porn. I had doubts on it but it's the first time he openly talked about it with me. So I listened. He told me that, the day I showed him his followings and how disgusting it was, he had the revelation that it has gotten too far and that he wanted to stop for me and our relationship. He said he hasn't watched porn in months and that he was clean. I believed him, but after what I found, I don't know anymore.
All this shit hurted me so bad, he's the most precious boy ever and I love him so much but what he did... it broke me, literally. I don't feel the same since I found that about him.
I feel so empty.

But I know he made a tons of efforts, except that, he's genuinely a really loving, and caring person and that he went through a lot when he was younger, which affects his perception of things and he deals with it unhealthy. I dont want to abandon him, i want to help him since he already made good progress and I know he really want our relationship to last, but should I forgive me and be compassionate about the situation? Or should I give up ?

"Hi, people who have not receive the closure they deserve… how did you move on? Esp when he has someone new that quick...","Hello. My ex (M33) broke up with me (F25) via messenger chat last January. We had a fight and hindi kami nagkaintindihan… to cut the story short it was just another ‘petty fight’.  
We were together for 2 years. I was the avoidant type, and I don’t wanna hear abusive words from him pag naga-away kasi puro nalang pagmumura and lait sinasabi niya kahit alam kong heat of the moment lang. So, I went home bc I had nowhere to go to. I wanted him to approach me first sana, kasi lahat ng recent away namin ako lang ang di makatiis lagi. After 2 days, nagpunta ako sa kanila para makausap na siya kasi di ko na talaga kaya, pero mainit pa rin ulo niya so nagdecide ako na umuwi nalang ulit. I was so sick of the words he has told me, pagmumura and all. It lasted for another 2 weeks, I was overthinking na talaga kasi hindi umaabot ng 1-week ung di namin pagpapansinan usually. But this time, 2 weeks and counting. When I messaged him hi, don na siya nagreply na ayaw niya na. He was pagod na raw to understand my mood and shits. He broke up with me via chat LANG.  
I believe he is not that type of guy so I still hold on to him. He did not unfriend me and erased all of his IG posts with me. Pero isang buwan na after nung nangyari and nababaliw na ako. I tried to contact him, left him a long message pero wala siyang reply, he blocked me then (pero late niya na nadelete ung IG posts niya). That’s when I decided na puntahan na siya sa bahay ulit and texted him na I need to find answers kasi for me it was really biglaan. We were happy naman talaga pero that fight lang nag-give up na siya. Hindi niya manlang pinaramdam sakin na napapagod na siya. Ang dami kong tanong sa sarili. Kaya tinext ko siya ng mga tanong ko, and added ‘May iba na ba?’ kahit alam kong sa sarili ko never niya magagawa sakin yun. He replied na he doesn’t want to see and talk to me anymore, wala raw siyang ibang babae, wag na raw ako mag-overthink. I accepted na, kasi medyo nakuntento ako sa sinabi nyang wala siyang iba.  
This time… I had a feeling lang bigla. I tried to stalk him, found out he has a new girl. Masakit, pero curiosity kills nga talaga. I found out that they have been talking a week after nung last text niya sakin saying wala siyang iba! And magfofocus daw siya sa sariili niya! I can’t confirm kelan sila nagkamabutihan kasi lahat ng friends and family niya di ako pinapansin since then. My friends said baka naguusap na sila during our relationship… I’m so fucked up bc if it’s true, bakit di ko napansin? ☹  
I am still in pain… I trusted him because I know he is not that kind of guy. Hindi niya ko ‘lolokohin’ or ibebetray ng ganyan. I knew and I felt how much he really loved me… or ang tanga ko lang talaga. All I wanted was closure, yung kakausapin niya ko in person and makikipaghiwalay siya in person pero no… kahit ngayon wala kong natatanggap. Tapos ganito pa malalaman ko. Ang hirap…  
I am truly sorry for the rant and magulong kwento… I just don’t know what to do. All of the people in my life naging friend niya and I had no one to talk to because I don’t want to ruin his image. They all believe na he will not do this type of shit. But f\*ck, I really don’t know what to do. How to move on without closure? How to accept the fact that he is seeing someone na that quick? How can I erase the thought na he is not the good guy I thought he really was…? How can I forget him?  
TL;DR… Ex broke up with me via chat, without any closure. Found out he has another girl a week after our last convo saying he doesn’t have any girl and he just wants to focus on his self.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/13s2373/hi_people_who_have_not_receive_the_closure_they/,t2_c2f74v3o1,2023-05-26 11:34:56,15
Me (M19) and my girlfriend (F19) have been dating for months but I don't know if she's just using me as a rebound.,"Hey everyone, I need your help. This will be a long story and I appreciate it if you listen. I just need your opinions on this and any advice is highly appreciated. Thank you!

Me and my girlfriend have been dating for months now, we're a relatively new couple but in that short time she made me very, very happy. She always puts the effort, made sure she has time for me, makes me her priority and gives me gifts, is clingy, and understands me in the times I'm having a hard time. It almost seems like she's the perfect girl any guy would want and frankly I believe it too. She's just too good to be true. Up until now, I'm starting to believe that.

We met December of 2022, I courted her nung January and we started dating February. We've been through a few dates, all went well. Like I said, she always made sure I was happy and I appreciate it more than she could ever know.

However, there was an incident that happened when we started dating and it made me question everything there is about what's real or what's not. Her ex contacted her and they called. They didn't text, called. I didn't know how long they called, but she told me they called. Apparently, her ex found out that she had a new man and of course like all psychopath exes, he wanted to come back to her just so he can prove a point and that he's better. Fortunately, she said no and of course that's the least you can do about someone that hurt and treated you like trash. 

Speaking about her ex and past relationships, this specific one is the one that destroyed her life. Saying that this guy is the worst is an understatement. (Physical and Mental Abuse, Sexual Assault is one of the FEW things he did to her. Everytime I think about it, my blood boils.) They dated for one year, and here's the first thing that bothers me; they broke up November of 2022. One month only after we met.

Which leaves me on the next thing that bothers me: Even with all that, She brings him up in times, defends him when I talk badly about him, and she STILL has contact with her ex. Although they barely talk, her ex still interacts with her social medias in a way. I stalked her Facebook profile and I even saw that she's still friends with him. She also has contact with his family, more specifically his mom and his aunt. Her approach to this is that they don't have bad blood with each other, the only problem is her ex. Is it normal to feel bothered by this? Or maybe it's just me overthinking again? What can I do to stop thinking about it? I'm scared to confront her about this because she might feel like I'm controlling her. What should I do?

Although I questioned her about it, she said that she has in fact moved on with her ex, but not the things that he did. It's understandable, considering that she went through so much and she didn't deserve all that. That's why it hurts me writing this post because of a person I love. I really love her so much, and I don't wanna lose her. It pains me to think that maybe she's just using me to forget about her ex and I really hope it doesn't turn out that way. Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you.

A tragic story of my life. [Long Story],"Hi! Newbie here Age [26] I am a teenage mom at the age of 17 way back 2012 and been single mom for 2 years. Physical abuse ang unang tatay ng anak ko and drug addict kaya nag hiwalay kami. I had been in relationship with another guy during my college. Wag nyo ko ijudge agad graduate po ako. I'd thought kami na for a lifetime we've been together for 6 years and had 2 kids na. But during those years pinanindigan ko na lang yung sarili ko na hanggang ulirang ina na lang ako at wala ng pangarap. Inalagaan ko yung mga anak ko sa kung ano ang kaya nyang iprovide samin. Minsan i have extra work sa mga kapatid ko to sustain our daily needs. Sa loob din ng 6 years napakaraming pang ccheat na ang naranasan ko. 8 girls in total. Pikit mata ko na lang kinakalimutan at nanghihingi ng pasensya sa mga naging karelasyon nya kahit ang sakit sakit na. Para lang sa mga bata. Pero naubos din ako. Napagod ako. Bukod sa ako na ang ulirang ina ay isa din akong dakilang anak para sa tatay ko na inaalagaan ko nung buhay pa dahil stroke and bedridden. At imbis na may emotional support ako sa lalaking pinagkatiwalaan ko ng buong buo, niloloko lang pala ako. He also been a gambler sa online sabong, playing cards sa mga tropa at kung ano ano pang online games. Buong buhay ko tinuon ko na lang sa pag aalaga sa mga responsibilidad ko. Nakipag hiwalay ako sa kanya. Sa dami ng dahilan. Year 2021 sumugal ako para mag work. Pero hindi ko kinaya yung nature ng work then I met this guy online (foreign) and we had late night talks habang nasa work ako during my stay. He advised me na umuwi samin at patuloy kong alagaan ang tatay ko sya na daw bahala sa sarili kong finances since hindi ko kinaya yung work umuwi ako. Na meet nya tatay ko on virtual pag ka uwi ko and 2 weeks after that namatay ang tatay ko. Hindi na kinaya. Now I am 1 year and 4 months na with my boyfriend abroad we met 4x na personally i visit him in singapore and i have my corporate work as a banker living independently. Pero kinakain ako ng emotional breakdowns ko dahil namimiss ko yung mga anak ko wala sakin. Hindi ko magampanan ang pagiging ina physically dahil feeling ko hindi ako handa. Natatakot ako na magalit sakin yung boyfriend ko which is ang tagal kong wala communications sa mga bata. Araw araw akong umiiyak gabi gabi akong nag bbreakdowns kapag hindi ako naging busy sa work. I never ever had any socialize dahil 24/7 akong on call sa kanya kasi parehas lang ng time dito sa PH. Gusto kong magwala bakit ganito yung naging sitwasyon ng buhay ko. 😭",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/zl0j9j/a_tragic_story_of_my_life_long_story/,t2_uye82hnq,2022-12-14 00:56:38,0
I(19M) am forced to work with my ex(19F) and she is intentionally driving me nuts and I need to either confront her or get over,"Need advice on how to confront either or get over my ex harassing me at work.  
  
This summer I've got a job at this company with my girlfriend (we were still dating at the time). Long story short - I dumped her and she did not take it well. And so after the breakup we still work here and it's not going great..  
  
So fresh into the breakup we've had a conflict, basically I didn't set any boundaries considering work, and she did something very off-putting to me, and I kinda snapped at her. Nothing that unprecedented, it's just that she never saw this side of me. So kind of started this whole work thing after breakup on the wrong foot.  
  
The relationship itself wasn't a fluke btw. It was my first long term experience (different cities, so long distance as well): 5 months, then we kinda took a break because apparently, even though we established mutual feelings for each other (I thought that well, now we are in a relationship with all of the ""I love you"" and speaking on the phone and texting 24/7 - so I acted accordingly), but we didn't establish the fact that we were dating, so the whole 5 months she had a ""sex buddy"" in the face of her ex boyfriend.  
  
In actuality I broke up with her first (somewhere around december), cause she acted distant and some other phycological bullshit I experienced at the time. And about the ""sex buddy"" I found out later after the new years, in a heartbreaking pity call from her (she was trying to get me back...).  
  
So we took a break...  
  
But this whole relationship experience was kinda connected with a childhood trauma of mine - so even after the incident I had feelings for her, and I think that in my mind, the perception of her was working like it would work in an abusive relationship. So, one more long story short - we got back together.  
  
You already get the sense that she was and is kinda crazy. And I think if I were to tell the whole story, I would just get bullied for not running away from her much and much earlier.  
  
So, after another 5 months of multiple arguments, a shitload of cash I've spend on her, all the depressive episodes I had, etc etc - the vacation that we went on together finally got me. Shortly after, when I got some alone time on a press-conference I went without her after the trip, I finally was able to look at the entirety of our situation from my point of view. And so the decision arose.  
  
I presented the breakup to her like ""I wasn't ready for the long term, I got to get my shit together, yade yade"". She cried, but I was free.  
  
And now we're here.  
  
To the point: we work in the same team on a bunch of projects (cause we're still trainees), and the way she sets the group against me, the way she communicates with me in group chats is so toxic. But it's tricky, cause it's very subtle, so that only I know that she's mocking me. I can't really say anything to the bosses - and why would I. I know she is trying to get my attention, and I won't give it to her. But it's hard. She made her profile picture a photo taken in my clothes I forgot at hers, she logged into my google account saved on her computer (forgot to delete) and worked on a shared google doc, etc etc. It's subtle, but the entirety of it collectively on a daily basis, makes me go insane from constant anger and hatred towards her. It's kinda traumatizing to even look at her face during meetings, plus all of that crap.  
  
Yeah, I came out of the relationship kind of a fucked up, and in order to actually get my shit together and move on, I gotta get this resolved.  
  
Quitting is not an option as well, cause I'm a student, and overall, not including her in the equation - it's a dream job that I was looking for for years.  
  
So yeah, don't know what to do at this point. Talking to her is not an option - she will just gaslight me, that I'm imagining all of that, etc.  
  
Tldr: ex girlfriend harasses me at work and I can't really do anything about it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/16jp3jx/i19m_am_forced_to_work_with_my_ex19f_and_she_is/,t2_igk3v0cvh,2023-09-16 05:15:04,2
I (20 F) no longer knows how to help deal with my Boyfriend(21M) ongoing depression or to help him get through it.,"I have been with my boyfriend for a little over 4 years now. High school sweethearts if you may. Before committing to this relationship, he made me aware that he deals with chronic depression. I understood him because I have PTSD and anxiety disorder. At first, his depression was being treated with antidepressants. He also went to therapy at that time. As our relationship progressed, he no longer took his medications and stopped seeing a therapist. Here and there he would have a depressive episode, but we would work through it together. Through his hard times, he would resort to porn or intimate photos. In the past, I’ve discovered that he’s created alternative Instagram accounts to look up what he “gets off to.” I’ve told him that I find that inappropriate since he takes the time to get off to these intimate photos. That he takes the time to hide his inappropriate doings from me, and that he isn’t open to me. I’ve told him I want complete honesty from him. I want him to tell me his urges so that we can resolve them together instead of keeping them a secret. I’ve never told him this is cheating, but I have made him aware that this ruins my self-esteem. But, for the sake of the relationship, I’ve never made his doings a big deal. He repeated his doings in secret throughout our relationship, I confronted him, then I accepted his apologies. He's even gone as far as subscribing to only fans without my knowledge. I found this out by looking at his phone notifications.   
Every time I’ve confronted him about his Instagram accounts, he defends himself by saying I shouldn’t look through his phone. At this point, I have trust issues, and every time I have a feeling he’s hiding something, my intuition is right. After around the 3 ½ year mark, I stopped snooping on his phone. I want to respect his privacy until recently.   
Since the beginning of 2023, he has been going through difficult hardships. I have been by his side 100% of the time. I care for him and his well-being. He has been battling with his depression for the entirety of this year with no breaks from it. I’ve also had some difficult times because of the weight of the situation. I decided to see my therapist biweekly and start antidepressants. However, my boyfriend saw therapy as too expensive and not worth going to. So, his depression progressed. He would lash out by yelling at me, making rude remarks, and somewhat abusing my EAS, Cashew (cat). At the end of June, I almost ended our relationship because I couldn't deal with his lashouts, and not taking care of his health. Now, he goes to therapy, but I feel like nothing is changing. He no longer lashes out at me but still does toward my cat. He still lays his emotions on me. His negative mindset is exhausting. He’s not directing his anger toward me anymore but lays his emotions on me. I feel like I have nothing to be upset about. I’m fine with helping him get through a hard time, but he hasn't done much to help himself. He works less than 20 hours a week, stays up all night, and sleeps all day. I’ve never made a rude comment about his routine, but encouraging thoughts about his health. He talks about suicide but mainly hides his feelings because he knows it is hard for me to hear since I’ve had a failed attempt before. He has told me he has recurring thoughts about suicide. However, I recently found out that he posts youtube videos of what he gets off to, privately. He has multiple videos that he has extracted from other videos for his satisfaction. He has uploaded it to his youtube burner account recently. It hurts me because I’ve been here for him 100% of the time. I’ve supported him throughout his hardest moments. I did not go onto his phone snooping, but I saw a Youtube notification about how his videos are not age appropriate.   
I feel like my support does not mean enough to him. I feel like I am the reason he is always depressed. I try my best but get nowhere. He continues to hide what he gets off to, knowing I don’t agree with his actions. I want to confront him, but I hate to lay on more stress and potentially worsen his depression.

I(18F) stop talking to my friend (18F) of 11 years for whole 2 months. Now she want to reconcile and it didn't turn the way I expected.,"This is my first time writing here and English is not my first language.

So I (18F) have been friends with her(18F) for 11 years. We know each other from childhood. We use to get along really well but it all started when she got to know that my sister is in a relationship with one of her family member. For more context, she( my friend) lives in a joint family and my sister and her fiancee is of same age.

I was in six grade when it all started. She grew jealous of me and started bullying me. She hated it when I score better than her and teased me a lot about my morals and ethics. It became so bad in 7 grade that it mentally made me fucked up. I started scoring less marks intentionally to escape her verbal abuse. In 8 grade we grew apart a lot. Oneday we were giving opinion on a question asked by my teacher and the teacher sided with my opinion as it was correct and more logical according to him. She started arguing with me and was not letting me to write the answer of the sum written by the teacher in her copy(, the teacher use to write the explanation of the topic in 1 of our copy and all the other students use to writes from there as we didn't had a black board then). The teacher told her to give the copy to me as I m also her friend but she told in a straight forward tone that I am not her friend, just a classmate with whom she have to study as she didn't have any choice. I was so heartbroken inside.

Another incident happened where she challenged me to score better marks than her in maths exam. Well I scored 1marks extra than her and she legitimately told me "" Have you forgotten how you failed in maths exam""( I was really struggling in maths that time and failed many times thanks to her that completely crushed my self esteem). My sister contacted a teacher to teach only 2 of us, just only us personally at her home because we were weak in that particular subject.She even bought one of her friends to the tuition where we only 2 use to study without even asking me if I comfortable in letting her friend join the tuition. She even insulted me telling that her mom have made a lots of snacks for me for many years which is not true and that I myself can't even afford to equalise my mother cooking with her mother cooking. 

There are many more but long story short she argued with me when I told her I m going to do my project by my own( before we use to do project together but I was the only one who always use to ends up doing all the projects and she basically always copied all my work taking advantage of me). She is a really self centred person as it's impossible for her to make sense in any conversation that needed communication. We had a heated argument and we hadn't talked to each other for whole 2 months. And if I tell you the truth I was really happy by myself but today she wanted to be friends with me in the midst of a celebration. As I didn't wanted to spoil my mood , I told her okay.

But I regret doing so, it's as if I was forcing myself to smile and talk to her. I am feeling heartbroken. It's like hundred of pieces shattered from my heart. I just can't burn my traumatic memory. Please help me in any way if you can. I know many of you might say to break the friendship with her but I really can't totally as her family and my family have tied the knot that's impossible to break for me and I wouldn't do so. I told my family but they don't seem to really understand what's I m feeling inside. I just don't know what to do. I wish I can disappear. I m really tired.

TL;DR I (18F) stop talking to my friend (18F) of 11 years for 2 months and now she wants to reconcile. Didn't turned out how I expected.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/169ozxb/i18f_stop_talking_to_my_friend_18f_of_11_years/,t2_petehaao,2023-09-04 18:59:19,1
"I, (F26) and my now ex Partner (M27) were together for almost 6yrs but then I decided to finally end it this time, hopefully for good, because there’s no growth in our relationship.","Should I move on na? Or still try to make it work? I (F26), broke up with my boyfriend (27M), last September, but we somehow still remain in contact. We were together for 6 years, he is my first boyfriend. I don't count HS rels/flings (two). I tried to block him for 2 weeks, di ko natiis, kasi parang ang dami ko pang gustong sabihin. How do you move on ba from the only person you've ever loved?

  
Reason for breaking up, a lot. But primarily: Trust and Respect. He doesn't trust me nor respect me. When I say my whereabouts, he will always have a follow up video call, kapag na confirm nya na, ibababa nya na. Wala mang lang kumusta or anything. Kapag magpapaalam ako na I will hangout with my officemates (which I tell him ahead of time), sino mga kasama ko, saan at ano gagawin. Di naman nya ako pinagbabawalan, sinasabi pa nga nya na mag enjoy ako. But sometimes, he will say nasty and disrespectful things. He will say sorry sometimes, say na he didn't mean it that he was just angry, that he loves me so much, he can't lose me. When I say all my heartaches, most of the time, he'll say na, *""matagal na yun"", ""tapos na yan"", ""nag t throwback ka na naman"".* Like the first time I asked him for flowers, way before valentines then it came, *""Oh ayan na flowers mo, masaya ka na?"".*

  
When he left me/walked out on me sa MRT/Trinoma station because I can't decide which Chicken restaurant I wanted to go. I ran after him, but he shove my arms away. And continued to walk away. He didn't even looked back. Wala pa akong car nitong time na to, kaya naka commute lang ako. Gabi na nun, I was wearing a dress, so I went home alone. Which he never did before, kasi lagi nya ako hinahatid, kaya it really pained me. Tas when we talked about it, sabi nya it never happened. Na di nya lang ako narinig, at ang usapan namin half-way kaya umuwi na sya. But whatever daw, he apologize if ganun naging dating sakin. Di naman na daw naulit.

  
One time, this was 2022. I was out with my officemates in a japanese restaurant (1min walk from our office in Makati). He called, so lumabas muna ako so I can hear him properly. He got mad. Na bakit ko sa labas sinagot at hindi sa loob. Na natatakot daw ba ako na makita na lalaki ang katabi ko? And bakit may beer? So of course, in my defense, nakikisama lang ako and it's just San Mig light, a bottle or two. Bakit daw ako umiinom. Sabi ko naman, I see nothing wrong with it, before nga sya pa nagpapatikim sakin ng iba't ibang brand. And kilala naman nya mga kasama ko. It's a dinner lang naman with few drinks. And di naman ako palainom. And we'll finish din by 9pm dahil magsasara na yung restau. Tas he hurled words at me na. Tuwang tuwa ba ako na may iba nagsasabi na maganda ako? Hindi daw ba ako makuntento na sya lang nag sasabi non? Na upon his standards kaya nya ako nagustuhan, at kugn di ako susunod, wala daw sya panghihinayangan sa babaeng umiinom. E, hindi naman talaga ako umiinom. 2022 lang ako natuto uminom ng beer.

  
For the record, he never physically hurt me nor cursed me. But there was this instance na, while I was driving, I can't help but voice out my feelings, frustrations, so much that I stopped the car muna. Oo, mataas tone ko, but I never did cursed him nor insulted him. Di ko lang napigilan mag break down.. And what he did.. he shouted *""AHHHHH!!!""* at my very face. Just to imitate me daw bec that's how I looked and sounded like. And he said sorry after a few minutes.

  
Although, would it still count as abuse? If he R\*ped me? But this was a few years ago pa, in the first year of our relationship (months before our anniv?). Bec he got jealous with someone from work. He threw my phone, grabbed my arms. We were alone in their house then. I was trying to yell, telling him to stop, he covered my mouth while he is restraining my two wrists with the other. I can remember the fear crawling from my feet, and the pain... He apologized and I forgave him. Na I thought and felt that his anger was justified because he was jealous and he loves me so much. Inisip ko, if totoo ba na I'm cheating or having an affair, justified ba lahat nang actions and words nya? For him, for the 6 years, sya lang nagbuhat ng relationship namin, na sya lang nag e effort. But if you will ask me, ganun rin naman naramdaman ko. I stopped asking him and begging him for things para di na ako nasasaktan at na d disappoint. And that's what happened overtime.

  
Hindi ko alam if eto yung sinasabing trauma bond. We keep going back to each other. Di ko sya matiis. Lagi ko syang na m miss. Na kapag sinunod ko lahat ng gusto nya, at susunod lang ako sa kanya, magiging okay na ba ang lahat? I told everything to my friends, and they were both shocked and disappointed. Na bakit ngayon ko lang sinabi, at bat ko hinayaan na ganon. Na I am being manipulated. Dahil alam nya na babalik at babalik ako. Na there is no repairing it na, 6years na namin triny, pero nothing changed. Na wag daw ako magpadala sa sorry, babawi, magbabago na ako blhablh. Tama na daw yung 6 years and just cherish na lang the happy memories. Isipin ko na lang daw yung future na masasayang or if magkaron kami ng kids, ganon ba yung gusto kong maging father figure nila? Na I should stop na my delusion that I can fix him.

  
Of course there are happy memories. Whereas he was so sweet and caring. Our shared jokes, laughter, the comfort I find just lying on his shoulder and chest. Those things. Nasanay na ako na sya kasama ko sa lahat, especially my birthdays, holidays... Unang pasko to at New Year na di kami nag date, at di ko maiwasan malungkot at ma miss lahat. Like every other couple, may masaya naman kaming moments. How I wish na ganun na lang lahat. Sino ba namang babae ang hindi pinangarap na ang First and Only nila e ang the One na rin--forever. I can't help but still think na we can still start fresh, anew.

  
SIguro need ko lang ilabas. Gusto ko na rin ng bagong taon, bagong buhay. Ngayon ,naiisip ko pa rin i chat sya. Masyadong mahaba na. Siguro I will answer na lang questions if may magtatanong.Mahal na mahal ko pa rin sya, pero ayaw ko na magulo at malito pa ang isip at damdamin ko. Gusto ko na lang mag focus sa business, sa career, magpakabusy para hindi ko na sya maisip.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/18x5j6v/i_f26_and_my_now_ex_partner_m27_were_together_for/,t2_pp2lxeuqy,2024-01-03 08:38:54,16
I (M23) Am Pretty Sure My Girlfriend (F21) Is Emotionally Cheating On Me With Her Best Friend (M22) But I Can't Confront Her About It Because She's Currently Dealing With A Lot of Career Problems - The Extended Version,"Me and my girlfriend have been together for almost five years now. It's not a perfect relationship. We've been through ups and downs. We both have our issues, we both make mistakes here and there, but at the end of the day, we still find ways to make it work.

  
One of her major issues is her tendency to ignore me for extended periods of time when she's dealing with a lot of problems or issues. 

  
***Side Note 1.1:*** She was raised in a very old school and toxic household. Her biological father left my girlfriend and her mother. As a result, she was raised in a pseudo-jail, always confined in the four corners of their home. She grew up traumatized, and one of the effects it had on her was she grew up as a bad communicator as she grew up with literally no one to talk to.

  
***Side Note 1.2:*** I called it a pseudo-jail because she cannot leave the house freely. She's 21 and cannot leave their house except to go to her classes. As a result we cannot freely go on dates, and the times we can video call are very limited as well. These are two facts I was forced to accept because I love her.

  
I knew coming before committing into this relationship that she was somehow mentally unstable. Aside from her family, she also went through an abusive relationship before me.

  
***Side Note 2:*** Her Ex-Boyfriend would only use her when she's convenient. When she's not, he would talk to other girls and cheat on her. He doesn't listen and care for her and even punches her when he feels irritated. This relationship scarred my girlfriend for life. 

  
But despite all of that, I still went ahead and pursued her because she willingly accepted me for who I am. So it became my mission to try and help her change for the better.

  
But communicating, is something she just couldn't improve upon.

  
At first, she would not message me for a couple of days, citing family problems as a reason. Even though I wanted to help her and be by her side, I understand where she was coming from. So I didn't bat an eye. But as time goes on, periods in which she would ignore me, grew longer and longer. 

  
A month in 2020. Two months in 2021 - both due to family problems that she would want to deal by herself. And the longest, eight months in 2022 - to ""fight her own demons."" There other smaller instances, but I'm not gonna add them to the total. 

  
As she continuously does this I started having mental health issues. Anxiety and panic attacks just to name a few, all because of her. I tried messaging her everyday but she won't even see my messages. But I didn't bother telling her this because I don't wanna add on to her problems.

  
In all of the instances above, it was me who tried and save the relationship. It was me who fixed everything and gave the initiative. I was not at fault, but it was me who saved everything. 

  
After that eight month ""ghosting"" that she did, things kinda went back to normal. She started communicating again, we celebrated our fourth year anniversary, the loves was back - our relationship is slowly getting better than ever before. Despite the limitations to what we can do, we made the best of every opportunity.

  
But things took a turn yet again this past March.

  
***Side Note 3:*** I haven't mentioned it yet, but hindi kami ""legal"" on her side. Her family wants her to finish her studies first before going in to a relationship. Add the abusive relationship she went through in the past, it made her family way too overprotective of her.

  
We met at a local 7/11 as I asked her to bring me some books I previously shared her before. Afraid of being seen in public by family members, she wanted me to leave immediately and not wait for her. We haven't met in a while so I wanted to stay for a while. 

So I stayed until the very end. I should have respected her word, but we rarely get to meet so I stubbornly stayed.  She got mad at me for this and ignored me yet again for almost two months. 

  
Here is where the story actually starts.

  
She didn't messaged me until late May. But I've apologized to her on multiple occasions before she decided to talk to me again. Some even say I didn't do anything wrong. 

  
But in the almost two months we've been apart, a lot has happened, a lot has changed. First, is she became really close to her colleague, a guy from the same organization. They started being close when I was out of the picture. Before they were just colleagues, but apparently they became really, really close friends while I was gone. 

  
AND APPARENTLY, THE GUY CONFFESSED HIS FEELINGS TO MY GIRLFRIEND. BUT APPARENTLY HE KNEW THAT SHE HAD A BOYFRIEND, SO HE DID NOT CONTINUE. 

  
***Side Note 4:*** I am from a Big 4 University, while she's in a university within Intramuros. 

  
I knew from the get go that things were different. She's replying was too slow now, unlike before when it was almost instantaneous. She would also send far fewer sweet messages. Before we would send sweet messages throughout the day, but when we talked again in May, that was gone. I thought she was just taking a while to come back to normal, but I soon realized that something wrong could be going on.

  
The June rolls around. Their organization got into some deep, deep problem that never thought would happen. If they couldn't fix it, their admission to that university could be in jeopardy.   
So all throughout the month, they focused on doing fixing their mistakes. And it just so happened that my girlfriend and the guy friend where in the center of the problem. So they're always together. In meetings and in doing paperwork. 

  
As a good boyfriend, I just let her do her thing. That's her passion, so I just support her. Even though sometimes she would take most of the day doing organization work, I waited patiently all the time, just like before. Never cheated, never even thought of cheating. I just waited.

  
Here's where I started being jealous and suspicious. The very limited free time she has, she spends on her guy friend. After meetings, after the paperwork, she would ask permission if they could hang out and play. I said sure go ahead. At least, she asked for permission. It gave me peace of mind.

  
But after a while, they just started hanging out and playing without my permission and knowledge. I thought she was still busy with meetings, but there they are, online in the video game, playing for hours. 

  
I confronted her about this. All I needed was validation and assurance. All she gave me was this.

  
*""Walang Meron""    ""We're Just Friends""   ""Trust Me More""* For her, this is assurance.

  
So I did. I believed in her. I trusted her. 

  
But two more instances made me question things even more. 

  
One night, at around 8:00 pm, she asked me for permission as she wanted to call her guy friend, who's mental health problems got triggered by the problems of their organization. Mental health is no joke so I said sure, go ahead. Her last message to me was at around 11:00 pm. Her next reply was at around 4:30 am. She said their call just concluded, and she was going to sleep. 

  
I was already mad at this point, but I don't wanna add on to her existing problems. So I remained calm... Until it happened again.

  
I was getting fed up, they were playing all the time. She was not inviting me. She was late on her replies. Her messages are stale. She barely says ""I Love You"" anymore. I was getting really suspicious.

  
***Side Note 5:*** My suspicions and jealousy stems from a traumatic relationship that happened six years ago. Almost the same scenario. My girlfriend at that time, cheated on me with her boy best friend. 

  
***June 15.*** I wanted to see her, so that we can talk things through. She couldn't, she was busy with paperwork. So I asked if we could call. Again, busy. She can call her friend, but not me?! Her last reply to me was at 8:00 pm. She told me she don't know what time she'll finish, so she can't promise that she can call. After that... Complete silence. No messages, no updates. Nothing. I stayed up until 3:00 am. Nothing. 

  
She replied to me, the following day, ***June 16. At 1:30 pm***. Nearly ***17 and a half hours*** so no communications. Know what she did that night? Apparently they called all night as the boy best friend had yet another mental health attack. 

  
I was angry. I couldn't control and hold my emotions anymore. You couldn't make time to call me but for him, you can?! I exploded. I demanded her to see me or at least call me. 

  
She said ***""wait, there's an emergency meeting.""***

  
I was breaking down at this point but I waited. Until 5:00 pm. When I said ""Ang tagal Naman.""   
So I checked the video game they are playing and turns out, they've been playing since 4:00 pm. Here I was, thinking she was still busy. But nope, she's having fun for an hour now with the guy she said I should not worry about.

  
I then proceed to spam her with messages and calls. She then had the audacity to get mad at me and actually ignored me for that entire night and the whole of the next day.

  
She went offline for the entirety of ***June 17.*** She wouldn't be online on anything until the midnight of ***June 18, around 12:30 am.*** She would go online on the video game, and of course, she's playing with him.

  
I spammed her again with messages until she finally replied on Messenger. I thought I would be getting an explanation, but instead all I got was invalidation and gaslighting.  She then proceeded to ignore again for the rest of that day. She claims they were only hanging out to ""cope"" with the problems of their org. She then added that I just adding to her problems and that I don't know how much she's already suffering. 

  
Pissed, mad, and disappointed that Sunday, I decided to look around, and find more clues. I saw the guy's Instagram. There, in a story highlights, was a picture of him and my girlfriend in their org room, acting all sweet and happy. She was even blushing. I dug up Facebook posts and found instances where the two were clearly interacting, and even ""flirting"" in a way. Apparently, she also shared the very same picture in her stories. 

  
The came Monday. We were supposed to have lunch that day, so I knew she was in campus. I messaged her about going and she finally replied to me, saying, no. She then claims she's going to be busy the entire day, and will have no time for me. 

So then, I messaged the friend. The guy friend also happens to be the leader of their organization. So I asked him about their lunch break. He did not reply to me, but my girlfriend did. Angrily. ""Wag mong idamay"" she said angrily. 

  
Then I asked her about the sweet photos i saw. Her reply, ""Bakit Bawal Ba?""

  
She then, yet again, ignored me for the rest of that day. We finally had a decent conversation on June 19. I told her everything, I was a bit angry at her. I was emotional, I was crying and breaking down during our call. Towards the end, I asked her four questions.

1. Does she have feelings for the guy? She said no.
2. Does the guy still have feelings for her? She claims no. But who knows really?
3. Does she still love me? She said there's a lot on her mind and can't answer right now.
4. Is she willing to rebuild and start over? She said there's a lot on her mind and can't answer right now.

  
After that, I gave her nine days to think everything through and finish the problems of their org. Those nine days were no contact days for us. She claimed that everything would be wrapped up on the 24th. But while that was happening, my girlfriend and her best friend still remained in contact.

  
They attended a leadership seminar for two days. I'm confident he was the one who took the photos my girlfriend posted on her IG. After they got home, they would continue playing all day, while they are still ""busy"" with their organization's problem.

  
The nine days have passed but they're still not finished with their problems. Apparently everything got pushed back this month so they no longer has control as to when their problem would end.   
She has yet to message me. All of my messages just went straight to her inbox. 

  
I want to confront her. Because what she is doing is emotional cheating - or even worst, it could already be micro cheating. 

  
What should I do? How should I approach this situation? I don't wanna leave her. I want to fix and work things out but I don't want to add on to her problems.

  
Any advice is highly appreciated. Thanks everyone. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/14u2pli/i_m23_am_pretty_sure_my_girlfriend_f21_is/,t2_pmon2goh,2023-07-08 20:16:20,7
"21 years age difference (27F,47M), everything is a fairytale except for one thing.","So here it goes… Just want to ask what you guys think of my situation because ako mismo, nalilito na. Please bear with me as this will be long.

I met my boyfriend on the last months of 2021. We met in a coffee shop in BGC and the whole thing was kind of a whirlwind romance in a good way. I was 25 (25F), just got out of a really abusive and tiring relationship and just transferred jobs, so in short, I was starting my life a knew. He was 45 (45M), he was, at that time, separated for 11 years (legal wife) and had an 8-year relationship which ended 2019. He has 2 kids, one near my age and the other a few years younger than me. 

We met at the end of September 2021, when remote set ups were still a thing and we weren’t required to go to the office pa. I felt like we started out relationship with literally a bang, we fell in love, we spent almost everyday together (except for the weekends), we went on road trips, ate everyday together, etc. It was such a bliss and we were both on a love high undeniably. 

Until December 2021 came, when I found out that his annulment papers were still not filed. I felt like binuhusan ako ng very cold water kasi while I was letting my hair down and finally enjoying being treated right the first time in my whole life, malalaman ko na parang there was no end in sight pala for his relationship with his wife. I don’t know if it was my fault for immediately thinking na naka process na his papers when I met him but he literally told me that he was “legally separated for 11 years” when I met him. Those were his exact words. When I found out na wala pa palang any progress with the papers (as in not yet filed), bumagsak ako from my high. I cried a lot, I couldn’t sleep, I kept on asking when he was planning to file it so he promised me na January of 2022 daw. 

Come January 2022, I asked him about the papers again, and may dumating na naman na another condition, we had to wait for his 16 year daughter to migrate with the mom before he files kasi baka daw magka effect yung pag file niya with his daughter’s papers. So I waited until March and nagka delay delay pa the migration because of the pandemic delays. To cut this part of the story short, his daughter was able to migrate na August of 2022. 

But some time in April of 2022, my parents found out about us and ang daming nangyari. I won’t put everything into detail but here are some points to remember: 
- My parents did not approve of our relationship
- I had to bring in my mother’s siblings and my dad’s brother for support para my parents won’t kulong me in our house because I didn’t really wanna go back to live there again. 
- We had to fake cool off for everyone to back off for the sake of my safety (because my parents have bugbog histories) 
- During the fake cool-off, he promised me na once the papers were filed na, he was going to show it to my parents given na my parents were telling me na that was the problem. (But surprise, surprise, it was really the age. My mom was 51 that time and my boyfriend was 46 so you get it) 

So let’s go back to the migration of his daughter. Si daughter left ng August and due to the promises he made, I was waiting for him to tell me na the papers we’re already filed kasi wala na need hintayin or what. So September came, we celebrated our 1st anniversary, October came, November came, there was still no news of regarding his papers. When I ask him, palaging wait lang or he answers in circles then the real problem revealed itself bigla. It was the funds daw. So he told me to wait again. This time wait daw mag December 2022 para his big office bonuses goes na directly to the lawyer and dirediretso na the process of the papers. 

At this point, I was losing hope na and tbh our relationship was already getting rocky because of, you guessed it right, the papers. At some point I got tired of asking and just let him be. Until December of 2022 came na. Middle of December na and he still wasn’t updating me about the papers which I was waiting for him to at least update me. But no, I had to go on a crying spree again just for him to give me something man lang. Anything. 

This time, he tells me na he already gave the funds needed to his lawyer to get the papers moving BUT, there’s a big BUT. He didn’t show me any proof. While I wasn’t really expecting for him to show me some kind of proof, I at least expected for him to offer it automatically because of the trust issues that I’ve developed sa topic na yun. But instead, all I got was bakit daw hindi ko siya ma trust about it and even told me na “sige pag pinakita ko sayo, hiwalay na tayo”. To give you context, marriage is really important to me and he views naman yung pangungulit ko regarding the papers as bakit daw parang naka depend doon yung love ko for him. 

Now it’s almost March of 2023, I really don’t know na what’s happening and honestly I got tired na of asking about it so I just let it be. But syempre, it still pops in my head every once in a while and I wonder. I had to give up a lot of my dreams and replan for him, because of that issue and for me, naiisip ko lang na I hope it’s worth it, I hope gumagalaw na talaga yung papers para naman like we have an end goal. 

But I really, really love this guy so much. He gave me so much. He taught me so much. My independence, my strength, the good of my health, the life that I’m living right now, I owe it all to him. And if you knew all of my history from way, way back, I can tell you that I’m living my best life right now, with him. 

But again, sometimes, naiisip ko, is giving up things that are important to me worth it? Like may pupuntahan ba ito? I want to become a wife, I want to become a mom, I want to build a life of my own with my own family. But by being with him, I don’t know if any of that will happen because there’s a possibility na I’ll just be forever the girlfriend lang. 

I thought of it and sabi ko, you know maybe it could work kasi I don’t need marriage naman to build a life with the person that I love. But the thing is, he doesn’t want to move in with me until hindi ayos ang papers because my parents threatened to have him arrested because, well, he’s still married and at the end of the day, I’m a concubine. So no to really having a life din together as we both are living separate lives as of the moment.

But to clear things lang, we are happy. He treats me right, he supports me, he takes care of me more than my parents actually. Sobrang okay lahat except for that issue. And also there’s a factor na I haven’t met anyone from his family although I think they know about me naman.

What do you guys think I should do? Please help me. And no, I don’t want to end my relationship with him. What’s the best thing to do in my situation?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/11cl3rg/21_years_age_difference_27f47m_everything_is_a/,t2_5z2t4c08w,2023-02-27 00:15:47,9
My(37M) partner(36F) of 15 years has completely worn me down... I'm at my breaking point... and TBH I'm terrified.,"This is my(37M) first ever reddit post... and on a throwaway account no less. TBH I didn't realize Reddit was used like this till a few Reddit Tik Tok accounts started making content posts several months ago, and between those videos and reading Reddit posts, I decided to seek some help. It will be pretty long so I'll give a summary before I bare my soul, anonymously to you all. Seeking advice, I don't know if I want to support. I have noticed that several posts I've read have mentioned this can be sort of therapeutic. So here goes. 

TL;DR I(37M) have been with my partner(36F) for 15 years. In that time we've gone through quite a bit with our relationship. Between her anxiety, an absolute fear of change, and what I hope is subconsciously sabotaging, I have reached the end of my ropes. I don't want to leave her, I have been open with this with her in terms of explaining how I feel, I've explained multiple times that what she is doing is destroying me, to no avail. Add in that there's been no sexual intimacy between us for over 7 years now... none at all. 
It hasn't all been bad, she at times has been the very thing keeping me together. Shes taken care of me when I was sick, badly injured... First time I cried in front of anyone was her. I truly do love her. Most of the time it's ok, it use to great most of the time, then good.... now we're at ok. But at best at the moment she's a roommate who I don't sleep with, don't have sex with, doesn't pay half of the bills.


Now for the full story, there are about 15 years to unpack here, I apologize in advance as this will be a rather long post, parts of which are going to be hard to read through. I'm going to include a short brief of both myself and my partner first to help keep this long post as short as possible.

- Myself:  I'm a large and tall guy, can be intimidating as I don't smile too often unless I'm with friends, despite the intimidation factor, despite that and being anti-social, I developed the ability to be a great listener, for some reason people like to come to me to vent, still to this day, although only very few can as I've pretty much just withdrawn myself from society, that will be explained in the post. I have also suffered through insomnia most of my life, which does get worse with stress. I think I also suffer from depression, at least of late. 
I am a hard worker, I love to work as it is my only real outlet mentally. You put in a hard day's work, and the negative thoughts aren't so loud. I am not religious, sort of spiritual if that makes any sense, primarily I hate conformity. I do have an extensive history of anger management problems dating back to childhood, years of anger management during my adolescent and teenage years, coupled with football, menial labor, and self-reflection, I had a really good hold on it, however over the last couple of years as I keep taking hits mentally, those holds aren't tight anymore... honestly I feel more like a ticking time bomb now than I ever have... that's the terrifying part. 
Lastly, I believe in mutual respect in any relationship whether it be with a friend or with my partner. Mutual respect includes trust, privacy, cooperation, and understanding.

- My partner: While on the shorter side, She's the life of the party. Loves to go to parties, loves to be out and about, and loves her family and friends. She's essentially the, ""If walls would talk, she'd talk to them"" type of person. Loves her pets, and if she can figure out and take care of her anxiety and fear of change, she would/will be a great mother. That last part is key as she's based her entire being on being a mother. On our third date, we had a rather frank conversation about what we wanted and did not want in our relationship. We went over fidelity, goals, wants, etc... and one thing she made clear was that she wanted children, and while I explained that I didn't want children, if this worked, I'd do what I could to make that happen. It's harder on her side. Over the years we have both put on weight, but I don't find her any less attractive. Unfortunately, that weight hasn't helped her in that department, but it's pretty much mute as we've not had any physical intimacy in a long time.
The negatives are forthcoming, and at times crippling fear of change coupled with uncontrolled anxiety that she will not seek help from a therapist, she does have medication, which she refuses to keep up with. I have spent countless hours researching ways for me to help her with it, and have spent too much money, to no avail. Lastly, there's what can only be described as laziness, which I've only now realized is laziness putting this together. 
Alright, now from the beginning. 

When we first started dating, I had roommates, despite having roommates, within the first few weeks she was spending more nights with me than her parents. Gradually moving more and more stuff over in terms of clothing and personal items. I didn't mind as I loved her being around. Call that the honeymoon phase. We went out, had adventures, decent amount of sex, etc... life was good mostly. The problem came up with her trust and respecting my stance on mutual respect. In a relationship, mutual respect to me goes as follows.
- Respect: Both public and private, talk and treat me with the same respect you expect yourself. Keep any and all hostility out of the public eye. Allow me to be a man and you a woman. If I need to protect you, I will, you can't fight against that, with there being absolutely no need to publicly berate, talk down,  or shame the other party in public. Both parts she has abused multiple times...
- Trust: If we say something, believe that it's true unless proving otherwise. No snooping, eavesdropping, 
- Privacy: What happens in our relationship and our lives together is between us. I don't talk about my private life to anyone, I don't hide her, she's on all my social media, my friends and close family knew her, met her. I just don't talk about our relationship and I expect the same in return. Instead, her immediate family knows everything about our relationship... everything, well anything that doesn't make her look bad.
- Cooperation: We're in this relationship together, we need to work together to make it work. That is physically, financially, emotionally, and mentally. If one person is doing it all, often with the partner going against it, it creates an untenable situation as I've now learned. 
- Understanding: understanding is straightforward, if one is doing something that the other doesn't like, communicate, understand where they're coming from and change what you can. Keep communication up so that you work on your shortcomings. 

Despite all of this,  I was madly in love with her, I still love her, which is why it hurts as much as it does I think... I proposed to her after a year. We initially tried planning a wedding, I even agreed to a church wedding if she wanted. She couldn't make up her mind and shot down any suggestions. To me, she's my wife, too the government we're partners. Eventually, she gave up on that, I still make suggestions, and try to give her ideas so she can have her ceremony, again to no avail.
These are all things I discussed with her when we had the baby talk. These are all things that she's both consciously and I think subconsciously gone against in one form or another. 
I'm not sure when it started, but after a few months, I noticed signs of her snooping. While we each knew each other's passwords, it was expected, at least from me, that that didn't give you the right to snoop. It goes against trusting your partner. I'd notice the ""last logged in"" time in my email would be different, something I noticed after noticing my phone in places I didn't leave it. I'd confront her and she'd deny it. I'd let it go, but a couple of days later it's happening again. At the time I worked 3 jobs, a full-time menial labor job, a bouncer/doorman for a couple of night clubs, and my side job which eventually became my full-time business. Throughout the night she'd drive by,  checking up on me, she even did it with her mother once. At first, it was cute, then when she'd deny it despite seeing her, it got annoying. She'd always give herself away when she ask me about the women who I walked to their cars on particular nights... the woman being the bottle girls and bartenders, and when they'd have a rough night or feel threatened, we'd(security) make sure they'd get to their vehicles safely. Being the doorman, while being assertive, you still have to be somewhat hospitable and friendly. Couple that with lonely women, and you will get napkins with numbers on them from heavily intoxicated women... and in a couple of instances, men. You take the number, be friendly, and send them on their way disposing of when able out of their sight. Something you don't always remember to do on busy nights. Naturally, snooping finds those very notes. And while going through both my phone and email, still found it necessary to confront me. Which would result in a fight. It got so bad with the snooping and denial that I got tired of it, I warned her that if it didn't end, I'd leave her. But she kept doing it, so I had a very close friend send me illicit messages from his girlfriend's phone which wasn't saved in my contacts. She confronted me, and I gave her the proof of the setup, packed her shit up, and broke up with her. That lasted about a week. We talked, and got together and it did get better, for a time. She doesn't snoop anymore, or she got so good at it that I haven't been able to catch her. 
Over time I found out that she was telling her mom and sister about our relationship, I think sexual info as well. Her father can't keep a secret. 
See I do love sex, I love to give orally and get orally just two problems, I don't cum quickly, and I'm not that big, not small either, big enough to offer pleasure, small enough for it to affect me subconsciously. With that in mind, I made it a priority to be able to bring a woman to climax orally in case I couldn't do so with penetration. As a result of that, I ended up loving that part and getting it. Any woman before my partner, when you made sure they were taken care of, there's a certain amount of enthusiasm you get in return both orally and then sexually. If I got them off, especially first and often again, they would make sure I would get off. This wasn't the case with my partner. I'd make sure she'd get off, often multiple times, and while at first, she would try, she'd give up quickly. To the point of having to take care of myself by myself. I'd get excuses that I took too long, too eventually that sex hurt for her, mind you again I'm not that big, and I'm not ignorant to mood or lubrication. But she would never turn away getting oral. As time went on, as I got more and more no's and more and more excuses, I guess I just stopped asking... I also stopped giving. We haven't had sex since at least 2016... haven't been intimate at all sexually since 2019. Please don't think I haven't tried to change the situation. I've tried exploring with toys to no avail, talking about it which falls on deaf ears, too talking about an open relationship which she categorically turns down and refuses. Yet her family knows my size and how I feel about it, as well as my inability to ""cum fast""... sex is a huge part of a relationship... having a partner who doesn't view you the same way you view her sexually has broken me a few times...

But if she doesn't like to have sex, what about her desire to be a mother? When we tried having a baby the first couple of years, sex wasn't that bad and after a few attempts, she went to a doctor. We tried the medication, vacation, to invetro... single handily the most embarrassing situation I've ever been in was in that room... but it was for her and what she wanted and I did everything I could... till she gave that up too. During that whole time, her sister got married and while having the same hardships getting pregnant, is now pregnant and giving birth soon. 

The last part and possibly longest part is her inability to deal with her anxiety and fear of change. And believe me, in this instance they're not the same thing. While her fear of change can trigger her anxiety, her anxiety is caused by something else. Over the years as it's gotten worse, I've spent so many hours getting to help her. From researching about it, to how to help her when she has attacked, to items that can help her cope. From weighted blankets to edibles, and everything in between. She refuses every attempt at help.  She refuses to talk to a professional and refuses to take the medication prescribed by her doctor. The fear of change is so bad that you can't even plan for the future. After years at my menial labor job, I wanted to take my business and go full-time with it. While planning it, and getting arrangements in place, she and her mother would try and sabotage it. Mainly mentally. How can you say you support someone or believe in them, to turn around and say that what they want to do won't work, it's not worth the risk. This would result in fights,  which got so bad that I had to give her the ultimatum, get on board or leave. She chose to stay, and while she didn't talk against it, she also didn't help with getting it set up. When I finally made the change it was another fight.  Which hasn't stopped. When it's bad, and there's been a lot of bad times, especially during covid, and whenever I toss ideas at her for her opinion, it's a negative. Again this is something I talk to her about, and it never changes. I started my business almost 10 years ago, and it's still open. When it comes to what is next or what I want to do, I can't go into too much detail as it may cement an ID of who I am to anyone who is reading this and know me. Let's just say I long for a life of self-prosperity for both myself and my friends free of societal dependency. Something that requires a lot of planning... something that is also heavily fought back against. While I get the ""that's a good idea"", there's no dialogue. There's no give when any sacrifice is proposed. This goal requires a couple of years of discipline and sacrifice to achieve, one that she refused till she had no choice. Just after COVID, the apartment we had rented for almost 10 years was sold to a new owner who wanted to move in. The move I had been trying to do since 2019 was to give up the apartment and move into my business location for 1 to 2 years, and with the money we save, we can pay cash for the next part and not rely on a loan, another thing that was fought against. My business location is located in an industrial building of trades mixed with a doctor's office and a gym. My unit itself takes up well over 2k sqft,  with a bathroom,  shower, and small ""kitchen"", of which not even half the space is being used by my business. While it's not in my lease that you can't do what I wanted, it's also not something I believe they would approve of. Well when the apartment building sold, it was the perfect solution. Why spend all that money on high rent, first last deposit when we can move and consolidate? Even with eviction, she still fought me. To the point, I took my stuff, or everything but her clothes to the shop and said she could go to her parents, only after this did she finally get on board. Set up our living arrangements in a part of my unit that doesn't have anyone near it most of the time. You can't see into my unit, but there's a part of my unit that is wedged between the offices of a trades business on one side and the offices of a gym on the other. Loud sounds make their way through the walls in those parts rather easily. In that part, I have had a few recliners set up for the last few years comfortable recliners. As I don't think the owners would approve, no one knows we moved into my unit. However, my partner snores very loud, and so do I, however, with my sleep mask I don't. She doesn't wear one so her snoring is full blast. This is why I set up the living arrangements where I did.  However, she likes to fall asleep on one of those recliners, which wouldn't be an issue if she slept at night. But she purposely stays awake till 4 am most nights and sleeps well into the afternoon. I keep making her aware of this, to the point that I've had a couple of meltdowns over the last year. She knows that I know it's being done intentionally, after each fight she doesn't do it for a day or two and then goes right back to doing it. She was laid off about 2 months ago, and her behavior of staying up all night didn't help. The money that was saved up is rapidly dwindling. She isn't looking for work and isn't trying to change her behavior, and now without a job she sleeps all day, and stays up all night. If we're caught here and evicted, I lose my business. I lose my business I don't know what I'll do.  Now it's affecting me, to the point it's hard to get out of bed every day. Depression has been hitting me harder and harder as I see no way out. I'm constantly angry, I'm always on edge, and she doesn't care. Not that I ever expected or asked for, now that I think of it,  there's never been an ""I'm proud of you"", ""good job"", or thank you for what you do for us from her, instead I get what feels like constant negativity and doubt.80+ hour weeks to support us between multiple jobs when she barely worked, to trying to set up our future... I want(ed) to spend the rest of my life with this woman, but as I've been writing this all out and reflecting, I don't think she's ever loved or respected me... as I keep hitting walls and I fall deeper, the negative thoughts get louder. They've always been there, but these last few months they're so loud... some days they're deafening. I don't know what to say... I guess I don't need advice, rereading this the answer is obvious... but it's not easy. I don't think I can, but I'm afraid of what happens to me if I don't...

If you're still with me here, thank you for reading. I've tried to make sure all of the Grammer is right. I don't know how to end this... let me know your thoughts.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/10hvb1t/my37m_partner36f_of_15_years_has_completely_worn/,t2_vn7rghn6,2023-01-22 00:38:33,5
