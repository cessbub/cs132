"Discipline should not require physical abuse, so stop justifying corporal punishment",,https://pop.inquirer.net/335170/discipline-should-not-require-physical-abuse-so-stop-justifying-corporal-punishment?fbclid=IwAR1eIte4e28ZGIM-no1d1F0M7KjCCwxt-en1cMfEOMrK7NEi_Fj55alkd-A,t2_176qd0,2022-10-22 19:11:29,36
Is it possible to file for permanent protection order if the guy is not physically abusive?,"Hi! I’m a woman with children. We left and ghosted my ex-boyfriend due to him being a freeloader. I have decided to leave him because he does not contribute to the household at all, and we all believe we are better without him..

*Important: we are not married, my children are biologically from my late husband.

As title says, my ex-boyfriend was not physically abusive nor was he verbally abusive DURING our relationship within the same household, but he did start to send verbal threats when we left him. He was quite the laid-back guy, only that he was very irresponsible and held no initiative as a father.

There was no direct life-threatening statements such as “I will kill you”. His threats were more of the “I know your every move, I have the connections, and I will haunt you down” kind. He has also spitted threats like how he can get connections from people in the schools of my children so he can “spy” and “observe” on them.

Please give advice if permanent protection order is impossible for this situation. Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/11bsg3u/is_it_possible_to_file_for_permanent_protection/,t2_umoxgxzn,2023-02-26 02:50:00,0
Abuse to Physical Therapist interns in a certain big Hospital in Mandaluyong,"I was recently admitted in a big hospital in Mandaluyong. I needed Physical therapy and was able to talk to the intern/OJT student working with the actual PT grad.  
She said that they were not given allowance or any salary. They basically pay for commute and food to work for free. I know this is not too bad, as I too had no allowance or salary when I did my OJT.  
The kicker is, they had to PAY to be taken by the hospital. What the f!  
The amount was not too clear, it is between 40k-100k for 8 months.  
Kala ko ba illegal na to or na ban na to for nursing a decade ago.   
I remember naging hot topic to dahil sa influx ng supply ng nursing grads natin before. How come these other branches of healthcare was overlooked?  
Sabi nga ng nurse na nakausap ko, bawal na to for nurses.

Anyone can shed any light?

I'm a 16-year-old who wants to run away from home at 19. Does anybody have tips? [TW: physical and emotional abuse],"I'm gonna tell something about myself first. I'm from Cavite. I just turned 16 in March. My family seems to be the nicest people you'll meet. They volunteer at church, they volunteer for Leni, and they help people out during crisis. But they're never there for me and my two younger brothers.

I am undiagnosed, but I've been dealing with symptoms of OCD since I was 10-years-old. It got really worse when I turned 14, and I keep getting intrusive thoughts and I'm anxious 24/7. I opened up about it to my family, but I shouldn't have. They said if I don't stop, they're going to exorcise me or lock me up in a mental asylum. They told me they don't want to help me, because they're embarrassed of me. They don't want our neighbors to find out that somebody in the family is mentally unstable. And almost every day, they're insulting me about it and kept calling me crazy.

(While I am writing this, my mom purposely tried to break a mug because she's mad at me while verbally abusing me. She's also shaming me in front of my family. She just called me ""walang kwenta"" and ""malandi"". I'm currently hiding right now just so I could use my phone.)

I had a boyfriend, but we broke up which led me into a lot of breakdowns every week. He's manipulative and I left him so I could work on myself and my studies. I've been doing bad in my studies coz I get exhausted from dealing with my mental health, and it would've help me a lot if my family just listened to me instead of silencing me. Whenever I breakdown about the things I'm dealing with, my mom verbally abuses me as if I have no rights to cry. I couldn't vent to anybody too coz I can only vent to my vent to my boyfriend, but he was just using me for his own happiness.

I just wish I could live normally without these people. There's not a day where I'm not insulted, manipulated, or gaslighted. I feel like I exist just so they have somebody that they could talk shit about. And it's been stressful for me and I just want to have a peace of mind.


Now I'm gonna explain why I want to leave and run away from home. My family, especially my mom and grandma, always verbally uses me. They won't leave me alone. Whenever I want space, they won't respect that. Instead, they'd insult me. And they always get mad at me. every time I open up to them about my insecurities, they get mad. When I tell them about my little every day achievements, rhey'd talk shit about me. Sometimes their getting mad at me turns into physical abuse. They'd often hit me and throw things on me instead of letting me explain. That's how they silence me. I try my best to be the daughter that they want me to be, but I'm always a failure to them. Also, if I don't get out of here, I can't get help for my mental health. I couldn't work on myself here because when I do, my family always brings me down.

Currently, I am looking for jobs suitable for me so I could at least earn money before I leave, but I have no idea how. I'm planning to do well with my studies too. Any tips? I just don't wanna spend more years of my life here. Thank you btw! :D

(i'm sorry if this is long, i don't post a lot on reddit. im sorta scared of posting too so pls dont judge T~T)

"Guys, I need help. It's about being in an verbally and physically abusive household","Thanks for clicking, I need help. My girlfriend (who is 21 and no longer a minor) has been undergoing verbal abuse as long as she can remember. When her parents found out of our relationship, they escalated the abuse into physical; saying that she even has bruises to show. They also broke the phone that I got her so she can't contact anyone else. She's being held captive against her will. Guys, I really love her and it hurts me so much that I can't help her directly (as much as I'd like to beat the dad to a pulp, I can't cause legal reasons, of course). 

Is there anything I/we can do to put a stop to this? Is there any law in the Philippines that can help her?

PS. I forgot to mention, they're a ""holy"" family. The dad's a pastor.

Napakagago na ng mga estudyante ngayon sa public schools.,"Update: Nakakuha kami ng statements sa mga kaklase nung mga batang involved and may mga malala pa pala silang ginagawa bukod sa mga nalaman ng kaibigan ko. It will be filed sa school. We'll see kung ano gagawin ng officials tungkol dito.

TW: Verbal sexual abuse.

Teacher yun kaibigan ko sa isang public school and binabastos sya ng mga estudyante behind her back. Nadulas lang yun isang bata (junior high but currently repeating the grade for the nth time) sa isa pang teacher kaya nalaman nya hanggang sa kinausap ng kaibigan ko. Dun nya nalaman na pinapagusapan sya and kung ano ano sinasabi sa kanya regarding her physical features and what they will do to her. Sobrang nakakagalit lang kasi mga bata ito and kawawa yun kaibigan ko, hindi na sya makaharap sa mga estudyante para makapagturo kasi naiisip nya yun sinasabi ng mga bata tungkol sa kanya.

We plan to pursue legal action against the students involved kasi mukhang di ito papansinin ng school. Kaso mukhang yun law is for protecting students lang. Any legal advice kung ano possible na gawin sa students na nambabastos ng teacher? I think this is verbal sexual abuse na. May magagawa ba kami dito?

Don't hit kids.,"Clicked on a Raffy Tulfo video about a girl reporting her mother for physical abuse (complete with pics of her with blood and bruises) and the comments were more or less saying that they should have the right to hit kids because they're parents and it's justifiable in the Bible.

This country has proven again and again that it doesn't care about children. From the subpar education to being known as the capital for child p*rnography, this country only cares about children on a performative basis- that is, if they are doing well within the systems they are placed in.

You are only a good child if you never question the things done to you. You are a good child if you obey. No wonder this country isn't improving.

I have an older brother who has autism and have >!sexually assaulted!< me when I was young but nobody believes me since he's ""autistic"". He has also let out his anger on me whenever he had tantrums growing up, and it only recently stopped.

I have been diagnosed with a dependent personality disorder, depression, and anxiety.>! I have attempted suicide on multiple occasions but failed. My family makes me want to kill myself everyday.!<

The abuse is very apparent everyday, and I swore to the day I turned 18, I will move out. My mother has taken my legal documents, (which I have on me again temporarily, I used university applications as an excuse for her to give it to me.) My bank account is legally still bounded to my mother so any transactions I make, she can see. If I try to do anything with it, she will beat the life out of me.

My sister doesn't help. She would do everything to snitch on any attempt she catches me that is against my parents' house rules. I don't even see her as my own sister anymore.

I've considered moving out of the country just to cut all contacts with them.

I don't have any jobs that pays, but I want to so I could be able to financially help myself. I want to move out to a safer place. Someone, please, help me. I don't have anyone to turn to.

With my utmost sincerity, and wholeheartedly, want to let you know that I appreciate each, and every single one of you. I have teared up and even sobbed because I'm quite a stranger to this act of kindness as I was deprived of this growing up. 

I used to think that living life was impossible for someone like me, pero naiintindihan ko rin na it will get better as long as I try to keep fighting and finding better ways to cope. It's really hard to live in the same house of your abusers, hence why I am trying to leave. I will take all of your advice that are logical, safe, and ensured to put me in a better place.

Rant: Romanticizing abuse in wattpad books.,"I was 12 or 13 years old when I first started my wattpad journey.  I admitted I was into this type of novels na kung saan ung bad boy na inlove sa good girl, ito ang karamihan na kinakikiligan lagi ng mga kabataan. Ang  disturbing pa ay tumaas ang kanilang ""standard"" kuno sa mga lalaki pero nung binasa ko ang book ng character nila eh puro nalang egoism, emotional abuse and physical abuse ang pinoportray ng character. Minsan makakabasa ka rin ng stockholm and lima syndrome.  Ang mas malala mga babae pa ang nagsusulat ng mga ganitong novels.

Napaka talamak ng ganitong stories in this age na pinaglalaban natin ang equality and respect sa bawat isa.

Why do Westerners find the concept of having house help a little inhumane?,"TLDR:
I think foreigners’ finding the concept of househelp inhumane is ethnocentric and a little strange.

I’m open to having my mind changed though.

—

For context, I saw a clip of Anthony Bourdain talking and calling out some Singaporeans who say they don’t know how to do laundry because they’re used to having house help and the comments were eating it up, calling them privileged, spoiled brats.

Many of the comments were calling them babies and needing to be taken down a notch.

Bourdain (half jokingly) calls them out of touch bourgeois, working class abusers ( as in abuses the working class, not literal legal abusing.)

This is a sentiment I often heae from Westerners. They feel deeply uncomfortable at the thought of hiring help for the kids or home.

I, despite having a privileged background, grew up without a maid so I know how to do literally all house chores, with maybe the exception of ironing. Well, I know how to, I’m just not good at it.

Despite this, I never found issue with my friends having maids. In my mind, it’s employing people to do a job.  You pay them the same way you pay the housekeepers at a hotel.

I don’t understand why many Westerners find the practice abhorrent and medieval.

Of course, abused help (sexually, physically, verbally) is terrible and is a different story, but I mean literally paying someone to do a service seems pretty straightforward.

We even call them “kasambahay” like “people who have the same home.” And for many of my friends’ maids they call my friends their “alaga.”

Even in media like Jody Sta Maria’s“Be Careful with My Heart”, the house help (several) and the family driver are shown as characters who work for Richard Yap and have a healthy working relationship. Jody Sta Maria’s character witholding 😅

Edit: since some people are bringing up uniforms, I have a very uncommon view on this. I’m actually pro-uniform. Nothing degrading or caricature-esque, just like a polo shirt or whatever.

As someone who employs people for my business, they were SO happy when I asked them if they wanted us to make a uniform they could wear.

They said it made them feel like part of the team.

When I worked corporate, I also liked wearing company shirts. Idk maybe I have a weird perspective, I feel like I look professional / respectable when I’m in “work attire.” (Usually a polo shirt with a logo)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/188tlok/why_do_westerners_find_the_concept_of_having/,t2_782ciygg,2023-12-02 10:40:38,184
Jessica Soho should be ashamed of glamorizing dating AFAMs as a means to get out of poverty,"I recently came across a clip from the official KMJS TikTok page where they were talking about women who are with white men and how that has helped them better their lives financially. The clip ended with a relative talking about how their house was better because someone in their family married an Australian man. What respectable journalist glamorizes the exploitation of their own people like that? Media like this is why it’s so easy for our people to get trafficked. We are constantly being subconsciously encouraged to think that leaving the Philippines will solve all our problems, instead of bettering our society. They don’t talk about how abusive those men can be once the women move countries or what their lives actually look like in a new place. Shameful honestly.





EDIT: Some people seem to be intentionally missing the point that the issue isn’t interracial relationships, but encouraging women to go for a foreign man instead of encouraging our women to better themselves so they can support themselves. Fully relying on another person for your every need will put you in a tough spot the moment that person decides they no longer want to support you. You will be stuck in an abusive situation if you don’t have the financial means to leave and support yourself. This is important especially when you think about those women being brought to a whole new country where they have to rely on the partner for everything from housing to going out due to a language barrier. Imagine how isolating it must be to do that, and that’s only if the man continues to be good to you. One day the man can wake up and decide that he no longer wants you around and turn that anger and frustration to physical violence.  It also makes Filipino men look incompetent to raise families, because it boils the marriage down to a financial transaction. Of course money matters in a marriage, which is why both sides should be bringing something to the table. It starts the marriage off at an equal footing. Accepting and encouraging that women should just be gold diggers gives our country and our people a terrible impression internationally. There are many Filipinos who work hard for their money, only to get lumped in with that stereotype. 

As for Jessica Soho’s lack of integrity as a journalist, as I had mentioned previously, it’s shameful. She is well aware of the importance the media plays in society and how it can negatively impact us. Putting her name on a show like that also means she has creative freedom and the power to choose what stories are worth sharing.

I am a member of Iglesia Ni Cristo and I find this as a cult.,"
I hope people will catch this post. Hi, I’m in my 20’s and I’ve been a member of the INC since 2016. I will give you some background details on how I converted to INC. 

My Dad is born INC while my Mom is born catholic. When they got married my Dad got removed or kicked out for being an INC but still attends worship services.

I do remember that I never attended masses or worship services when I was a kid, my Dad work abroad while my mom takes care of me. I did attend several worship service in INC during late 2010’s because my dad came home for a vacation. Although when my Mom had to work abroad also and then mu dad has to go back abroad. I was left in the care of my catholic grandparents so I had my communion in catholic.

But in 2015 when my parents came home for vacation, they took me away from my grandparents and looked for a place to rent and they happened to find one where the landlord and his family are born INC so that’s where it all started. I was in my pre-teen so I was naive, like any other child who obeys their parents, I followed what my parents said but my mom never went to convert though, it was just me.

But as I grew up, that’s where I started to see that this is just a cult. So after years of attending their worship services this are some of the things I find bullshit.

- Having a relationship or getting married to someone who is not part of the religion. I find this bullshit, why? Why is this a rule? All of us are humans, so I don’t get it why you can’t be with someone just because you and your partner have different religions. 

- The religion was formed 1914, it’s not even in the 1500’s it’s still a baby despite over a hundred years later. I question myself, why was it formed in 1914? So it started as a small group, then it’s a cult. 

- They have in their ‘bible’ that Christ choose the INC, that they are the real ones and will only be saved. So if you’re not INC, you’re going to hell. This is BULLSHIT. They want the religion to be respected but they don’t respect other religions and people who are NOT INC. I remember one of the worship service they mentioned Catholic and I can still remember how they despised them and like they talked shit about them.

- The unity vote that happens every election. It was my first time voting last year and I knew they were gonna endorse BBM because they did endore Ferdinand back then. When one of the INC members found out I was not gonna vote who ever the leader is going to vote they threatened me to get removed (I would love to but what I am afraid is my dad, who’s a big INC)

- They guilt trip you, that if you leave the INC you will not be saved, blah blah blah.

- They want non-INC people to convert! I had people even my family to do some ‘akay’ even if the person doesn’t want to it’s like they still try to push their cult in them.

- They say these things to people who just got removed from the INC. Ministers will announce at the end of their mass people who got removed from the INC and the reason and will tell not to accept them in their homes or talk to them (it’s like they threat them some kind of an animal)

- I had one mass before that talked about depression and anxiety and they said to pray and attend worship services. I was also depressed once and one of the INC members visited me at home and told them the reason and he said “You should always come to the worship services as God will help you get through that” HOW CAN A RELIGION OR A GOD HELP MY MENTAL ILLNESS

- One of their teaching is that you should never put worship services or INC second. Like if you have work or something urgent as the same day you have the mass, they said that is ‘that’ more important than God? 

Additionally, I am in a relationship with someone who is not INC and my partner doesn’t want to convert. My family knew about that my partner is not INC, my mom doesn’t have a problem or likely she never said anything but last month I argued with my dad. He said that if he doesn’t want to convert, I should leave my partner. He said that there are other tons of people for me.

I find that bullshit. This partner I have has been the sweetest and caring person. My partner respects me and supports me in every way. My dad wants me to have someone who’s also INC. My dad doesn’t want to meet my partner because of the religion issue. It’s funny that he’s a pure and born INC but he cheated on my mom multiple times and physically abused my mom before. Keep in mind that’s also in their rule, never have an affair to your partner and never physically abuse your partner. The hypocrisy.

I will leave this religion one day, once I am fully independent. NEVER CONVERT IN THIS RELIGION.

Edit: I know what I said is disrespectful for the actual believers of the INC. I used to respect the religion. I try to respect every religion and people whatever their beliefs are. But if you have to push your religion onto someone, say some things bad about other religions and other people, then do I really need to give respect to someone or something that doesn’t know respect? Keep in mind, it’s a human rights to pick your own religion and beliefs. Walang masama to worship and be in a different religion as long as wala ka naman tinatapakan na kapwa tao. We’re all humans, with differences but still humans. Same start, ipapanganak ka and same ending, you’ll die.

Edit: For people saying na bakit hindi na lang ako umalis or mag change ng religion. Yes, di naman mahirap umalis sa INC, I just can’t leave kasi naka puder ako sa magulang ko and dependent pa ako sa kanila. Sobrang istrikto ng magulang ko na kahit sabihin ko na hindi lang ako makakasamba ng isang araw magagalit na sila kung ano ano na ang sasabihin. Oo pwede ako umalis pero maniwala kayo o hindi sobrang complicated kaya balak kong tiisin at intayin na ako ay fully independent na.

Another edit: So, just to clarify things. My post is one sided, obviously. Because I am talking about my experience, why I see it as a cult and things I find bullshit. Some people have good points why it’s a rule some say it’s not only INC. I KNOW THAT, I know it’s not only INC, I know not only INC have the cult like. But I am talking about INC here not JW, not Mormons, not Islam, not Catholics, not Christianity etc. Yes INC did some good things like charity events or other helping hand events. But I didn’t mention those because again my post is one sided and I am only here to talk about THESE. It is my opinion and my point of view. It is my own feelings and point of view yet again I am open to see more other side but I am firm with my point of view.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/18bb5ox/i_am_a_member_of_iglesia_ni_cristo_and_i_find/,t2_p5fyopoj,2023-12-05 20:43:18,1518

How my family got tangled in a broken system,"Growing up, my life was defined by the typical dynamic of an OFW (Overseas Filipino Worker) family. My father, working abroad, was a hero in my young eyes, providing for us from a distance. This image crumbled when, at 9, I stumbled upon his secret family and multiple affairs while playing a game on his Facebook account. This revelation marked the start of my battle with social anxiety and trust issues.

Life took a harsher turn in my teenage years. My father lost his job due to illness, compelling my mother to become an OFW in Taiwan. At 15, I found myself in a reversed role, taking care of my younger brother and managing household duties while dealing with the pressures of school. Meanwhile, my father's paranoia escalated, leading to unfounded accusations against my mother and financial neglect.

The pandemic intensified our struggles, trapping us with an increasingly abusive father. Our home became a battleground of mental and physical turmoil, pushing me to the brink of despair.

In desperation, we turned to local authorities for help, but our pleas were dismissed, overshadowing our suffering with the frail image of my so called father.

Fast forward to today, my mother has returned, and we've managed to leave our abusive household. However, the scars remain. We discovered that my father committed bigamy. My dad was already married before he married my mom. My mom did not know anything about this of course. He had also sold our family home, leaving us in debt and without support. He has since cut all ties with us.

I'm sharing this story on r/Philippines not just to unburden but to connect with others who might understand this journey. We're still seeking justice and healing. It makes me wonder about the many silent stories like ours, where families grapple with unseen struggles and injustices. In a society where family is everything, where do we stand when those family ties are the ones that hurt us the most?

In the midst of these personal battles, I can't help but ask – where do we find justice in our own corners in the Philippines? How do we navigate a system that often overlooks the silent sufferings of families like mine? I guess I'm looking for answers, or maybe just a bit of understanding and solidarity from those who've walked a similar path.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/180ge6c/how_my_family_got_tangled_in_a_broken_system/,t2_fa85jv7r,2023-11-21 20:58:02,582
I wanna kill my Uncle,"My uncle ( who has physically and mentally abused me in my early childhood consisting of choking me when i was as little as 8 ) keeps bugging me and asserting his dominance even though he has no job and no title at all, my grandmother pays all the monthly bills and he still acts like he owns the fuckin place all the time.He has 4  children that he constantly physically abuse, My mom and aunts have been thinking weather or not to report this to the police but every time he does it we just let it go because they don't want to face the reality that their brother is a fuckin child beater.

I don't know how to report it anonymously, I can't go to stations to report it either, I tried contacting Facebook groups but they don't respond.Also, I have evidence on him beating his child, but it doesn't show him beating them, it shows him after beating them.I really don't know what to do at this point and If all fails, I will have to kill him with my own hands.I have thought of this for a long time and I just might do it, I am tired of the abuse, I am tired of seeing his children getting abused.

The Philippines is mostly Pro-Lesbian but Anti-Gay,"This is not a hate post.

I haven't heard of a story, past nor present, that a Lesbian Filipina suffered from physical nor emotional abuse from homophobic parents, peers and colleagues, but there's plenty of horrifying stories of what Filipino Gay Men have to suffer under the brutality of their parents and colleagues just because they're gay.

Teaching Forgiveness to Humanity has become license to neglect justice and accuse victims that they are evil and cannot forgive,"(English na lang para Filipino and English speaking netizens ccn participate)

Good day Reddit,

I am going through some personal problem specifically about seeking justice to someone I have loved in my life, my parent.

I always pray to God for justice and healing. I never pray good to my wicked parent except for true repentance that before she/he die he/she will come to me and help me in my sickness that was result of family abuse and bring justice for me.

When I read the Bible, I knew in my heart something is wrong about forgiveness and honoring parents, and loving your enemies and never put hatred in your heart.

But why when I talk to people they will mock you because of seeking justice and accuse you have wicked heart.

But having physical trauma that is deadly is hard to fight.

That is the reason I do not want to go to church and judge them also and our society that they ate evil and do not care about victims of abuse.

But I still believe in God but I doubt about the accuracy of Bible about justice and forgiveness. What is the victim is about to die and was suffering and he do not want hatred in his heart but healing and justice and no one believe that his heart is honest?

I am just confused. Many people are victims of injustices and yet no church nor Christians nor honest leader take care of them.

Hope some will have sympathy on these topics not only for me but also to others victims of injustices.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/18qlt6s/teaching_forgiveness_to_humanity_has_become/,t2_6gecwuic1,2023-12-26 00:28:56,9
What steps to take to formally file complaint against abusive relatives living in the same house?,"(Long post ahead! But please, take the time to read. I'd like to ask for help.)

Hello. I am an 18 year old college freshman with two younger siblings, 14F and 11M. As the title says, I'm looking for a way to formally file a complaint against our relatives, an aunt and her son (our cousin), which currently live in the same small house as ours.

As you can imagine, madaming tension. It's very rare to find a day of peace, lalo na when the extended family also lives in the same compound and are equally squammy warfreaks. 

My main cause of concern for filing a complaint is that I have no idea how to take the first steps. This is my first year being 18 and I don't even have any useable valid gov IDs as of the moment. I'm also not well-equipped to travel in the case of having to file complaints physically due to financial restraints and my limited knowledge of commuting. I just fear for the worst for me and my siblings.

Some background to all of this: 
Every day we are trapped in this house, we aren't treated like humans. Worst of all, father nalang namin kasama namin sa bahay, and he doesn't know or even dare to defend us, either, in all the years na nagdudusa kami dito. The main argument of all our toxic relatives is ""Edi sana sumama nalang kayo sa nanay niyo."" Like it was that easy, when she's living with the family of her current boyfriend (where the BF knows we exist, but his family does not, let alone know that my mother has an existing marriage she turned her back on). In short, oo, the entire family (father's side) is toxic, the classic filipino family tree that looks more like a cesspool than a ""family"", na may away sa lupa, and anything under the sun.
 
Me and my siblings are also viewed as ""perwisyo"", and worse than just garbage for simply existing, kase pinapahirapan pa daw namin ang lola namin since iniwan kami ng mother namin here when she left. This impression of me and my siblings existed as far back as when I was a toddler, where even as a young child they would call me ""abnormal"", or ""autistic"", ableist, disgusting names that a child should never be called, most especially in the most degrading way possible. We suffer the brunt of this abuse in the hands of our own aunt, cousin, and aforementioned lola. 

To recall some of the things we've endured while growing up (besides the name calling), we've always been verbally and emotionally abused, na kahit bata pa kami nasasabihan na kami na ""Lasunin niyo nalang 'yang mga yan, total perwisyo lang dito sa bahay"". My memory fails to surface the more repressed memories, but name-calling, belittling, and the occassional physical abuse have always been a key part of our childhood here. 

More recently, they have continued this harassment in more ways. Nagkaroon ng isa pang anak ang aunt namin, and he's currently a toddler. He's being taught constantly to call us names (eg. autistic/auti, bobo) instead of using our real names, and has followed in the footsteps of his older brother and mother. There has also been two instances so far where we left our shared bed unattended and it suddenly had been sprinkled with white sugar all over (likely an attempt to have pests and insects bite us). For it to happen twice is no coincidence, but my lola always turns a blind eye to it.

My lola is included in the list of perpetrators because, in simple words, kunsintidor siya. She lets them teach the toddler derogatory words, she doesn't believe us when we say our bed was sprinkled with sugar, and she doesn't bat an eye, or say anything when we are called names, verbally abused or even hit with a snide side comment when we aren't even doing anything except for existing. 

Just tonight, an hour before writing this post, me and my siblings came home to our shoes and slippers missing. We found it some time later, when we saw that they were scattered across our bed. Maybe that was the breaking point, and I had lashed out at my grandmother — to do something, say something, speak to them, before I let myself do something bad to them. She had the audacity to say ""tama na"" and call me a doña for wanting her to stop tolerating and defending her abusive daughter and grandson. I would understand simple favoritism, but to turn a blind eye to all this for so many years, you honestly can't use ""Eh 'yung mga kalokohan mo nga kinukunsinte ko din"", when we don't sprinkle sugar on their beds and purposefully trash our property when it inconveniently gets in their way. 

I have no idea where to begin to start change in this household we have no choice but to survive in, and it's even harder when no one in the family is on our side. Me and my siblings are not perfect and we are not saints, we are young and rebellious to a degree, yes — but that doesn't warrant them treating us like nasty pests all our lives when we didn't ask for it.

I will answer any relevant questions if this post gains traction. I just really need help right now, thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/18uiy8g/what_steps_to_take_to_formally_file_complaint/,t2_2nq2o6p3,2023-12-31 00:09:47,18

Grounds to file a restraining order against a parent?,"Meron bang judge sa Philippines that would find merit in granting a restraining order filed by an adult child vs a parent?

Suppose the child actually has a diagnosed health problem wherein a physician recommends staying away from stress and any stressors to prevent worsening of the illness. Suppose the cause of stress is also seconded by years of sessions with both a psychiatrist and a psychologist. In this case, the mother is the constant stressor throughout the child's life.

Issues:
- no physical abuse during childhood
- very high on emotional abuse and neglect
- physical and financial needs met (that's why she gets away with it)
- mother denies adult child's mental health problems
- when adult child applied for a Psychosocial PWD ID (with doctor's endorsement), mother just asked ""di mo talagang kayang icontrol na lang?"" In fear na it will be known sa Munisipyo staff na gagawa ng ID.
- child has a current diagnosis wherein medication is needed daily
- child developed poor eating habits due to constant nagging during mealtimes growing up.
- adult child calls out mother's behavior every time and how she can do better but she gets mad and doesn't listen
- at the same time, she asks where she went wrong pero walang balak magbago
- child is undergoing possible screening for undiagnosed autism in adults so child actually experiences an adult version of a tantrum and mother's response is to yell back
- pretty much every solution is to yell back at the child (despite husband's constant advise not to yell at child during a tantrum)
- friends and family always excuse her by saying ""ganyan talaga yan""
- mother is panganay among panganays so nobody actually stands up to her
- husband is deceased so nobody can tell her how to parent

Apart from just cutting ties with the mother, it helps to prove a point with a restraining order in place because all attempts to tell her what she doing wrong to give a chance to change doesn't work.

Is there merit to a judge granting a restraining order filed by an adult child vs a parent?

Mother is a senior but has many other relatives at home to care for her so she's not really at home if her only child leaves and goes no-contact.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/14f0itz/grounds_to_file_a_restraining_order_against_a/,t2_tluexage,2023-06-21 15:16:01,0

Tangina kahit ikwento mo talambuhay mo babasahin ko yan para lang malaman at maintindihan ko kung pano nagwowork ang healthy fam.

Don't get me wrong, I know healthy families and good parents exist here. But I can't imagine talaga kung pano sila... Umasta? It's easier to imagine abusive families because that's what I know.

May nakakaalam ba ng title ng indie movie na to?,"I watched an indie movie back in a film-showing we had at my college from local small directors. It was a post-apocalyptic short film entirely shot in a dingy room where a father's chained to a corner and his daughter comes in to hand him some food because it's his birthday. The dad' sort of pissed because his daughter's kind of teasing him about his miserable and it's heavily implied that she had to restrain him because he was physically abusive. It's even hinted that he was sexually abusing her (his own UNDERAGE DAUGHTER) when she does an erotic dance to torment him to send a message of ""you can't get this, it's just out of reach"". Dad can't take it anymore and kills himself (I forgot how) then the camera pans to some keys and it's revealed that the girl was going to free him as his ""birthday gift"".

[Serious] Im planning to ruin the rapist's reputation in our family. Need advice kung i-push ko pa ito or should I just save myself from all the trouble.,"TW: marital rape, verbal and physical abuse
BG story: I currently know na rapist tatay ko kasi sinabi ng mom ko. This is the only proof I have so far but it's not that hard to believe considering these events:
1) my dad is physically abusive, hitting us until we have bruises
2) also verbally abusive, walang araw na hindi lilipas na wala siyang sisigawan at mumurahin
3) isolated my mom from all her relatives and friends
4) if you f*ck up in public, he'd see this as an oppurtinity to make a public stunt to shout and berate you (no family member is exempted from this)
5) lantaran na cheating, whether yung katulong or pinsan niya (yes, i know kadiri)
6) also isolating us siblings from my mother's sides relatives (bc he feels inferior since thay are all doing better than him)

What I'm currently doing right now is recording his outbursts. Also, working on financial stability to get out of the house but not enough to get my mom and siblings. Alam ko na medyo malayo na magkaroon ng hustisya even though mag testify mom and siblings ko. So I want to tarnish his reputation one way or another (of course I'd have to ask my mom and siblings consent before releasing any evidence). Or possibly used for blackmail since he values his reputation so much. I'm not going down without taking him with me if ever my mental illness takes me, that's the endgame probably.

Anyway, also wondering if ever my naging rapist or abusive POS sa pamilya niyo. How was this information received on both sides of the family (father and mother side)? May HIMpathy ba or did the victim receive any justice?

Posting this because kumukulo dugo ko everytime natatandaan ko mga kagaguhan na ginawa niya.

EDIT: Thank you to everyone who replied. In all honesty, takot ako na sabihin lahat ng nangyari sa amin in real life with other people because they might not believe my family went through something like this. It seems that the best and responsible option is to contact and inform authority figures and that's what I'll do for now. I'd also reconnect with my mom's relatives (we were estranged by my father from them) and tell them our story and hope they'd believe it. I will also look into protection orders and see if that might work. Since we can't leave this house (or rather he leaves) we'd just have to watch and avoid him. 

Yes I do believe he's a sociopath. Probably scarred din siya sa childhood niya because he'd vent most days and I'd pity him. However, the violence he has directed towards us is unjustifiable and I'd be happy to see him rot away alone and unloved. 

I also don't know kung bakit ngayon ko lang naisipan gumanti sa kanya or find justice throughout it all. I guess umasa ako dati na baka magbago siya but it only got worse and it never stopped. Enough is enough I suppose.

Toxic/abusive Chinese school tutors somewhere in Manila,"Hi  
I used to go to a Filipino-Chinese Catholic school here sa Pinas. My parents wanted me to attend the school kasi “maganda daw yung reputation” or yung quality ng education or something. I already got out of that school years ago, but when me and my sister were talking about our childhood memories, we only realized how fucked up our elementary school years were. For one, we realized how badly we were treated as students in that school. We experienced a lot of racism from our classmates since everyone had Chinese blood, and us, having no mix of Chinese blood, we stood out in terms of physical appearance and not being able to properly understand Chinese like all of our classmates. We were bullied for having relatively dark skin and for not being able to understand Chinese, and I even remember my Chinese teachers getting mad at me for having low grades in my Chinese subjects simply because i am not Chinese. 

I also remember having to go to tutor lessons after class for both my Chinese lessons and my non-Chinese lessons. My routine would consist of waking up everyday at 5 am, leaving school at 4 pm to go to our tutor lessons and get home at 10 pm after getting shit done. I even remember coming home at 11 pm once because we were having a difficult time at this one particular subject. Needless to say I was burnt out in my years staying in that school, but it also doesn’t end there. 

So most of my elementary days, I had tutor lessons in this building that’s a few minutes walk away from my school. During the day, it’s a daycare center, but somewhere around the evening it becomes a tutoring space. In my experience, most of the tutors I had were relative old. Around 50-70 years old, and we usually had separate tutors for certain subjects, for exampls: We had one tutor for Math and Science, another for AP and Fil, then another for our Chinese subjects. I remember all of them being equally bad and abusive. I also only now realize that I grew up in this environment where the teachers are just like bullies and I probably got unresolved trauma from them.

I remember that one of my tutors being the most feared one. Let’s call her Mrs. F. Mrs. F tutored us for our Filipino subjects, but she also handled most of the highschool students in the tutoring place. She was always feared for being “strict” which I now realize is actually her being very verbally abusive. I also recall times where she was physically abusive because she sometimes slapped the students on the arm/ shoulders(?), or like yung mannerism niya everytime she gets angry is scary because it always looked like she was about to hit you. She always slammed on the table, and I remember one time when she got really mad and threw a plastic chair across the room and it almost hit my classmate.

I remember my tutors yelling at the students, like verbally abusing them and sometimes calling us names, or would curse us out for not getting certain questions right, or them kicking us out tuwing napupuno na sila.

Abuse as a grounds for annulment,"Hi everyone. I made this account so I could ask a question.

Is abuse (verbal, emotional, psychological, minimal physical but with threats of harm) grounds for annulment?

I'm a married man, and the pandemic has shown my wife's true colors. She barely does anything with regard to the house's upkeep. I always do the cooking, cleaning, paying the bills, going down for deliveries, etc.; basically the physical work. Whatever she needs I always try my best to provide. 

I guess as the man of the house these are my responsibilities, but whenever I make a mistake, whether minor or major, I am severely berated and insulted. I've been called stupid, useless, and everything in between. I've had bottles thrown at me, been threatened with violence, and have been hit, most times are just strong slaps on my shoulder, but there was this one time she hit me really hard on the back head, open palmed. 

I also have a lot of responsibilities at work, and she doesnt seem to recognize that. There are times that I needed to excuse myself from meetings, file emergency leaves just to attend to her needs.

I'm not sure what to do with my situation. I have pointed out her lack of patience a several times and it doesnt change. I can be forgetful yes, but I'm literally doing so many things. How am I expected to remember every little detail. 

Is this abuse? Am I in an abusive relationship? I'm not sure really. I make mistakes but do I deserve to be berated and insulted, and even hit? All I ever did to react was raise my voice, and she even uses that against me. I've been googling about annulment in here, the process is complicated and expensive, but if the above can be grounds for it, I'll make the investment. 

I really need help on this one. If there are communities online for this kind of thing, or organizations I can turn to for help, please do let me know. Thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/k90vcl/abuse_as_a_grounds_for_annulment/,t2_97z0uooi,2020-12-08 16:52:58,16
Runaway in Need of Advice," Hi! I've never use reddit before but I came here because I need advice. I've also posted on r/runaway

So,  both of my parents have a history of physical abuse, especially when I  entered Pisay. They found my grades and behavior unsatisfactory. It  stopped with the pandemic and because my brother's gf lived with us but  she got assigned to a location on another island. My parents have  threatened physical violence in that time but tonight, my father hit me  again for the first time in over a year. Before that I was planning to  wait another year before I run away but I'm scared of what will happen  if I do.

I have done surface  research into cheap apartments and possible sources of income (since I'm  probably not gonna get my diploma). I am not a minor and I have access  to my birth certificate. I was also signed up for a Natl ID in July-Aug  but it still hasn't arrived. I have about 50k of my stipend saved up and  a friend who lives near the place that I plan to go. My brother's gf is  nice but I don't want to risk her—or any other adult I know—telling my  parents.

I don't plan to run away immediately. Maybe 2 weeks-1 month so I can possibly collect some more money from sketch commissions.

If  anyone has advice (esp like resources for learning how to adult (taxes,  doctors, etc.), legal stuff, jobs that don't require diplomas,  shelter), it would be much appreciated 😊",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/sp5uyn/runaway_in_need_of_advice/,t2_dqbaqx07,2022-02-10 20:49:02,1

Anyone got any good psychotheraphy and marriage counseling here in Manila?,"Context: My parents are in the verge of extreme mental exhaustion and toxicity mula nang magpa counseling sa church nila.

Can anyone help me out san best dalhin to? Alam ko sa kulungan para sa step father ko for being too manipulative but that is an option for another time. I have 3 very lovely sisters and I don't want them to experience ang mga naranasan ko nung bata pa ako with my psychopath father.

Can you legally change your surname due to family estrangement?,"My friend recently cut himself off from his family after enduring more than 2 decades of constant abuse (mental, emotional, and physical).

He's decided to start a completely new chapter of his life without them, and even went so far as to proclaim that he doesn't recognize his parents as his parents anymore.

He wants to change his surname to reflect this change, as he doesn't want to have any more ties holding him to his former family.

Is this legally possible in the Philippines? Has anyone done this and can share the experience?

PS. please don't suggest trying to mend things with his family, or going to counseling or therapy. They've tried that multiple times over the years already. It didn't work for them, and even after trying so hard to mend things with his family, he still ended up bruised and bleeding ,sometimes with broken body parts (I say body parts and not bones because his father actually damaged his eye already), c/o his father and/or mother.

Battered Husband here. Where to get help?,"Verbal abuse.  Calling me tanga, bobo and other similar insults.  Often compares me to her father and other men.  Criticizes a lot of things from my driving, my lack of ""diskarte"" to my speed in doing household chores.  Accuses me of cheating even though I am faithful.

Psychological - violently hitting my PC, hiding my gaming consoles and handhelds

Physical.  Threw a toy at me which gave a small wound on my lower chin.  Slapping, punching me in the chest(to the point I cannot breathe) and arms, pushing.  Aside from the wound to the chin, I have not sustained any other visible injuries.

Immediate effects I note are a ""fear"" of screwing things up and losing the desire to have sex(which leads to more episodes of abuse).  There are probably other subconscious effects that I have not taken note of.

I will admit that I am immature, lazy, irresponsible and have failed to provide for the family.  I was fired from my recent job.  We run a business together but I am not as personally invested into it as her, which is usually the cause of our ""episodes"".  We are both gamers but I tend to take it more seriously than her.  I am at fault as well and I often struggle with whether what she is doing is justified and if I were to ""fix myself"" then things would be better.

She is not always like this and is usually quick to forgive.  We make up in a couple of hours.  85% of the time she is loving and caring.  

I have not told anyone.  This post is my first attempt for help.

I know the situation here in our country on how men are perceived but I would like to ask where I can get help.  If there is a hotline or group that I can get in contact with that will not discriminate, it would be very helpful.

Toxic Family Members ,"Hi. I'm not sure what flair to use buuut

I just wanted to get some advice and to get this situation off my chest. 

So ayun na nga, my partner and I are planning to leave our house (kami lang ng father, mother, and partner ko ang naninirahan) na for good. 

The toxicity is prevalent. As in. Yung father ko kase, wala siyang work (for a decade) and umaasa sa panganay kong kapatid para sa panggastos sa bahay (food, etc. Yung bills ay shouldered namen ng mom ko). I'm still currently studying and mag iistart na ako sa new work ko next week. 

The thing is, yung father ko, yung allowance na dapat for house expenses na pinapadala sakanya ng kapatid ko is pinang iinom niya. Let's say naubos na yung pinadala in a span of 3 days, tatawag siya ulet and the cycle goes on every week. 

I'll come out clean and say na there are times that me and my dad banter to the point that we raise our voices. But, that is only because he was drunk. On days that he wasn't, we're chill. The house is quiet. 

Triny ko sabihin sa kapatid ko however ang sinasabi niya lang lagi is ""wag pakealaman"" or ""hayaan lang"" and ilock yung gate. 

To the point na, today, napalayas siya ng mom ko kase muntikan niya na masunog yung bahay kase naiwan niya yung kalan and yung niluluto niya due to uminom siya kaninang umaga. 

Take note, galing sila sa place ng kapatid ko noong Saturday and uminom na siya doon, kagabi nung umuwi sila, uminom ulet, and then kaninang morning is uminom after my mom left for work and my partner and I went to school. 

Pag uwi ko after ng 1st class ko, since 4 hours naman vacant ko 'til my next class, nadatnan ko bahay namen na open ang gate, may nasusunog na niluto, amoy sunog yung bahay, and tulog yung father ko sala. 

Sinabi ko sa kapatid ko ang nangyare and then all they said is ""hayaan mo na, ilock mo na ang gate, at wag mong sasabihin kay mama yung nangyare"". I just said okay. 

Few hours have passed, umuwi na ang mom ko from work. Nadatnan niya dad ko na gising na, walking in his underwear and still intoxicated. Nakita niya yung nasunog na pan with the ulam in it. She asked me what happened and long story short, I told her kase she was so tired and I didn't had the heart to lie. 

My mom kicked my dad out and a few hours later, yung kapatid ko is nag chat saken stating na ano daw ang nangyare, bakit ko daw sinabi, and ako daw ang dahilan kung bakit napalayas ang dad ko. Making me the bad guy. Not making my dad accountable for his actions. 

I missed my classes kase kailangan ko bantayan yung bahay and my dad then this happens. 

My sibling threatened everything I own(including my cats e.g. will throw them away). So I decided and told my mom my partner and I will leave. She's okay with this.

Is this the right decision? I really want to pursue my studies without having to cut classes para lang sunduin ang father ko sa pinag iinuman niya just because hindi niya na kaya. I'm supposed to be at school from 8 in the morning to 9 in the evening since ayun yung sched ng classes ko. 

I tried running away from them before for physical abuse na earned me a brain damage pero wala eh, na gaslight ako. 

My sibling is very far away btw. Nasa province siya. 

Any advice? I don't have friends anymore to talk to about my situation kase they made me unfriend them.

Any thoughts and advice I will respect. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/1aur66q/toxic_family_members/,t2_dcyco2zil,2024-02-20 00:17:39,0

Entitled Filipino Relatives,"I just have to vent real quick about my mom’s situation. Not too long ago my mom told me that her brother posted something vile on her Facebook page. He said something along the lines of “are you not going to send money?” First of, it sounded so rude to demand money and post it on her page when this topic could’ve been dealt privately. First off, my mom didn’t have a good relationship with her mom and her brother growing up. Her mom neglected her and sent her to her grandparents. My mom’s brother was also very physically and emotionally abusive towards my mom. There were instances where my mom would get slapped in her teenage years. It was only after we moved to Canada where they suddenly cared about my mom so much. But in then end, they always demanded money. It’s not even just her brother but his entire family that demands money from my mom. Their reason is that my grandma’s old and she needs money. But we never really get updates about her visits at the doctor.However, we do see photos of their family going out, having parties just a couple of days after my mom sends money to the Philippines. I told my mom that the instant her mom neglected her that should’ve been an indication that she won’t be part of my mom’s life anymore. 

It’s been tough for my mom financially and emotionally because my Dad passed away a year ago. Yet, her brother never asks my mom how she is, all he cares about is her money.

EDIT: hello everyone, I just wanna say how thankful I am for all your kind words and pieces of advice. I had a conversation with my mom not too long ago and with your help, I convinced her to block her brother and his family. She still shows a bit of worry towards her mom but I think an insurance would be a better option for her than sending money directly to them. So thank you! I hope you all have a lovely day/ night!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/rt8ayh/entitled_filipino_relatives/,t2_glgujcz2,2022-01-01 09:27:02,307

Edit: I'm aware that I'll be leaving a lot of stuff behind. My family will probably cut me off after this and I won't get any of my father's inheritance and I can say goodbye to other relatives.

Please give me advices/tips & information on living in Manila city for someone who wants to move out of toxic place in province..😔🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻,"A story first about me...I'm living from a province here in the Philippines and I want to be independent and move out from my family. My parents are both narcissistic and always wants me to follow their stupid beliefs and hypocrites without allowing me to have my own personality and make my OWN decisions. Like if I don't believe in their religion I'm automatically ""evil"" or tells me I should be cursed when I don't obey.

I have two older siblings but they both have a cold personality and sometimes says hurtful words. Sometimes I kinda understand why they're like that it's because of our parents unrealistic expectations and abuse towards us. But we're like strangers at home. We don't eat together and they don't even know or remember my birthday.. :'( What I can't stand from my parents is that they keep manipulating me and control my life especially on what I should wear, what kind of friends should I have etc. They're nosy about my life and doesn't understand boundaries.

My dad physically hurts me but most of the time I am lucky to be able to escape in a room. I couldn't report him because he had a stroke last year (just when I was about to report him)...He's kind of mentally challenged too that's why sometimes the cause of trigger of his anger is from himself since he's becoming sensitive of stupid reasons like not listening to him.

I don't have any relatives I'm close to or can rely on because we're always a competition to each other due to my aunties and uncles ( both mom and dad sides) obsession for bragging about rewards,honors etc.

Due to the circumstances at home I even suffered from low self esteem, depression and became introverted as I grow older which resulted to being BULLIED at school from high school till college, got harassed by my neighbors as well and even at my former work I got harassed by my boss by making me overwork without rest so I quit. I keep attracting bad situations and wrong people in my life here in the province. Which resulted to having extreme social anxiety where I became too scared to even go out of my home. Those bad memories were traumatic for me to make new friends and trust people.

Right now I work at home. I try to improve myself and go out on rare occasions but I know too well that staying in the province is no longer good for me and is deteriorating for my mental health.

I wanna move out to Manila but every time I say this to my friends they tell me that my own parents might call the police and find me. I don't believe them because asking for permission to my parents to leave the house is like asking them to tie me with a leash so that they can still control me when I'm far and they could stop me from leaving. I'm very sure my parents will not allow me to move out because they want me and my siblings to forever stay by their side to be manipulated.

If there's anyone who left their abusive family please tell me if you actually asked for your parent's permission or left discreetly? Also how did you cut off your abusive family?

I also wanna know how's the living costs in Manila like aside from renting please give me insights about how much do I need to save to live there permanently? And ANY INFORMATIONS please about places in Manila. And which places are good for renting apartment?

I want to cut off my family and this place for good because staying here longer is causing me more harm already.  The people here are just too toxic </3 If you're curious why Manila? Because I'm kinda familiar there and my dream company to work at is there! I'm not saying I'll move out asap. I'm planning to move out when I have enough expenses. I just need information and help from people here in reddit.

Help. Need legal advice.,"Hello everyone. I badly need legal advice. 

My aunt recently went through my things, read my journal, and took pictures of it. She also made PHYSICAL COPIES and distributed it to our employees. She says she’ll file a case against me because of what I wrote about her. 

Is there anything I can do to stop her from distributing the pictures she took? 

I want to prevent her from spreading this in the future. I’m afraid she’ll post it online, there was one entry about how I was sexually abused in school.

My parents told me that confronting her is enough and I don’t need to file a case because it is so tedious but I’m afraid she will spread it. Is there something like a police report or a cease and desist?

Raffy tulfo is the peak of all filipino toxic mentality,"Tulfo's show revolves around bombarding one party with threats, embarrassing them publicly, and encouraging netizens to attack them. In some cases, it is understood that this is a good method if its rich vs. poor, or the other party is someone who is in power. 

However, there is still a proper forum and venue for every complaints. Even he knows this, because he refers family fights to their respective barangays, but not before judging and concluding for himself who's right and wrong, humiliating the person he deemed wrong,  then claiming he's being fair because he lets them talk (only with too much interruption from him saying they're wrong). As if this is still not enough humiliation already, netizens will also say a lot of bad things to that party, even causing one guest to commit suicide. 

Family issues should also be communicated within the family, especially if its between parents and children. Tulfo, however, always sides with the parents, barely listening to the children's side, and emphasizes things like utang-na-loob and blind consideration because ""whatever happens, that is still your parent"". He encourages the mentality of making your kids an insurance policy. It doesn't matter if you can't afford it, it's okay to have ten kids, after all once you're done with the eldest, he/she is the one who's going to shoulder all the responsibilities for the other nine. If you don't give something to your parents (whatever valid reason you may have), you will be labeled as a bad son/daughter, when in the first place, giving should be something out of love, not obligation. 

Another toxic mentality he encourages is keeping a family whole even if its no longer healthy. If Party 1 cheated and Party 2 doesn't want to accept them anymore (perfectly understandable), Tulfo will conclude that Party 2 is the one destroying their family because ""even God forgives, why shouldnt you?"", and ""for the sake of the children"". Will it be healthier tho, for the children to see and hear their parents always fighting and not happy because they're forced to be together? The only abuse he sees is physical. If you're being abused mentally or emotionally, its as good as nonexistent. 

Tulfo's ""fairness"" also includes victim blaming. To be ""fair"" he's also going to enumerate the victim's ""katangahan"". You got molested by your friend? Then you shouldn't have worn skimpy shorts. You got molested by your boss? Maybe because you wanted to have the easy way out. He cheated on you? You must be a nagger, or maybe you don't give him what he wants. Being a victim means there is also something wrong with you too. It always ends with his line ""kita nyo ha, I'm just being fair here"". 

I appreciate Tulfo's help for the poor. Giving out personal help for those in need deserves a compliment. Let's not take it away from him. However, him being an almost perfect representation of a ""filipino boomer"" is far from being commendable. He may have the heart, but his sense of justice (attacking a person's dignity) is simply flawed. 

Tl;dr   Tulfo may have good intentions in helping, but his way of thinking is simply toxic, and sometimes bring more harm than good.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/e0e0mr/raffy_tulfo_is_the_peak_of_all_filipino_toxic/,t2_2r2fsulc,2019-11-23 14:11:48,286
skl para sa mga tulad ko na malungkot pero ayaw naman magkwento😅 post from CHR Ph,,https://i.redd.it/6dpb661nei891.jpg,t2_35pjv7qr,2022-06-29 15:04:34,94
Gusto ko na bumokod!,"Hello guys, gusto ko lang mag vent out and pasensya na rin if medyo magulo at mahaba ang kwento ko. 

My gf (26) and I (F25) really want to moved out na dito sa bahay ng family ko, reason is nahihirapan kami gumalaw suffocating na isa pa ang dugyut nila kasama sa bahay as in sobrang parang basurahan na yung bahay namin/junk shop andami pang daga at ipis, yung kwarto lang talaga namin yung malinis at maaliwas yung kapag labas mo ng kwarto parang nasa ibang lugar ka na kasi ibang iba talaga. 

Reason bakit sobrang gulo ng bahay namin kasi yung papa ko may pagka hoarder or kung tawagin ng mama ko sakim kasi gusto niya kanya lahat kahit walang pag gagamitan. Yung isang kwarto sa bahay puro kalat lang niya na ayaw niya itapon. One time nag uwi papa ko ng mga palaman lahat bawas na and alam mong pinag sawaan lang kaya binigay na pero inuwi pa din ng papa ko, may mga work naman kami may laman ref namin at pantry binibili din ng kuya ko mga needs niya pero di ko alam bat ganun tatay  ko. 

So going back, bukod sa madumi ambaho pa ng CR namin kasi yung papa ko di marunong mag buhos ng bowl after niya gamitin, madalas pa pati sarili niyang dumi di niya finaflash (wala namang dimentia or anything papa ko, nakaugalian niya lang. Sinanay kasi ng mama ko nung nagsasama pa sila na siya taga buhos, after gumamit ng tatay ko ng banyo susundan ng mama ko pag labas ng tatay ko para magflash). Nag dagdag pa siya ng pusa kung saan-saan din dumudumi kaya ang cause dumami langaw dito sa bahay. Pati mga pinag kainan nila papaabutin pa nila ng kuya ko ng ilang araw bago hugasan. 

Ilang beses na namin sinubukang linisin yung bahay or pang mukhaing bahay man lang, pero yung papa ko nagagalit lagi kesyo wag daw pakialaman mga gamit niya, kahit puro basura na tipong pati nangingitim at puro dumi na ng daga at ipis na tupperware ayaw pa ipatapon, yung ma damit na diniclutter namin para itapon na kinuha pa niya para ilagay dun sa isang kwarto para itambak lang. Kinausap na din namin tungkol sa pagflash bg bowl pero ""WALA"". Tumatandang paurong na lang. 

Nahihiya din ako sa GF ko minsan, kasi nga nag titiis din siya sa gantong sitwasyon. Sa mabaho at madumi naming bahay. 

Isa pang reason kaya gusto ko na lumaya sa bahay na 'to kasi sobrang dami kong trauma sa papa ko at bahay na to mismo. Verbal and Physical Abuse ang inabot ko sa tatay ko.

Gustong-gusto na namin umalis ng GF ko at bumukod, kasi di rin siya makagalaw ng maayos dito. Sobrang limited galaw niya dahil naiilang din siya sa papa ko at kuya ko. 

Ang problema? Natatakot ako. Kasi lagi na lang nila ginagamit yung ""Utang na Loob"". Natatakot ako na baka mag mukha akong walang kwentang anak at kapatid kasi maiiwan lahat ng responsibility sa kuya ko pag umalis ako/kami dito. Paulit-ulit kasi sinasabi sakin dati ng mama na malaki utang na loob namin kay kuya kasi nga di kami iniwan nung nakapag trabaho, na nag stay pa din kasama namin. Natatakot ako isipin nila na mayabang na ko, na aalis na ko porket kaya ko na. 

Gusto ng mama ko kung sakaling aalis ako sa bahay na to, isama ko kuya ko at pauwiin ang papa sa probisya nila, pero AYOKO. Madalas din akong i-guilt trip ng mama ko pag nag sasabi ako na gusto ko na bumukod. Pero ayoko din magmukhang walang utang na loob, natatakot din kasi ako baka sumama loob ng kuya ko sakin pag umalis kami at iwan siya. Pero gusto ko din ng tahimik at walang iniintindi na iba, gusto ko pribadong buhay kasama GF ko pero takot ako sa iisipin at sasabihin nila sakin.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/152c8qk/gusto_ko_na_bumokod/,t2_ektnzezq,2023-07-18 03:59:26,5

I plan to finally move out,"Hello, I'll be turning 23 and just graduated. I've been a working student and breadwinner throughout my college years. I've been shouldering all our expenses and everything at home, even my parent's leisure. Both of them are still physically fit to work and still in their 40s but because I can provide, they decided to rely on me for everything and even demand regular allowance. I'm also shouldering my younger sister's expenses and her education. She'll go to college this school year and because her college is far, she'll rent a dorm nearby so I will not need to worry about leaving her at home (my parents are abusive), I'm also thinking of using this chance to leave home and allowing my parents to take responsibility even for just themselves while they're still fit. 

I'm unsure if I should rent out first or get a place for myself. I have plans to go abroad but that's not sure yet and I might also continue medicine (so I'll be needing money to sustain my education). I have savings naman and earn an average of 50k/month. 

Renting:

Pros- Cheaper, I could leave easily if matuloy ako abroad. 

Cons- It's hard to find a comfortable house around 2-4k, I might have to rent something for 5k up to get a decent one, I'll need to worry about house items too (which I'm not sure if I should buy new ones since baka di naman ako mag stay ng matagal and my mother also won't allow me to bring any items (even if I purchased all of those). 

Getting a house/condo:

Pros- Probably mas comfortable, if hindi ako matuloy abroad I can have a place to stay long term and even if matuloy ako I can rent it out?

Cons- More expensive

Any thoughts?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/15yrxq4/i_plan_to_finally_move_out/,t2_r77vn1jc,2023-08-23 11:28:46,6

Philippine family culture,"First i'm not a filipino but my GF is and any way i'm here to complain about the filipino culture with good reason...

This one is not going to be about the social economics culture but just about my GF's family and how stupid she is when i come's to them.

Well her father was physically abusive to the male children, and the mother treated the maid better then her daughter(mygf). My gf had to do alot of the same work as the maid and sometimes all of it, also she would buy the maid a dress and shoes while my gf did not have shoes or good once. Alto its not a great injustice it's just and example of the treatment, my gf had a great relationship with her grandmother but her mother got jealous or something and said she could not visit her anymore, there are other petty things like this. For me it was more the father he would as i said earlier physically abuse his male children... i just realized i didn't ask her directly if he ever hurt her... anyway back to the point he would hurt children i don't know when he started but at least he stomped on one of them at the age of 16 because he done something in school to get him in trouble, to me as a Scandinavian we think men like this should be striped naked and his balls cut of because he is not a man he is a dog, alto that might just me my family view tho. My gf says that he has changed and he regrets everything he did to them and she has forgiven him, So the proverbial moral of the story is that i don't want to meet them and i don't want any potential children to be so close to such a monster. She doesn't agree and i said one reason i would not want to meet him is because i will either use my tongue and words to reduced him to tears and make him feel extremely ashamed of him self or if he acts like its cool or his right to do these things i might get way to angry and get physically abuse with him as a 6""2 or 185cm i'm a big guy compared to most Filipinos but he is old too.. then she said to me ""if your rude to him my brother will kill you"" and i'm like ""WHAT THE FLYING COCKSUCKING FUCK"" well because like i said to her is ""your father beats you that's okay but a guy is rude to your father and you kill him?!?!?!? how dose that make scene"" and them she says ""they are more afraid of their father then they are of prison"" and i'm still dumbstruck at how retard they all are. To me from a civilized country were people don't hurt children, and don't kill people for saying something rude, all i want to do is to take my gf home to my country and never let her talk to them again because maybe she says something bad to him when she is their with my child  he gets angry and hurt the child, people don't relay change i will never trust or respect him and as a last note about this guy he got 12million php legal some how i don't remember but not important, he waited almost all of it.... instead of sending all his children to school and collage he wasted it in ways that are beyond stupid.

Please tell me that not all Filipinos are not this stupid and you are against child abuse. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/35vtun/philippine_family_culture/,t2_ex8ty,2015-05-14 06:54:42,0
Need a legal advice abt abusive parents,"Hello, everyone. To give you a short background, my father used to hit me all the time because I was a bit of a difficult child. I used to go to school and seen by my classmates with ""latay"" on my arms. Not long ago, my dad threatened to massacre our entire family with his gun. Thank goodness, I managed to escape. What saddens me is how my mom tolerates him. I'm on my own now and already cut ties with them but I still talk to my sibs. 

Now my youngest sister still lives with them as she's still studying. I was told that my mom now hits her and gets slapped sometimes for standing for what she believes in. She actually wants to get the covid vax to get herself protected from the virus but my mom doesn't permit her. She got verbally and physically abused instead. She's already 19 years old. She's also experienced a lot of traumatic incidents because our parents are fucked. I would very much want to take her in had it not been for my current status. How can I help her even if we're apart? What processes do I have to undergo in case I want to report them to a social worker? Thank you. I'm sorry, I don't mean to offend anyone in case there are parents out there reading this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/q4cyfd/need_a_legal_advice_abt_abusive_parents/,t2_5ceokb7b,2021-10-09 11:06:33,23
Our dad is leaving us 4 kids and my mom,"He is the breadwinner and paid for everything (mom didn't earn much and when she pursued more work he shamed her). He attacked us last month and is now leaving because we refuse to apologize or beg for him to take care of us. He is physically and verbally abusive.

Us boys are 19,21 and 22. I have a little sister who is 13.

He said he is no longer paying for anything, he removed my mom from access to their bank account. He said he is resigning and buying a condo for himself. He is also probably cheating. We will be in the house but will be left to pay for the bills ourselves, our titas have said they could pay for our education.

Anyone have any tips on how to deal with this? Any possible legal action that we can explore?

edit: Me and my kuya are currently employed. We still have not finished our undergrad and my little brother still has to finish his senior year HS.

He has beaten me and my brothers since we were Grade 1. He has dragged me on the street and threatened to leave me there because I got a passing grade in a test.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/hy2m27/our_dad_is_leaving_us_4_kids_and_my_mom/,t2_1qa7tgxl,2020-07-26 15:15:10,29
My life in the Philippines and my life in the USA,"Okay, this post may sound a bit offensive but this is not meant to be a troll post. I am sincere! Sorry to those offended.

I am a full-blooded Filipino born and raised in Manila, Philippines and I fucking hate it!!! I hate the Philippines! Ever since I was born, I have been abused, insulted, and bullied by all Filipinos in my clan!! What I mean by clan are people related to each other by blood. My dad, my mom, my siblings, my uncles, my cousins, my grandparents, and every Filipino in my clan have all bullied, physically beaten, and insulted me!! My parents never fucking loved me! Want to know why they bullied, physically beaten, and insulted me? It's because I said that I want to have a full-blooded white American wife in the future!! It's also because I love watching American movies!! It's also because I love listening to modern popular American music such as rock n roll and R&B!! Seriously, the Filipinos in my clan are all racist to Americans!! They hate the USA!! All Filipinos related to me by blood have all stolen huge amounts of money from each other because they are all greedy-ass pieces of trash!!! My parents stole lots of money from my siblings!!!

Honestly, most Filipinos in the Philippines are really bad like in the paragraphs I wrote above! Most Filipinos in the Philippines are greedy! Most Filipinos in the Philippines are xenophobic to Americans and hate Americans! 

Filipinos from the Philippines are the most racist and the most xenophobic peoples in the whole world!! For example, Thais and Cambodians are welcoming when it comes to accepting American influences while Filipinos are not. Filipinos from the Philippines have committed the worst violent racist atrocities in all of history of the whole world and that includes violent racist atrocities committed outside of the Philippines!! Filipinos(from the Philippines) committed a lot of brutal racist violent killings towards a lot of non-Filipinos not just in the Philippines but also in the USA, Germany, Thailand, etc. Filipinos in Thailand are racist to Thais and brutally murder a lot of Thais just because they are Thais! Filipinos in Hungary brutally murder a lot of Hungarians just because they are Hungarians!

Another thing that I hate about Filipinos is that Filipinos are hateful and violent towards gays and lesbians! Filipino husbands are also the most disgusting in the whole world! Most Filipino husbands are abusive to their wives. They frequently beat and kill their wives! In all honesty, the Philippines has the highest number of murders towards gays and lesbians in the whole world! The Philippines has the highest cases of husbands abusing and killing their wives in the whole world!!

A lot of Filipinos in the streets told me that all of the things that I wrote above are not true and are exaggerated. They then laughed at me. But I am sincere! All these things that I wrote above are true because they are obviously true!

Right now, I am in the USA as a citizen AND I LOVE IT RIGHT HERE! Me, my siblings, and my parents immigrated to the USA when I was 16 years old! During my highschool years in the USA, I was rebellious towards my parents. Read below to know the rebellious things that I did against what my parents wanted me to do.

I had multiple white girlfriends at the same time. I tend to reject and stay away from Filipino girls from the Philippines because most Filipinos(from the Philippines) are just immoral. Also, most Filipino teenage girls I saw in my American highschool are ugly while most American white girls I saw are beautiful. I also had sex with more than 4 of my white girlfriends while I am in a relationship with all of them at the same time. I had orgies with many white girls during my days in my American highschool.

When I was a teenager in the USA, I never wanted to make friends with Filipino immigrants from the Philippines. Filipinos from the Philippines are immoral. I only hang out and make friends with Americans born and raised in the USA. As a teenager in the USA, I loved getting into fights with others, even old people if they insulted me or physically bothered me. But what I hate are people who want to make me do things I don't want to do. For example, there was this old guy who just told me to stop throwing on the house floor, things I no longer like, I then proceeded to brutally beat him up and told him to mind his own business. I never understood why a person wouldn't mind his own business. I hate that type of person. That's what me and my non-Filipino friends did to stupid idiotic faggots like that old guy who won't mind his own business. Stupid dumbasses.

Yeah, when I was a teenager in the USA, I brutally insulted and sweared at a lot of people I found funny or irritated me. I also brutally beat up people I found funny, stupid, or irritating. If someone wants to mess with me, I violently kick his ass. I also disrespected, sweared at, and insulted a lot of adults I found funny, stupid, and irritating. 

A lot of Filipino adults say that I am a badly behaved teenager for all of the things I did in the paragraphs above as a rebellious teenager but they're fucking idiotic dumbass fags because all these things I did aren't bad. They are normal in the USA! Actually, they are normal! They're just weak, sensitive, cowardly dumbshits! LOL. I really love the USA compared to that shithole the Philippines! The Philippines is such a shitty place!  Seriously, Thailand is liberated like the USA while the Philippines is not!

Then there was this stupid Filipino American girl born and raised in the USA. I frequently insult, humiliate, make fun of, and bully her in front of a lot of students in my American high school. I even did it in front of her friends. I made her cry a lot of times. LOL. I didn't physically beat her up though. Want to know why I did all of those things to her? It's because she tries so hard being a traditional Filipino girl that it's hilarious and cringy. She adopted traditional Filipino girl personalities such as dressing modestly, being polite to adults, and being obedient to her parents. She's like those typical Filipino Americans(These Filipino Americans are the kind of Filipino Americans who are jealous of non-Filipino Americans because those non-Filipino Americans still have the non-American cultural influence that they got from their non-American ancestors.) who try so hard to be traditional Filipinos. She's annoying. No matter what she does, she will never be truly Filipino. She will always be an American! LOL.

I am now a 33 year old guy with no children. Currently, I have 4 American white girlfriends at the same time. I also engage in casual sex and orgies with lots of white girls that aren't even my girlfriends. I also still insult and swear at people I find funny, stupid, or irritating. Lots of adult Filipinos(from the Philippines) tell me that what I am doing is immoral but I just rudely tell them that they're just idiotic traditional dumbfucks. LOL. I am also not planning to marry.

As a teenager in the USA, I also disrespected, sweared at, and insulted adults who are forcing me to do things I don't like. For example, there was this adult who told me to stop making fun of a funny idiotic elementary student so I told this stupid moron adult to go suck his cock and I laughed at him. He stopped. One of the reasons why he stopped was probably also because I am taller than him and that I am also well-known as a teenager that loves getting into fights. What a pussy! LOL. Again, I hate a person who won't mind his own business!!!

By the way, I don't go to Facebook or Twitter while all Filipinos related to me by blood do. It's because they're dumbass shitbags while I am not. LOL. I go to Reddit because people on Reddit think like me and are like me. All Filipinos related to me by blood do not go to Reddit. They don't even know that Reddit exists. It's good that they don't go to Reddit or even know that Reddit exists because I don't like the Filipinos in my clan.

Anyways, I hate the Philippines! I hate my parents, my siblings, and my relatives! Also, the Philippines is one of the top 5 poorest countries in the whole world. I wish I was a full-blooded American white guy born and raised in the USA. I love the USA. I am never going back to the shithole that is the Philippines. If I have children, I would never even want my kids to visit the Philippines or my Filipino relatives from the Philippines.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/vhz52m/my_life_in_the_philippines_and_my_life_in_the_usa/,t2_oj8dsdmi,2022-06-22 15:12:47,0
Move Out or Not?," Hi! I am a 21 (almost) Filipina. I'm kind of stuck being in a cycle. Due to the pandemic, I stopped going to school for a year and continued my work as a Call Center Agent with a more or less 20k pay monthly. Now, I got accepted to a free University to continue my studies.

I'm really stuck between staying in this house with my relatives or not because I am mentally so exhausted. My father is mentally and physically abusive to my mom and I see that almost everyday and I cannot do anything about it because everyone in this house thinks it's my mom's fault. My relatives who I am staying with are anti-social and I'm mentally drained. They are gaslighters as well. "" We took care of you so you should take care of us "" or "" You should be the one buying food since you are the one with a salary (none of them in the house is working and are depending on my aunt and uncle in the states). My mom is the only person who lets me be me and accepts me fully.

I feel so depressed living in this house and I always think of moving out. When I stayed by myself for a week ( not ran away from home cause I was 20 when this happened and they told me to return home to help with the homework of my cousin) I felt so alive and free and at peace with myself.

I really don't know what to do. Maybe I just need someone to talk to. I'm just so tired. I know people out there have it harder than me, but what else am I getting up for? I am mentally and emotionally drained. If I move out, I might have a difficult time juggling school, work and bills. If I stay, I can already guess that my mind and heart will have to suffer for a long time.

It's really a long story but this is the gist of it.

If anyone can give me an advice, that would be helpful. Thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/odgzj5/move_out_or_not/,t2_7qa1z6kl,2021-07-04 17:27:06,40
Is this screaming child of a neighbor a sign of abuse or just really terrible twos?,"Tama ba understanding ko na DSWD is kinda like the Social Services counterpart of the US? Medyo nababahala kasi ako with my neighbor's kid.

For context: Family and I live in this apartment complex with three houses. The adjacent house to us is similar but with five houses ata. I have never seen their faces but I can very much hear them.

There is this one kid lang na I am perplexed about because halos iyak siya lagi ng iyak to the point na maingay na siya. In some instances, combo ng sigaw and iyak (like full-on tantrum). I'm pretty sure there are other factors that can contribute to this though.

However, I really don't wanna sound like a Marites pero naririnig ko rin ibang convos ng adults sa household and kadalasan away. :-( Minsan ang harsh pa ng tone niya pagalitan ang bata.

Natatakot lang rin kasi ako na baka the kid is being abused under our noses and it is something I cannot physically stomach.

Is there a good way to address this without a huge Tulfo-like intervention?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/tr11x4/is_this_screaming_child_of_a_neighbor_a_sign_of/,t2_knfrt2z,2022-03-29 22:30:45,6
Any kind hearts here to help me seek help for my mental health?,"Since last night, I've been having it hard. I feel trapped. I have no job because I am prevented to take a job for the past decade. This is because my parents applied for immigration and the only way they can successfully apply in the family category is if they can claim me as completely financially dependent. I went through a severe depression phase from 2011 to 2013 after the death of two elder loved ones and my own rare illness that prevented me to continue my studies and life in general. By the grace of God, I recovered from this autoimmune illness quite fast. I only suffered for a year. But something in me snapped in that year. 2011. The worst year of my life. My mental health continued to improve since June 2013. I went to a school counselor because it was required since my grades were failing. I appreciate that rule by the school. To be fair, I was already feeling better that time but the counselling helped me somehow get even better. So I'd like to think I've slowly beaten depression by then.

But here is my story.
I live at my deceased gradparents' house. I live with one aunt and 2 uncles. My aunt is very negative. All I hear from her all day is negativity and problems. She is also a highly-functioning autistic. And despite these things, I can see that she sincerely cares for me despite her limited self. I appreciate and love her for that. My other uncle is okay. He could use some leadership and balls but I also have love for him since he has been kind to me and my family. Now my other uncle is the biggest problem. He is a drug-addicted, violent, abusive, destructive sociopath. He's physically hurt my mom, their eldest brother, my aunt, my 2 cousins.. and me.
I can't remember how many times we have argued that led him to turn violent. He beats me up, verbally attacks me, destroy things and pointed knives at me on two occasions. There was also a time he attacked me and my mom when she was still here in the country. My aunt and other uncle are also somehow afraid of him. They have tolerated his behavior for the longest time. I also think they feel helpless. For this reason, I try to be distant and not talk to this uncle of mine as much as possible. There is quite a distance between him and us. He's done many traumatic things. He was also to blame for my grandmother's death. He has a very destructive behavior and he doesn't show complex emotions. Only anger and laughter. 

He also does things that inconvenienced me. And when I confront him for these abusive things he does, he turns physically violent and destructive.

Our family's application to the foreign country has been granted. This is also one of the things that has been bothering me for a few months now. I can't imagine living in another country without my longtime friends who are my support system that allowed me to pull through and cope. My parents also expect me to always agree with their choices.

This hurts to confess online:
My parents were physically and emotionally abusive. This has improved through time but I still can't get over their neglect when I was a child. I was forced to live with relatives who were cold to me because they kind of hated them and their lifestyle. I had to endure their insults, verbal abuse, unfair treatment and passive-aggressive comments just because they felt that my parents were neglectful and dependent on them. All those times, my grandparent was the only person I clinged onto. That grandparent of mine has died in 2011. I did not take it very well that time.

I am very anxious. I don't want to live in another country. I don't want to be forced to do things anymore. I want some distance from my parents since our relationship works best that way. I also feel that living with them after a long time will just open a can of worms. Something that won't help my mental and emotional well-being at all. They expect me to be something I'm not. They expect me to want the same things they do. They expect me to live life the way they want me to. They are always dismissive. I have to constantly watch how I act and talk in front of them to please them. I'm so tired of putting on a mask and acting in a role. The ""I'm okay"" and ""I will do what you want"" role. My spirit is crushed. My mind is exhausted.

But the problem is I don't know a way out. I have been financially dependent to them. And out of conscience, I agreed to the immigration application because I want them to fulfill their decade-long dream. But that isn't my dream. That isn't the life I want. I just want to be set free.

Everytime I open up my feelings and share my thoughts to my parents, I am dismissed and scolded. I constantly feel guilty for feeling the way I feel. I feel guilty when I'm happy. I feel guilty when I'm sad. I feel guilty when I'm angry. I feel guilty when I'm in love. I feel guilty when I'm depressed.

I am confused. Over the edge. Having suicidal thoughts. Afraid that I'm back to major depression which I dread. I hate it. I don't want to feel that bad again. A feeling I cannot get out of. Feelings of hopelessness, uselessness and dead end.

Last night, I have been on google searching for painless ways to end my life.

I feel that I have a lot to offer if I am given the chance. If I will be given support, understanding, patience and freedom for my own choices.

TLDR; My life has led me to feel suicidal. I want to die because I think it's the easiest way out. But I'm also afraid of hurting myself. I'm afraid of causing pain to those who truly love me. I'm afraid of having an unsuccessful attempt and living the rest of my life suffering its consequences. That will really suck even harder. I don't want to hurt myself and cause inconvenience to other people. I have wonderful friends but I'm afraid of being a burden to them. I need help. Please.

"Para sa mga tito/tita of Manila jan, around how much is a good sweldo range if you want to live solo?","Edit: Location specified

A little back story, I(24) left my home because my mom is abusive. She hit me physically and she uses me like an atm. Y'all know how parents are (you're lucky if yours aren't).

"Senate Bill 1190 ""Philippine Mental Health Act of 2016""","Hi! I'm the redditor who posted on yesterday's NRD and this morning's DRD about attending the filing of the Mental Health Act today. I told a few other people here that I'd try to give live updates, but since I wasn't able to, I'll just post everything here. Apologies for any grammar or formatting errors! ~~weeps~~


&nbsp;


Akbayan Senator Risa Hontiveros, together with former Senator Leticia Ramos-Shahani, Be Healed Foundation founder Jerika Ejercito, and other advocates, filed Senate Bill 1190 otherwise known as the ""Philippine Mental Act of 2016.""


&nbsp;


**MENTAL HEALTH ACT** 

Former Sen. Shahani, way back in 1986, filed a resolution which seeks to study the status of the Mental Health here in the Philippines. Fellow legislators didn't take interest in it, so it was dropped. Currently, the Philippines is the only ASEAN country without a Mental Health bill to protect its citizens. With the filing of this senate bill, Shahani admits that this is an expensive undertaking, and will definitely take time before it is passed.


&nbsp;


**SUICIDE** 

Dr. Ed Tolentino, from the Philippine Psychiatric Association, said that suicide is on the rise. In a study conducted last 2011, it was found that 16% of students between 13 to 15 years old have been considering attempting suicide over the past year. 13% actually attempted once or twice during the past year. 


&nbsp;


**DRUG ABUSE**

Dr. Tolentino gave a speech and provided numbers re: drug users. According to him, last 2008, there are 1.7M drug users in the Philippines. In another national survey conducted last 2012 estimated 1.3M still use drugs. It grew to a staggering amount of 4.8M Filipinos who have used drugs once in their lives, and 1.8M current drug users last 2015 (2.3% of our population). According to the latest data from PDEA, 3-3.7M are drug users at the moment. The top three used are cannabis, shabu, and cocaine. 


&nbsp;


Jerika Ejercito, daughter of former president Erap Estrada, gave a powerful sharing about her years of battling depression, after her father was ousted from Government. 
> Here I am today, I stand before you as a survivor of a debilitating disorder called depression. Having gone through it myself, it is natural for me to empathize to those who are suffering in silence. Going through depression made me realize the lack of support people living with disorder get from the society at large. It pains me because Filipinos are known to be warm and caring individuals, yet it seems to me that people living with disorder – not just depression, are condemned and judged daily. I truly believe that the Filipino people are capable of finally moving on from a very simplistic view of mental disorders and give way to a future that gives equal opportunities to those who have been greatly marginalized for years. We must shift up our focus away from what seems to be the problem; drug abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse – we continuously fail to realize that these are only manifestations of a deeper epidemic that requires serious attention not only by psychiatrists and psychologists all over the country, not only by the victims of these disorders and their family, but by the national government itself. Stop persecuting the so-called addicts. Instead, focus on creating a proper health care facilities and programs needed by these victims of either circumstances or debilitating illness that is very much beyond their control. I quote Sen. Bernie Sanders, *“Drugs is not a criminal issue. It is a health issue.”* But let me go deeper and say that drugs is not a criminal issue nor is it a health issue. It is a mental health issue. Addiction is a mental health disorder. So rather than overpopulating our prisons or rehab facilities, let our government assist and aid the recovery of these victims because they can be a vital part of our society. That’s all they need; a second chance. 


&nbsp;


**1 IN 5 FILIPINOS HAVE A MENTAL DISORDER**

1 in 5 adult Filipinos suffer from a mental disorder. This is an average of 88 reported (reported only, mind you) mental illness per 100,000 Filipinos. According to studies and government statistics, Sen. Hontiveros said that our country has the highest number of depressed people in Southeast Asia, with schizophrenia as the top mental health disorder among Filipinos. 


&nbsp;


**LACK OF PSYCHIATRISTS AND SERVICES**

50% of the adults who went to Rural Health Centers are found to have some form of psychological illness, but these health centers are unequipped in providing them services. Hontiveros also noted that there are only 490 psychiatrists licensed to practice here in the country, and that there are only 2 National Mental Health Institutions, both of which are in NCR.


&nbsp;


**RIGHTS OF THE PERSONS WITH MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS**

Sen. Hontiveros' bill seeks to uphold the rights of persons with mental health needs to receive services appropriate for them at all levels of the health care system. The bill also pushes for the client's participation in the formulation of a psychosocial treatment plan fit for them, consent, establishment of neurological services especially in regional areas, alternative treatment, and for the creation of a mental health care system. The senator also added that integration of mental health in the education curriculum is salient in fighting the stigma.


&nbsp;


Senator Hontiveros ended with
> For the longest time, many people with mental health needs are silently suffering in the dark due to the lack of a comprehensive mental health law. It’s time we uphold the people’s right to mental health and protect the rights of those who require mental health services.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/56577q/senate_bill_1190_philippine_mental_health_act_of/,t2_119d7s,2016-10-06 20:49:00,94

ELI5 riding jeeps/trikes/taxis,"That's right, for all of those three. ELI5 or ELIT (explain like I'm tourist)

I usually drive a car, and despite not being a total virgin to public transport, the last time I've been on jeeps/trikes/taxis was when I was under 10 years old. Even then, I was always with my kuya

Basically, I wanna start commuting on my own and don't want to look like an idiot doing it. 

1. How and where to grab rides? 

2. How to ballpark the payment based on distance? Does payment also increase with more passengers? 

3. Where and when can you use them? (I like riding trikes but I know they're not allowed in most roads?)

4. Basic instruction and etiquette (giving directions, paying, etc). Also, how do you get off prematurely just in case?

6. And most importantly for me, how do you keep safe? (20-year old guy here. I'm not at my best physically, and I don't like bringing ""pepper spray"" for the stigma of women only using it. I was raped before in my pre-pubescent years and was also sexually/physically abused as a child so I know that male rape happens and is, in fact, one of my biggest fears. This is the reason for this thread since it took me some balls to even consider commuting.)

Students = NPA,"I know, late ako sa balita. I don't watch the news anymore ever since... Well, ever since Duterte started his genocide that the mindless ones here loved. Anyway,

I heard my mom recently refer to UP students as ""members of the NPA"" and of course I was like, 🤔🤔🤔 'cause wth that's not a thing. Who thinks that even? She said that she heard it on the news. I asked who said that on the news, what was their source, and she got mad 'cause she doesn't like discussions and it was enough for her that we have food in the house and all that typical stuff (i dunno why she said those as it was not relevant to my questions).

Without Googling, I am pretty sure that a bunch of students from rich families PLUS the ones on a scholarship wouldn't leave their families behind to join NPA and go against the government through rallies while still being in school. That's too crazy even for a country where the Millennials here still hold dear the outdated and nonsensical ways of our Boomers (like verbal and physical abuse = healthy discipline, or circumcision boosts your height even though i am still shorter than the average american who is NOT circumcised).

With a quick Google (again, kasi late na late ako sa balita 😂), there are either allegations of a UP student, who was also an NPA member, killed during a military encounter (source: manila bulletin and philippine news agency), or there are testimonies from former members who claim that a group of PUP and UP students were forced by the NPA to join them during an outdoor activity (source: inquirer). Also, none of the results so far are related to any of their protests/rallies. So, dafuq, mom? 😂

Am I missing something here or is the whole UP = NPA shtick just a load of bull?

Edit: grammar coz ENGLISH = SECOND LANGUAGE. Also, I can't help but notice yet again that whenever I post something with Dutertard, it gets downvoted lmao.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/flss26/students_npa/,t2_4epd56cf,2020-03-20 18:27:47,4
Should I report my neighbor for animal abuse (parrots)?,"Hello po

My neighbor used to own 2 African Grey (AG) parrots and originally kept them in a factory/warehouse then moved them into his garage. One of them escaped and flew away a month ago and now only 1 AG remains.

Here's the reasons why I want to report him for animal abuse:

* Bad Living Conditions

The living conditions of the AG are extremely depressing. They have the intelligence of a 7 year old human yet they lack any physical or mental stimulation as there are no toys, only a single perch, almost no sunlight nor any greenery/nature etc.

Their cage is unfit to house parrots as the dimensions are too small, and the spacing between the bars are wide enough to put their heads through, meaning they can break their necks or choke themselves if their heads are outside when startled.

&#x200B;

* Kept inside a garage

Constant exposure to car fumes, toxic Teflon fumes from non-stick pans from the nearby kitchen, and possibility of a gas leak from the LPG tank, both of which are extremely hazardous to parrots due to their vulnerable respiratory system and would cause long term health issues and a painful death respectively.

&#x200B;

* Poor diets

When I talked with the maids, they told me that their diet is mostly seeds and some fruit, and they sometimes don't fill their flimsy plastic bottle cut-out water bowls because they tip them over and make a mess on the garage floor.

&#x200B;

* African Greys CANNOT live alone

The remaining AG will eventually suffer from several health issues, such as self-mutilation, which can lead to permanent bald spots, anxiety, depression, chronic loneliness and stress, and many more.

&#x200B;

One thing I'd like to add is that the neighbor is very rich. He has 2 BMW SUVs and a van in the garage. I told the maid to tell him about my offer to buy perches and toys and have him pay me back for them, but he never contacted me. I gave my contact details 3 times and never heard back.

I wrote him a [letter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gLth4JnGspJGYNns9M62xGGgP7FvACasSpu6ESERKLU/edit?usp=sharing) which I slipped under their door last week.

There are a few more reasons, but that's the summary of it. I plan to contact PAWS to report him, but I don't know if they will do anything.

Thank you all for reading.

Has anyone registered or know someone who registered as a PWD because of their mental illness?,"*""Under RA 10524, Persons with Disability (PWDs) refer to individuals who suffer long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments which, upon interaction with various barriers, may hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others.""*

I've been diagnosed with mental illness in 2016 but have had the symptops for several years before then. I have had deep problems with socialization, have lost several jobs, have neglected basic hygiene at times and have let my health deteriorate because of this. I still do count myself as high-functioning because most of the time I can keep myself alive. And although my status at work is rocky, I'm also currently employed. My question do I qualify as a PWD? If so, how do I go about registering as one? I haven't really been seeing any doctor regularly so I don't have any professionals to ask. I mainly wish to get discounts on my meds (which is a huge bulk of my expenses) and basic needs since money is really tight. I guess my second question is - is it morally/ ethically right? I know a lot of people abuse their PWD privileges and I'm afraid to count as one of them. I do go to theatres and restaurants at times and the discount is definitely something I can see myself using.

Edit: With hindsight, this probably would have been more apt on the weekly help or daily discussion thread since it's too personal, but I hope the mods will let me keep this for more visibility and it may also help someone else.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/8a5ahd/has_anyone_registered_or_know_someone_who/,t2_rucq1,2018-04-06 08:55:51,17
[LF: Advice] Minsan Pakiramdam Ko Nasa Panganib Ang Buhay Ko,"Di ko mae-explain masyado pero may napapansin ako minsan sa kuya ko dahil sa malakas na aggressiveness niya at maliit na emotional maturity. 22-23 years old na siya, kaso malakas siya magtantrums. Nung nao-overload siya sa workload niya sa online classes niya sa college, nasusuntok niya yung pader tas napapasigaw sa galit. Naiintindihan ko na nakakasama ng loob yun kaso napaka-abnormal na yun para sa edad niya. Siya lang yung kilala ko na ganiyan.

May mga panahon din dati na hindi niya maintindihan ang concept of consent. Hindi talaga kami nagkakasunduan ng kuya ko, pilit lang na makipagsunduan esp nung sinapak niya ako nung 15 years old ako (20 na ako), nao-offend siya nung pinaparating ko sa kaniya na ayaw ko sa kaniya at kapag sinasabi ko na ""no"" o ""ayaw ko"" tungkol sa mga bagay-bagay. Napapa-tantrum siya. Ang lakas ng boses kung magtanong ng kung bakit ganon nararamdaman ko.

Dahil sa mga characteristics niya na ganiyan kasama na yung sobrang lakas niya magalit, minsan nararamdaman ko na baka at some point magwala siya at mapatay ako. Aside kasi sa mga nabanggit ko, nao-observe ko na may mali nga sa kaniya psychologically. Gawa rin ito kasi ng pagiging physically abusive ng tatay ko nung mas bata pa kami, at siya palagi yung scapegoat.

Nakwento ko na ito sa mga kaibigan ko kaso hirap kami magisip ng plano if ever may mangyari. Hindi ko kaya iwan mga alaga namin kasi parehas kuya ko at tatay ko mapanakit sa kanila kapag napipikon o naiinis sa hindi nila maintindihan sa mga aso namin. Nagaalala ako baka kung ano gawin nila sa kanila kapag bumukod na ako dito. Hindi ko rin kaya sabihan nanay ko kasi ofw siya at masyado niya binibigyan ng significance ang mga sibling relationship kaya mas uunahin niya yun kesa sa mga napapansin ko dito sa bahay.

"Lawyers of Reddit PH, please enlighten us about VAW procedures.","Sample situation: Ana lives with her partner, Juan, who is physically and emotionally violent/abusive towards her. Ana used to stay at her parents house in Old City but is now staying with Juan in New City.  In her official records, she lives in Old City. She also stays there sometimes. Ana experienced violence in their home.

* **Blotter** \- can this be filed in either the barangay or police station? If in the barangay, in which barangay can this be filed - in the place of the incident or Ana's residence, or both? Who can file for this?
* **BPO** \- can this be filed - in the place of the incident or Ana's residence, or both? Who can file for this?
* **Medico - legal certificate** \- Are these offered only in Public Hospitals? Can the victim be accompanied by someone during the check-up and can the hospital/doctor refuse that accompanying person entry? Just wondering in case the victim is uncomfortable being checked on her own. 
* **For all of the above** \- Are the issuances of these dependent on office hours or can they be acquired anytime, especially considering that Ana is at risk for experiencing more violence.

[RANT] I've had enough of our undisciplined and unprofessional military men.,"The military indeed has a toxic environment, but I've had enough of their unprofessionalism and undisciplined military men. I was a P2LT (Probationary 2nd Lieutenant) from a unit and branch of service I will not disclose, and here are some of the stories I'll tell from what I've experienced.

**1) Nepotism is still rampant.**

Okay, I know y'all are gonna say, ""Isn't it rampant in all parts of our government? And to that, I say, ""Yes, it is, but I think it's deeply engraved in the AFP.""

There are around 20,000 individuals who applied for the officer candidate course (OCC) alone. Most of them sold their families' fortune so that they could go through with the application process. I didn't even consider myself lucky at that time until I heard from my classmate that a lot of people (from several regions in the Philippines) tried to apply for the course and didn't reach the quota. Of the 20,000 applicants, only a thousand would pass the AFPSAT. This number would then be slashed to half or even to a quarter after the Physical Fitness Test then after this would be the Medical, where some of the 'unhealthy' ones would get slashed. There are a lot of tests you'll have to undergo here (but it's all free). From Bloodchem, and ECGs to Neuro and Dental, where dentists would recommend you to get your wisdom tooth extracted and braces removed. The wisdom tooth extraction would be done outside so it isn't free.  During the Medical phase, you are also asked to submit authenticated documents for commissionship. 

After that, you'll undergo Special Written Exam (SWE) where you're timed and you'll have to answer three to five essays ranging from topics about your personal life to politics and your knowledge in the military. This was the easiest part for me. After that, the Final Interview would then be conducted by the Personnel Management Center (PMC). After you've passed all these steps, you'll be waiting for their call if you have passed and are included in the class that will be undergoing the training. 

Here's one about nepotism though, I have several classmates that have skipped these tedious steps. I also have several classmates that have blurry vision, are hypertensive, and are downright obese. Here's the funniest part though, a classmate of mine mentioned one applicant (a classmate of ours) who purposely failed the exam in Neuro so that he wouldn't get included in the class but his father had strong ties with the medical unit that he was still included to undergo training with us.  By this time, I should have been extremely turned off by the institution. 

**2) Unprofessional servicemen** 

The BOS I joined had this core principle about practicing Professionalism. The sad thing though is that most of their servicemen (both EPs and Officers) are extremely unprofessional. I remembered one conversation I had with this captain in which I asked about where I could submit my documents and he answered with a sarcastic question. 

I could also remember an experience when I tried to ask about the status of my documents. Still, after hearing that I wasn't an active military personnel, she just went on and closed the curtain from the window.

Also, I forgot to mention that the application process (from AFPSAT to interview) took up an entire year, and you'll get messages from them on short notice from weeks to mere days. This action is then justified by saying 'This is the military way'.

A senior of mine shared his story that after getting medically discharged, he had to wait for a year and it was until he kept on pestering the unit that he was eventually admitted to AFPMC for a medical test.

Also during boot camp, most of our Military Training Instructors (MTIs) violated rules implemented inside the military bases like alcohol and hazing. This then brings me to my third and final thought

**3) Most of our servicemen are undisciplined.**

Be it officers or enlisted personnel, most of them are undisciplined. This stems from the unrefined training procedures and unqualified MTIs. Moreover, these unqualified MTIs boasting and proliferating the culture of 'take life' doesn't help. Several of my MTIs even boasted of smuggling alcohol and cigarettes for an instructor during his training days. Instead of instilling discipline, and strengthening the mind and the body of cadets, the training phase of cadets centers around thinking of ways to abuse these rules and regulations, often applauding them, which then seeps into their work life as they graduate. This in turn creates undisciplined servicemen who are easily influenced by the practice of corruption and nepotism. 

With numerous accounts from my fellow servicemen (including the ones from the Marawi siege and others), both EPs and Officers, I've come to realize that serving in the military institution isn't all that gratifying. I applied for the military profession so I could learn discipline (while also staying fit: I wanted to join the cycling team of PA) and help defend our fellow citizens but all these first-hand experiences just turned me off. I am currently waiting for a disposition but have no hope of returning.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/1507n5h/rant_ive_had_enough_of_our_undisciplined_and/,t2_2lgjqw5r,2023-07-15 17:42:58,131
It's always health before job? Aren't both important important in our current situation?,"
Was i wrong?

I grew up having overprotective and strict parents. There was a lot of physical, verbal and mental abuse when i was young. Today, we are already struggling financially due to the pandemic and it is making me nervous tho i am not affected a lot of companies are now having mass layoff.

We were given the choice to stay at the company sleeping quarters because the shuttle service is limited and the traffic is already bad going in and out metro manila. 

So i decided to move out.
1. So my family won't be at risk.
2. So i can still provide for them financially. 
3. Also for my mental health because they are extremely manipulative and guilt tripping me.

[Serious]Still confused about the anti-terror bill. Is there a summary on how exactly it prevents free speech?,"Section 4 defines an act of terrorism as:

    (a) Engages in acts intended to cause death or serious bodily injury to any
    person, or endangers a person’s life;
    
    (b) Engages in acts intended to cause extensive damage or destruction to a
    government or public facility, public place or private property:
    
    (c) Engages in acts intended to cause extensive interference with, damage or
    destruction to critical in&astructure;
    
    (d) Develops, manufactures, possesses, acquires, transports, supplies or uses
    weapons, explosives or of biological, nuclear, radiological or chemical weapons;
    and
    
    (e) Release of dangerous substances, or causing fire, floods or explosions when
    the purpose of such act, by its nature and context, is to intimidate the general
    public or a segment thereof create an atmosphere or spread a message of fear, to
    provoke or influence by intimidation the government or any of its international
    organization, or seriously destabilize or destroy the fundamental political,
    economic, or social structures of the country, or create a public emergency or
    seriously undermine public safety, 
    
    Provided, That, terrorism as defined in this Section shall not include advocacy,
    protest, dissent, stoppage of work, industrial or mass action, and other simdar
    exercises of civil and political rights, which are not intended to cause death or
    serious physical harm to a person, to endanger a person’s life, or to create a
    serious risk to public safety.

I've seen posts and comments that say, Section 9 allows the government to tag online criticism as an act of terrorism:

    Sec. 9. Inciting to Commit Terrorism. - Any person who, without taking any direct
    part in the commission of terrorism, shall incite others to the execution of any
    of the acts specified in Section 4 hereof by means of speeches, proclamations,
    writings, emblems, banners or other representations tending to the same end,
    shall suffer the penalty of imprisonment of twelve (12) years.

But I don't really get it. As long as the online posts don't contain a threat to someone's life, destruction of property, development and distribution of weapons, or mass destruction, then it should be alright, right?

EDIT: The bill also allows a person suspected of terrorism to be detained for up to 24 days.

"[seriously need help] Introducing my almost half a year 8 years older Indian boyfriend to family, need advice..","Basically, here are what bother me:

1. He's 8 years older than me and my sister has expressed her worries about him being really older than me [21].

2. He's Indian and India is known for arranged marriages. My sister had a friend before who had an Indian boyfriend. They had to split up because when the guy's parents found out he's seeing a non-Indian girl, they married him off right away.

3. He's been married before. They divorced because the girl was abusing him mentally, physically, and verbally and disrespected his parents.

I'm hoping the people who'd answer here are parents so they can give me that kind of perspective. He's the first guy I'll ever introduce to my family.

[Serious] How do I report my ex-boyfriend for physically hurting me?,"My relationship with my boyfriend wasn't good from the start. It was emotionally abusive at first, and sooner it lead to punching me at one point and left large bruises on my arm, face and popped my lips (this was a year ago). I asked helped from his mom and she told me to break up with him for a moment to let things cool down, but I was stupid and so blind, I did not listen to her.

Last night we went drinking with one of his friends. We woke up this morning and while hangover, he started a conversation about my personal issues. I'm very depressed lately, and things weren't going so good in my life. He started taunting me, then making fun of my depression, then started telling me things like I should kill myself because I'm just a burden for my family, his life and my friends. I told him to be quiet but he would never stop. This went on for full fifteen minutes. I got tired, so I just put my earphones on so I won't hear him anymore.

I was laying on the bed. He then kicked me on my thigh. I told him what the hell was wrong with him, and he took his desk chair and threatened to throw it to me. This made me so mad I shouted and slapped him on the face. He punched me on my left hip, then stomach. I shouted at the door so his mother could hear me. ""Your son is physically hurting me!"" I opened the door and let his mother in, I told her what he did to me and she helped me get out of the room. She told me I should report him to the police and advised me that I should take a break from seeing him, which I would gladly now do so.

"The Declaration of Martial Law - September 21, 1972","Watch the declaration of Martial Law, aired on September 23, 1972.

&#x200B;

At 7:17 pm on September 23, 1972, President [Ferdinand Marcos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Marcos) announced on television that he had placed the entirety of the [Philippines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines) under [martial law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_law). This marked the beginning of a 14-year period of one-man rule that would effectively last until Marcos was exiled from the country on February 25, 1986.Even though the formal document proclaiming martial law – Proclamation No. 1081, which was dated September 21, 1972 – was formally lifted on January 17, 1981, Marcos retained essentially all of his powers as dictator until he was ousted.

While the period of Philippine history in which Marcos was in power actually began seven years earlier, when he was first inaugurated president of the Philippines in late 1965, this article deals specifically with the period where he exercised dictatorial powers under martial law, and the period in which he continued to wield those powers despite technically lifting the proclamation of martial law in 1981.

When he declared martial law in 1972, Marcos claimed that he had done so in response to the ""communist threat"" posed by the newly founded [Communist Party of the Philippines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_the_Philippines) (CPP), and the sectarian ""rebellion"" of the [Mindanao Independence Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindanao_Independence_Movement) (MIM). Opposition figures of the time, such as [Lorenzo Tañada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_Ta%C3%B1ada), [Jose W. Diokno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jose_W._Diokno), and [Jovito Salonga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jovito_Salonga), accused Marcos of exaggerating these threats, using them as a convenient excuse to consolidate power and extend his tenure beyond the two presidential terms allowed by the 1935 constitution.

After Marcos was ousted, government investigators discovered that the declaration of martial law had also allowed the Marcoses to hide secret stashes of unexplained wealth that various courts later determined to be ""of criminal origin"".

This 14-year period in Philippine history is remembered for the administration's record of [human rights abuses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_abuses_of_the_Marcos_dictatorship), particularly targeting political opponents, student activists, journalists, religious workers, farmers, and others who fought against the [Marcos dictatorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictatorship). Based on the documentation of Amnesty International, [Task Force Detainees of the Philippines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_Force_Detainees_of_the_Philippines), and similar human rights monitoring entities, historians believe that the Marcos dictatorship was marked by 3,257 known [extrajudicial killings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrajudicial_killing), 35,000 documented tortures, 77 'disappeared', and 70,000 incarcerations.

&#x200B;

 

Several conflicting accounts about exist regarding the exact date on which Marcos signed the physical Proclamation No. 1081 document, which placed the entirety of the Philippines under martial law.

Whichever the case, the document was formally dated September 21 because of his superstitions and [numerological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerology) beliefs concerning the number seven.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_law_under_Ferdinand_Marcos#cite_note-OfficialGazetteDeclaration-1) The Official Gazette of the republic of the Philippines, in a retrospective article on Marcos' proclamation of martial law, comments on the differences in the accounts:

>""Whether they conflict or not, all accounts indicate that Marcos’ obsession with numerology (particularly the number seven) necessitated that Proclamation No. 1081 be officially signed on a date that was divisible by seven. Thus, September 21, 1972 became the official date that martial law was established and the day that the Marcos dictatorship began. This also allowed Marcos to control history on his own terms.""

Why the country's religiousness is the root cause of its biggest cultural problems,"Admit it, at some point we have to discuss how religion, especially Abrahamic ones, are the reason why the Philippines:
• is mostly misogynistic, patriarchal, and sexist,
• is being taken advantage of its resilience,
• is so conservative that it leaves no room for liberal but beneficial and progressive ideals.


Misogyny, Patriarchy, Sexism (feat. Homophobia)

You could tally as many female-supportive Bible quotes as you want but it still wouldn't be half as many as those supportive of men. And by ""supportive"", I mean basically dictating that men are more important than women. And that's without even equating the quotes that dictate women to be compliant and obedient to men, especially their husbands.

And that's without including the Quran.

To think that these ideas are being instilled to us for 333 years, the Philippines went from being ""genderless"" or ""gender doesn't matter"" during pre-colonial times to using bakla as an insult whenever men show weakness or non-masculine traits and calling tomboyish, non-feminine women undesirable.


""Resilience"" aka Enforced Placebo

Ignoring the Bible's sexism, incest, and murder that rivals that of Game of Thrones, it does have a lot of feel-good quotes like Songs of Solomon and the many assurances that God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit will be there, will provide, will help you in times of trouble, etc.

The problems is too many Filipinos take these quotes to heart (and not just in the spiritual sense) that they let it affect their lives to an impractical scale.

Drowning in debt? God will provide! Suffering with physical pains and emotional trauma? Jesus will save! Having too many mouths to feed and pregnant with one more while barely living above the poverty line? It's a miracle from Him!

You don't have to wait for God to provide if you manage your money more and vote for politicians that don't inflate our costs of living every decade or so.

Yes, Jesus might save but you also need to go to the hospital to have it checked. Or maybe you just need to go to a psychiatrist and acquire some meds for your depression. You're not sad because you need more Jesus, you're sad because your brain is stubborn at it.

No, having more than 5 children with an incoming 6th while you could barely scrape by for your next meal is not a miracle, it's a disaster for dysfunctional family dynamics and lost childhood. You would've fed less than what you can afford if you weren't so adamant to believe that condoms and birth control pills are marked with 666 and ""kills"" life. You can't kill what's not even there. There's also the topic of abortion but, of course, our country will never be ready for that.

And all this is made worse by the fact that politicians and government officials love to exploit the hell out of this resilience by quoting God, praying for him, and seeking help from him while they pocket the expenses meant for the assisitance they are praying for.

And the crowd would follow suit and say ""Amen"".

And these people wonder why most secular and practical countries are first-wolrders.


Ultra-Conservatism

Religion, especially Catholicism, has long been enforcing the idea that too much freedom corrupts. Even though God gave as free will. But apparently everything is also God's plan so that free will is pretty much pointless.

Either way, these ideals are pretty much the reason why any law or idea that's rooted from liberal ideals are shot down immediately. And more so if those laws are not in line with a politician's Biblical views, no matter how great they will be for the general well-being of a lot of Filipinos.

And we're only talking about rights that give people a little freedom in general like:

A SOGIE bill that could ensure the well-being of LGBT Filipinos from being discriminated in their workplace and basically have the same civil rights as heterosexuals like getting married by law? But the Bible says no, so NO.

A divorce bill that could be for beneficial for women in abusive marriages but do not have the financial means for annulment and could ensure that their children are financially supported even after separation? But th-the-the sanctity of marriage! DENIED!

And let's not get started how a lot would talk shit about the Anti-Bastos Law before it was passed like: Women making men accountable for their unconsented sexual advances? Then they should dress and act more modestly like the Bible says so! It's their fault they're dressed in shorts and tank tops like a whore!


And they would stand for all this while doing the opposite. Except, of course, for misogyny.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/i69nid/why_the_countrys_religiousness_is_the_root_cause/,t2_64y6g13e,2020-08-09 08:01:28,182
[Serious] Let's talk about rape.,"Posted this last night sa ERD (oh wow that's a thing now)

> Let's talk about rape.

> In light of the [Badang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_1W8d1e_bs) case/allegation I've found myself still in need of answers na I was hoping some of you guys already have. Ito rin kasing [post ni Kat Alano](http://imgur.com/a/wqFIU) relating to that, while I found agreeable, e medyo extreme at nakakaparanoid na mindset.

> Anyway main question is: how do we eliminate rape?

> Does this topic deserve its own thread? Tingin ko lang kailangan muna ng enough attention sa RD before we go in-depth if we have to

A lot of us seem to agree that one way to do it is by simply teaching children about consent (u/syaochan + upvotes). u/trufflepastaxciv adds chemical castration. Victim shaming and cultural views also seem to influence people into committing the act as if it were some God-given right.

Also here are some questions I raised last night

> But about rape culture...

> How would you draw the line between ""rape culture"" and plain misogyny? Do we count ""the patriarchy"" as a contributor to this ""rape culture""? How does this male-dominated worldview promote rape as a right? What of male victims of female offenders? Different environments growing up, perhaps?

> Think cannibalism. Sounds logical in extreme cases, but was once an acceptable practice of some civilizations, also probably with some spiritual tie-up and not plainly for sustenance. Pero ngayon we'd (I hope) view it as plain absurd, disgusting, savage and unnecessary. How do you think can we get to treating rape as such? Harmless alternatives that would allow offenders to let out their urges?

Oh yeah. So more ideas and more questions that we can discuss maybe? If you have stuff to add let's talk about it, share experiences maybe that people can learn from

---

My 2 cents on the Badang case and my views on rape and me experiences

> **Fliptop** - it's a great form of art, competitors engaging in not-so-friendly banter, bars, rap, delivery, all that. It's just quite unfortunate that it seems that a lot of its young followers take it at face value and thus have these twisted ideas about sex, drugs, alcohol, badmouthing and all that, so hopefully the guys in charge speak out about it kahit konti lang

> **Badang case** - sabi nga dun sa YouTube? or Facebook comment it wasn't the first time, apparently Badang's first victim was the guy's niece, still he let him stay at his home, living with his 16 y/o daughter. Nope man I get you trust this guy and that you're giving him a chance to prove he's not as bad but man that's your daughter chong. Pretty dumb risk. He'll probably lose his daughter's trust after all this, hopefully not to some douche or drugs or a clique of dipshits

> **Rape and Sexual Abuse** - fuck tangina this. There are many terrible things in life but this one's the worst. No one deserves rape, not even rapists deserve rape. It's existence is just so stupid that it's one of the biggest influences that shaped my spiritual faith. Why does your physical body respond positively to abuse? Why do women get pregnant from this? What the fuck happened to intelligent design? Unforgivable.

> **Offender and Victim** - Not sure how common this is but I can say I've been on both sides. None of my experiences are premeditated, most of which failed attempts at coercion on one side and me just allowing things to happen on the other. No rape or penetration either way so it's not rape by some definition, but I think it's the thought that counts? Of violating and the experience of being violated. So I guess semi-AMA? I'll probably be okay with talking about these things but will of course obscure or change some details

> **As Offender** - Unforgivable. ""Tsansing"", coercion, molesting, it's all just giving in to temptation. There's a rush you get from doing so, sometimes because of the place, of the target, or from the fulfillment of not getting caught, a challenge you thought to be impossible. Yeah sure all that. But little boys and girls if you wish to be a decent person **PLEASE** don't fall for it as it will ruin your life. It will create or allow bad habits that are near impossible to change. Remembering the things I did made me lose faith in myself. I'd have to assume my tendencies so I'll be actively trying to stop them. Also, especially for guys, remember this checklist. If you get to four or something YOU WILL DEFINITELY GIVE IN (or someone will be up to something) so uncheck the items before it escalates:

* Lack of sleep/waking up in the middle of sleep/either person sleepy

* Place is dimly lit (like night lamps, faint yellow lighting, dark room with few lights, little access to sunlight, tinted windows etc)

* Drunk/Tipsy

* Past midnight/mid-afternoon

* Close contact (like napping side-by-side, sharing covers, hands held, embracing etc)

* Person is fairly attractive, not necessarily beautiful or handsome, due to some personality trait or other physical stuff

* Clothing that's easily ""bypassed?"" (like thin fabric, loose shirts, skimpy outfits). Not saying clothing decides it, but it makes things easier

* Secluded place or at least gives that sense of security (a very busy place, very quiet place, everyone else occupied, quiet)

* Being aware of these things and still giving off the impression that you trust the person that it won't happen, allowing the ""setup"" (intentional or not) to take place. Move away and make it absolutely clear with your non-verbal language that you will not allow even the slightest possibility. You will not do it and you will not let them do it.

> **As Victim** - Let's just say I was molested by a friend of a friend when I was a kid. Didn't really feel significant unless it fucked up my anatomy somehow. Same time as being the offender, I kinda allowed myself to be groped in public transport, once at work and once with a flatmate. It sucks that I'm giving them the satisfaction but at the same time, I wanted to make sure I remember what a victim would feel if I were to do something similar, especially to someone I'd consider as a friend. Most recently, well technically, I was raped by a female friend (I'm male if it's still not obvious) but it's more of coercion because I just let her do it maybe? I wanted to kill her out of disappointment but I thought she ought to have something nice because she's feeling quite alone and down for a while. I wasn't into it and she definitely knew but she kept going yeah not quite a big deal, best revenge I think is to etch in that head of hers that she raped someone when she has kids to educate welp. I'm not like ""omg he's totally adorbs"" handsome but I think I give off that ""yeah he's ok I'll add him to my collection"" vibe, often being condescending and arrogant, but having these puppy dog eyes some men/women would probably want to dream of dominating so that kinda adds to it

Armed Takeover of Ocean Adventure and Camayan Beach Resort,"On the night of 13 February after dark, a group of about 70 armed persons, comprised of disgruntled former employees, thugs, mercenaries, and allegedly two generals and members of the Philippines National Police, took over Ocean Adventure and Camayan Beach Resort at gunpoint and continue to occupy it while denying employees entry. The incident was instigated by Scott N. Sharpe and Gail E. Laule, Americans from California. The occupiers have abused and ejected employees from their dormitories, removed security personnel, broke down doors in search of people, and broken into the company vault; furthermore, they have commandeered the hotel and marine park, stopped construction on the Adventure Beach Waterpark (which was set to open April 1, but will now be impossible), and suspended normal operations of the company. Their presence is illegal, and they were not accompanied by the civil authorities nor did they have a court order.

Attorney Manuel Quijano, who has allegedly been party to similar hostile takeovers in the region, assisted Mr. Sharpe in leading the attack and physically assaulted two employees during the take over.

Attorney Wilma Eisma, SBMA Administrator, came on site after management reported the illegal intrusion. She interviewed Mr. Sharpe and others, but left without ordering the hostile occupiers off the premises. The siege continues and has become more severe, displacing hundreds of local workers.

Mr. Sharpe meanwhile pronounced himself the new Chairman and CEO of Ocean Adventure. According to insiders, the night of the attack he credited over 41,000 pesos worth of food and alcohol to his account to feed the thugs he hired to occupy the company. Atty. Quijano reportedly charged over 100,000 pesos of incidentals at the hotel to Mr. Sharpe's account. While the authorities do nothing, they are squandering company resources.

Many employees are barred from entering site, most are afraid to. Monday, despite being forced off-site displaced management paid employee salaries by hand-delivering it to various groups in the area.

Mr. Sharpe has openly lied about their legal position and provided no documents to support their claims. Rather they are using stolen company documents to ""legalize"" their position. The facts cannot be avoided – armed men came under cover of darkness and forcibly seized the company and its property.

The incident is getting surprisingly little media coverage. There are rumors that local media has been paid to hush the story. However here are a few articles I could find:

Toxic Filipino Culture Rant: Dealing with Criticism by filing a libel case,"I've learned from my grade school that Crab mentality is one of the Filipino's toxic behavior, but we won't talk about it right now, I'm talking about how Filipinos handle criticism - by filing libel case.

Form showbiz news to political figures, laging may nakakasuhan ng libel, even before Duterte's reign of terror. There's countless article about that, you can Google this and find several results. 

It says a lot if you have to file a libel case to continue being a POS online, in office, and in general. There's a problem with the culture which enables this kind of toxic behavior. The simplest example would be the use of the term ""bashers"". Well for one I don't believe in such word, because I categorize naman online comments as either criticism, trolling, flaming, threats/harrassment, or just being an idiotic stan. Fuck that ad hominem, instead of taking criticism, maglalagay ng label na ""bashers"" instead of improving oneself. Because that simple ad hominem promotes a culture of intolerance towards anything negative, even slightest of negativity that is meant to help someone, and would result to people thinking it's okay to file lawsuits against their ""bashers"".

This kind of mindset help people such as Bong Go continue their abuse of power. And in younger generation, these kids would likely grow to support sensitive POS like Bato and Bong Go because apparently their lord and savior Makagago (MG) and Johah filed a lawsuit against a small YouTuber Nico David for his debunk videos. Nico merely discussed on how toxic those two content creators are, like how MG tell his followers to beat the crap out of ExB member (inciting physical assault on YouTube platform) and Jonah pranking his girl to the point that the girl started crying on camera by accusing her of stealing his sports car money. The audacity of these two to file lawsuit wherein sila dapat yung makasuhan. If kids looks up to these type of people online, we might see another generation supporting the likes of Bato and Bong Go.

They have won the battle against the Rappler head, but we should try to help people like the law student and Nico David wins their cases to protect our rights of free speech and end this cycle of corruption enabled by this toxic aspect of our culture. You can donate money, find them lawyers, and spread awareness on what those people has exposed like yung PH navy cruiser deal and yung antics nina Makagago to several people.

"I don't know if this is a valid feeling, but I'm wary about the Lopez oligarchs suddenly being whitewashed by the administration's threats to shut down ABS-CBN.","**I'm not a blind DDS kind of person and yes the government's done a lot of wrong**, but I can't help but feel like that with it threatening to shut down ABS-CBN, I suspect that this is—even unintentionally—going to put its owners, the Lopezes, in a much better light than they probably deserve credit for.

I mean surely the Lopezes aren't 100% clean and noble themselves, and the very fact that they're oligarchs with a vast fortune rather makes them not entirely innocent, either. You could argue that the shit creative quality of the teleseryes is one thing, though that's maybe the least of the problems—but it is true that shitty content is indirectly a result of ABS executives dismissing quality creative work and meddling in the story process, *in order to profit*. Then there's the more pressing issue of working conditions; I'm sure they're not above endo and other labour abuses, and the fact that teleseryes still run daily makes their crews suffer huge physical and mental stresses (isn't this why Eddie Garcia died and why people are scrambling to amend entertainment labour laws, because they lost one of their veteran moneymakers? This *is* a industry-wide problem though; I don't think he was working for ABS at the time he died?).

But the fact that people are already comparing the Lopezes' current situation with their expropriation by Marcos during Martial Law is only going to draw more supporters to their side, *even uncritical, unthinking supporters*. They're going to seem like underdogs again and *everyone loves an underdog*! Just like their ""benefactor"" Cory, just like a lot of LP people long afterward! It does seem like they're either playing the victim card, unintentionally or not.

And I'm also curious to know exactly, *objectively, what* *ABS actually is guilty of* that could be a cause for, if not shutdown or even buyout, at the very least serious review and restructuring. Is it true, for example, that they owe a lot of unpaid taxes? (Some of the DDS voices cite this as a reason, though it might be secondary to them being owned by pro-LP/""yellow"" oligarchs.)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/f88129/i_dont_know_if_this_is_a_valid_feeling_but_im/,t2_x0gi8,2020-02-23 18:54:35,2
"So, has anyone on the net actually READ the Anti-Terror Bill? [Discuss]","*Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer therefore my interpretations are that of a layman.*

Full text of SB 1083 can be accessed here: https://senate.gov.ph/lisdata/3163229242!.pdf

I stayed up a bit late last night to study and compare SB 1083 and the law it's trying to amend, the Human Security Act of 2007 or RA 9327. (Read here: https://pnl-law.com/blog/ra-9327-human-security-act-of-2007-full-text/).

The amendments itself are quite few, apparently the most contentious are:

> Removing the penalty for wrongful detention (PhP 500,000.00).

> Extending the detention period for suspected terrorists up from three (3) days up to ten (10) days max.

> Adding a clause (Sec. 9 - Inciting to Commit Terrorism) that penalizes ""[inciting] others to the execution of any of the acts specified in Section 4 hereof by means of speeches, proclamations, writings, emblems, banners or other representations tending to the same end, shall suffer the penalty of imprisonment of twelve (12) years.

*This appears to have been interpreted as a means to censor dissent both online or offline, including posting or sharing of memes deemed to ""incite"" terrorist acts"".*

> Penalizing recruitment to terrorist organizations (sec. 10) - ""Any person who shall recruit another to participate in, join, commit or support any terrorism or a terrorist individual or any terrorist organization, association or group of persons proscribed under Section 26 of this Act, or designated by the United Nations Security Council as a terrorist organization, or organized for the purpose of engaging in terrorism, shall suffer the penalty of life imprisonment without the benefit of parole and the benefits of Republic Act No. 10592.

*A common concern is that the definition of ""terrorism"" in the bill is vague, which may lead to abuse by tagging legitimate opposition as terrorist individuals or groups.*

These all may seem worrying enough, as trust towards public officials has significantly eroded due to the continued detention of suspected terrorists and drug personalities who have been vocal in opposing government policies or officials.

However, it is important to note that the definition of ""terrorist acts"" in both the Human Security Act of '07 and the current bill seems to remain almost virtually unchanged. Both include the following definitions:

(a) Engages in acts intended to cause death or serious bodily injury to any person, or endangers a person’s life; Engages in acts intended to cause extensive damage or destruction to a government or public facility, public place or private property:
(c) Engages in acts intended to cause extensive interference with, damage or destruction to critical in&astructure;
(d) Develops, manufactures, possesses, acquires, transports, supplies or uses weapons, explosives or of biological, nuclear, radiological or chemical weapons; and
e) Release of dangerous substances, or causing fire, floods or explosions

One striking difference between the older and proposed law is that the 2007 act does not include a clause protecting the right to dissent. The new anti-terror bill in fact excludes these acts from the definition of terrorism.

>terrorism as defined in this Section *shall not include* advocacy, protest, dissent, stoppage of work, industrial or mass action, and other similar exercises of civil and political rights, which are not intended to cause death or serious physical harm to a person, to endanger  person’s life, or to create a serious risk to public safety

Most of the exchanges online are mainly concerned with censorship and limiting the freedom of speech, whereas the older law from '07 vaguely hints at squashing opposition (the law itself refers to the provision in the Revised Penal Code that criminalizes rebellion or insurrection). 

If I am interpreting this correctly, the controversial bill includes *stronger* safeguards against potential abuse against civilians who are vocal in discontent against the government, which is disturbingly absent from the 2007 law.

There are also grave concerns with regards to wiretapping. Surprisingly, the existing law on Anti-Terrorism already *allows* wiretapping, with *no* specified time period (which could be interpreted as ""one day"" or ""for an indefinite period of time). Wiretapping requests by military officials require the Court of Appeals' approval, which is present in both bills.

Indeed, any act by the government that seemingly limits civil liberties should be viewed with suspicion, but I think it would be best to know more about the issue. Personally, I believe, given that the original Anti-Terror Bill seems even vaguer in its definition on what terrorism is, the current government *already* has the tools to prosecute anyone it deems as an affront to its grip on power.

Im planning to run away from home...,"So... Im 16 turning 17 years old this upcoming april and Im planning to run away from home and cut ties with my family... Heres a little background of me....

Im 13 when my father committed suicide... And ever since then things about our family started to fall deep down.... After my father's death my mother's beating stopped for a while, yes, for a while because Im already 15 when i realized that it actually never stopped and that she went to emotional abuse rather than physical, i started to realized it when she went away and become an OFW (abroad) to work, she says its for us (me and my sister) even though she usually complains when she sends money as if she really doesnt want too.... And now things are getting worst and worst while my mom is not here at home my sister which is younger than me, started going out and wont be going back until late night or she'll sneak out at the middle of the night to go to her boyfriend's (which changes every now and then) who basically doesnt even go to school properly, or wont be going home for days and will occasionally be ""running home"" to go to my aunt's who's just a few walks away from the house were staying in. And my relationship with my mom is much more distant than before, she refuses to talk to me and will be ending the call when the phone was passed to me... And will be bad mouthing me on our relatives, they all hate me now, they doesnt even want me to set foot on their house or to see me, she also always blames me on everything, like she blames me that im the reason why she doesnt want to go back ..... And Now, that I am 17 I got enough of it, I want to run away from home and never talk to them ever again, rather than walking the same path as my father did to himself....... Is there any advice you can give me? Someone? Please? 


Somethings I didnt mention above: •Me and my sister are both living on our own, but when she runs away and started sleeping to my aunt's.. it'll be just myself and my dog on the house... My grandma just checks me out sometimes but other than that,... Nothing
• Im now 16 turning 17 and my sister is now 15 when my mom left im 15 and shes 13..
• Between me and my sister im the only one who is always getting beaten up by her... And my father is the only one who i can lean on and he's only home for 3 months after 9 months of being on ship. (He's a marine/ seaman)... Even a little advice can help.... Im just really in need rightnow....

Edit: I got a little talk with my grandma today... And she slipped an information without me or her bringing up... That my mother practically run away -ed from me.... Well.... Shit I guess... Btw thank you for the advices I really appreciated it. Thank you thank you  thank youu and thank you for the time to read this emo post of mine and for the time to give advice to me thankk yoouuu... I'll be following alot of your advices of me staying here at this toxic house hold/ family until I turn legal and finish my studies even though my nmom just said that I cant enroll this year for school... So I'm planning to get a part-time and save some for school and finish it and then go incognito then of course to save money for myself for emergencies.....

Narcissistic Filipino mother wants to move with me to the US,"I barely have any positive, happy memories of my mother. From what I have researched, she either is a Covert Narcissist or has Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). Many of my memories of her are her being physically, emotionally, and verbally abusive to me. My father worked in the Middle East from when I was 4 years old and permanently returned when I was 16. Until then, I would only see him once a year, so my mother really ruled the roost. I'm the only child.

I understand that in our Filipino culture, corporal punishment towards children is ""somewhat acceptable."" I say this because from what I've noticed, some Filipinos still uphold this belief, and are quite proud of this as well. I experienced it all - midribs of the coconut leaf, kneeling on mung beans, belt buckle, chili peppers forced into my mouth but would often times get smeared all over my face and eyes, etc. Slippers were to weak for her.

I was punished for simple ""mistakes."" For example, on my first grade graduation, I refused to wear curlers. Apparently, being an honor student didn't matter to her because the curlers were of more importance that she beat the sh\*t out of me with her high heels only because I refused to curl my hair. Looking at my graduation pictures, I looked very sad and my eyes were very swollen.

One of the worst things that happened to me was when I was 6. I was beckoned by our landlord into his house (my mother was at home busy karaoke-ing and smoking with her younger sister and friends). This was where the abuse happened. I was too afraid to tell my mother that I never told her until 3 years later. But she didn't do squat. My parents didn't do squat. Often times, I would try to justify this that maybe they were too afraid, maybe there weren't enough resources at that time unlike today, maybe they didn't know who to run to, maybe they were embarrassed, maybe I told them too late, I don't know. All I know is none of them did squat. This topic sometimes comes up when my mother and I fight, but all she says is, ""you're so blessed now. Just move on with your life.""

I don't know how my mother was raised, but I'm sure she learned the sh\*t she did to me from somewhere. One of her brothers, my uncle, wrote a song for his middle child. He would ask her to sing this song over and over and if my cousin made a mistake, he would beat the sh\*t out of her. How could you beat your child for this reason? He does this kasi trip lang nya.

When I became a teenager, the physical beatings stopped, but her anger she expressed in other ways. The worst of them all was every time she was upset, she would wake my dad and I up to start havoc. She believes that if you purposely disrupt someone's sleep, this would upset them too much that they would be more inclined to listen to you. One night, she tried to wake me, so I pretended to not hear her and pretended to continue sleeping. She then picked up the remote control and repeatedly threw it on my head to wake me up. Often times, I would go to school groggy having been woken up the night before.

When I was in my mid 20s, I was already working, but still living with my parents. My cousin, who studying for the nursing board exam, moved in with us. My cousin and I were like sisters and were very close growing up. For some reason, my mother developed really strong affection towards my cousin and her anger towards me became stronger. This was probably because my cousin was more affectionate that I was, but then again, how can I be affectionate when she would always beat the crap out of me. My cousin would even ask why I seemed to always be the target of my mother's tantrums.

One day, my cousin was wearing super red shoes. I commented, ""Those are really red shoes!"" My cousin and I didn't think much of it, but this drove my mother insane thinking I was being critical of my cousin. She was so mad that she told me, ""You're just jealous because your cousin is prettier than you!"" Mind you, I never felt any jealousy towards my cousin. We were very close and often, there'd be some friendly banter between us.

Some time during that time, the movie ""New Moon"" premiered. None of my friends and co-workers could watch it with me and my cousin was the only one available, so we watched it together. My mother lost her sh\*t again. She accused me of seeing my cousin only because she believes I had intentions of backbiting her. None of this was true. My mother is so exhausting that talking about her with other people just never interested me.

For many years, I would repeatedly write the words, ""freedom"", ""emancipation"", etc. I really wanted to live on my own, far far away from my mother. I applied for jobs in Singapore and Australia, but none of them worked out. However, I believe I was still manifesting this in some way because in 2010, I landed a job in the US. Mind you, I never applied for this particular job. My employer just found my work online and invited me to work with them. It's almost like God or the universe found a way to remove me from the toxic household I was living in.

When I was getting all my US paperwork ready, we found out on my birth certificate that my parents weren't actually married. Apparently, my dad was married prior to marrying my mother (that he never filed annulment for), so their actual marriage was never valid to begin with. This catapulted my mother from being crazy to being absolutely batsh\*t insane.

When I moved to the US, she offered to help and stayed with me for 6 months. We would still often fight that one time, she locked me out of my own apartment. While I was so happy to get my own place, it still felt like I was walking on eggshells in my own home.

Just before I left the US, I purchased a condo in the city. I have been sending my mortgage ($500/mo) to my mother's bank account trusting her to pay my mortgage for me. This went on for \~4 years. One day, I got a call from my dad saying he's too tired of my mother pushing him to work. Apparently, my mother has been pocketing the money I've been sending her and she's been forcing my dad to pay for my condo mortgage. While my dad actually enjoys working because this forces him to leave the house and not have to see my mother's face every minute, the pressure from my mother was too much for him.

When I asked her about this, I tried to do in a non-confrontational way. I told her that I don't have a problem if she needed to use the money. What mattered to me is that she communicated this. But as always, she lost her sh\*t again to the point that she was almost hyperventilating. She tried to justify this, but eventually turned into victim mode - that I am trying to take away something that she enjoys (""managing"" my condo).

I really don't know why my mother seems to be so money-hungry. I remember when I was in high school, she would get so much anxiety if my dad's salary were a couple hours delayed. She would force me to call my dad's Finance Department to follow up and ask why my dad's salary is delayed. I remember being utterly embarrassed having to do this.

My parents have visited me almost every year here in the US, but every time my mom is in our house, there's always a lot of tension in the air. One time, she was crying uncontrollably because I apparently didn't ""invite her to dinner."" TBH, this was never intentional. I don't even have any recollection of this happening. But this was a time when I was almost going into labor, so there were a lot of things running through my head that I may have just eaten on my own and she happened to walk by. She told her relatives that ""we never invite her to eat"" and ""we deprive her of food."" Victim mode again. Like wtf. This couldn't be farther from the truth.

The other time they were here, we were fighting about something. My husband walked in on us and asked what was going on. I was so upset that I just told him, ""I don't know, I can't f\*ing deal with this"" and walked away. My mother twisted my words and launched a smear campaign against me. She texted her relatives and MY friends and told them I said ""f\*ck you"" to her.

Up to this day, even though she's so far away, we often fight. I limited my contact with her because it was stressing me out that I would sometimes snap on my own husband and young daughter. I'm very determined to end this generational trauma, but every time she calls me, she always says something that I find triggering. For example, she asked if she could move in with me and be given an allowance of $100 per week, so she can help around the house. I politely declined, but told her I can send her money when she needs it (I just sent her $1,500 to pay for her attorney fees). I told her we were on a budget which she then scoffed at and mocked.

Since I moved to the US, she's been asking to move in with me. She says that ""I'm the only child that refuses to sponsor their parent for a green card."" She's been blaming my husband - that it's my husband who is convincing me to disallow this.

I really want to forgive my mother, but I ABSOLUTELY CANNOT have her live with me. Her definition of us reconciling is me sponsoring her for a green card. I also can't really have an open, heart to heart, honest conversation with her because she just shuts me down, so nothing ever gets resolved. I'm afraid she will ruin the life and family that I built. Plus, I cannot afford it financially. Not only will my mother rely on me for healthcare, insurance, etc. (which I'll find ways to make it work if she were a loving and nurturing mother to begin with), but in addition to this, she demands to be paid $100/week or $500/mo in exchange for ""helping around the house.""

If I've noticed change in her, maybe I would reconsider, but so far during their visits here, she still constantly screams at my dad over trivial matters in front of my husband and daughter. The topic of my dad's first wife from over 40 years ago still constantly comes up. Every time I tell her to calm down, she says, ""this is their normal,"" so I shouldn't get all bent up. My husband and I never really fight. We made it a point that if one of us is upset, we always talk through it. So I'm very afraid that if she does move in with us, this will ruin our family and our peaceful home that we worked so hard for.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/133zmz8/narcissistic_filipino_mother_wants_to_move_with/,t2_99h5dut0,2023-05-01 02:44:34,13
What could be the possible charges against a mistress? Or the De Facto wife to file against the scandalous (De Jure) ex wife?,"I met my partner at the time, he has been separated from his ex wife for more than three years.. and also the ex having a partner which she lives with. Their separation started when the ex left their marital dwellings and had arrange their partition of properties…Almost 3/4 of their properties was with her and the ones left are of my partner’s, the house from his ancestral address, others and the custody of the kids. Their separation and arrangement has find my consideration of staying with him… I would never enter a relationship coniving if it has a present one.. knowing his status got my approval. The court stated they were annulled last year… but the only thing is… I am starting to worry about his ex doing a lot of convincing him with so much finance…. esp loans and businesses..even by her means she can be able to hand support separately and I clearly understand about the support for their common children. I never ever touch, intervene or use any of their existing properties. I knew my place so well… 

I came to know she has planned to file concubinage against me but she did not pursue it because it would implicate my partner which fathered her kids and will disturb his financial support if she file it againts us… and she has less chance of winning the case because of my reputation and the property were we are staying are already of my partner’s as what was said in partition agreement. 

And for Child abuse as I admit there were some misunderstandings between me and her daughter knowing the kid and the Mom had plot it…to intentionally provoke me and all of those times I only raised my voice but never my hands on them, never a single physically act, raising my voice because they are wrong in the first place..they are for answering and disrespecting someone older than them..I even wonder she have to? I don’t get it what could be greener in our side? Where in fact almost all is with her. If she really wants the kids with her she could have work on that long before…and O even ask the kids if they want to transfer at their mom’s but they don’t want to live with her. 

I fulfilled my obligation as a second parent. I know they are Not my own but as a.m adult living them I keep them safe irregardless of their behavior sometimes and feed them many Times a day and look after the immediate needs.

I understand that my partner choose his kids the most than taking more than from their partition. I see his Love for them and I do support it. I was never a problem in doing granting favours if the mother wishes to spend Time with them no matter when and How long… she knew i’m the type who’s not hard to speak with even if it means she wants him back. 

I must say… I may be sorry for being that part for what she left and after I came in to his life only to support what I can and never assume any of I a.m not suppose to. 

I a.m just worried..looking for answers that I have to keep myself safe from this prideful, insecure and bitter woman.. 

I pitty her from the anger she can’t let go…or wanting too much everything but I pitty myself more not knowing what can she file against me…Sorry to ask or share my side here..was really planning to seek a legal advise but worry if someone sees me….I a.m planning to do it for my safety. Legally I am aware I a.m the mistress as their annulment is yet to be issued for finallity.. I a.m confident that I a.m my partner’s De facto wife or common law wife. And will protect what ever my boundaries are and for her to prevent from crossing it. 

I appreciate if you guys advise me…and just share any thoughts on my situation will make my day temporarily lighter..",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/ttxqnu/what_could_be_the_possible_charges_against_a/,t2_gd6tap3w,2022-04-02 02:23:45,2
"Sorry, but I think the internet is indeed a factor why many people are ""depressed"" right now, BUT that's not necessarily a bad thing.","So I saw this short clip on Facebook. Galing siya sa isang film featuring Tony Labrusca. Tony told her mom he's depressed, and the mom went ballistic, saying shits like depression is just a trend online.

While I don't believe that depression is a trend, I do think the internet is also a reason why more and more middle-class people claim they're depression. Sa palagay ko, ito ay parehong panget at mabuti -- pero mas matimbang ang mabuti kesa panget.

Let's talk about why is it a bad thing first. Simple lang: some people might misinterpret this validation, and rather than dealing with their pains, they became addicted to it and became their sort of comfort. Kumbaga, the internet validation became a new form of addiction -- gaya ng kung bakit may mga nalululong sa online games, pagkain, at droga. I've observed this a lot in the West. Halimbawa nga, some of them gets offended with the word ""fat"" or ""obese"". Dapat daw plus-size or the new sexy ang tawag para di masakit sa pandinig. See? Rather than dealing with their insecurity, they resorted to demonizing an adjective, and that's a bad thing. Nagiging eggshell na ang mga tao, all for the sake of not offending someone who has issues.

Now, let's talk about the good thing.

Syempre, unang-una dyan ang validation ulit. Gaya rin ng pagkain, online games, and even drugs, wala naman talagang masama sa validation *as long as* you know your limit. Most of you probably already know sugar is addicting, and is probably more addicting than marijuana, but hey, we don't hear people asking to ban sugar. Even nutritionists themselves aren't saying that. Ang lagi lang nilang sinasabi ay hinay-hinay lang. If you consumed it moderately, sobrang helpful iyon sa katawan mo especially if you're physically active.

Ganoon din sa validation. Maraming middle class/rich kid na lumaki sa toxic positivity mindset. Because of this, their frustrations were forced to repress simply because someone had it worse. Pinagdaanan ko rin ito, sa totoo lang. My grandma loves to tell me na swerte ako dahil marino si Papa at malaki ang sahod kaya hindi ko naranasan maghirap noon. Anong naging epekto sakin? I was forced to conceal my angsts. Dahil hindi ko mailabas, naipon lang nang naipon sa dibdib ko. Parang naging time bomb siya, and it exploded in 2019, after my break-up with my long-term boyfriend. I felt so miserable. I'm still dealing with numbness and suicidal ideation until now. Mabuti na lang, I have a good support group. Gusto ko sanang mag-therapy pero ayoko kasi ng epekto ng gamot sakin, so I chose not to seek it.

What could have happened if iba ang upbringing ko? I probably would have a better coping mechanism. Right now, my coping mechanism is being workaholic, since it helps me distract myself from pain, pero hindi rin maganda ito. Dami ko ngang pera pero di naman ako masaya sa buhay ko. That's why right now, I'm learning to balance my social life and work. Heck, pati sex life and fitness, I'm slowly incorporating it to my lifestyle.

Isa pang bagay na maganda sa awareness ng mental health online ay yung mapuputol na natin ang siklo. Let's admit it, one of the reasons why the Gen Xers and the generation earlier romanticized hard work and abuses so much is because ganoon sila pinaniwala. Kaya nga karamihan sa mga toxic boss at customer ay mga galing sa henerasyon na ito. Karamihan sa kanila ay mayroong anger management issue. Naalala ko nga sa first job ko, I was bullied by my workmates, who are mostly 40+ and older. Natutuwa kasi boss namin sakin dahil mabilis ako magtrabaho, and these people saw me as a threat, so they're bullying me through cold treatment. Tapos lagi pa akong pinagchichismisan, at hindi rin ako sinasabihan kapag may announcement. It’s affecting my job a lot. So iyon, umalis ako after six months. Nagalit si Tita ko sakin, saying I should just shrug it off. Imagine, rather than saying ang toxic ng ka-work ko, ako pa ang mali? But then, iyon kasi ang kinagisnan nilang buhay.

Through the MH awareness, the younger generation can break this cycle. We learn to be kinder and be less tolerant to bullshit like this, and I think that’s the best part. After all, bukod sa mali naman talaga ang bullying, counterproductive din ito, lalo na sa office. Halimbawa na nga lang itong experience ko sa first work ko. Natutuwa si Boss sakin because I’m efficient. That efficiency decreased because of the bullying. Remember, from an economic perspective, productivity loss will also result in income loss, which sadly many insecure coworkers didn’t know. Hindi lang ako ang apektado kundi ang kumpanyang pinagtratrabahuhan nila. In the long run, sila rin ang maapektuhan sa ganitong kultura.

And speaking of efficiency, MH awareness also improves it. Think about it: hindi ka makakapagtrabaho nang matino kung burnt out ka, hindi ba? And this is NOT just anecdotal evidence. Years ago, Microsoft Japan conducted a study to know what would happen if they implement a 4-day work system. Japan is notorious for their overworking culture, so this is frowned upon. And surprisingly, mas malaki pa ang income nila during the time 4-day work happens. Mas productive ang mga tao dahil hindi sila masyadong pagod. Hindi rin uso yung pinapabagal ang trabaho para lang mapagkasya ng eight hours ang pwede sanang gawin within 3-4 hour. And nakatipid pa sila sa operating expenses dahil tatlong araw na walang gumagamit ng office. See? Efficient, and it all started because Microsoft is trying to improve the mental health state of their employees.

The verdict? The Internet does play a factor on why more people are self-diagnosing. But if you think about it, the benefits outweigh the liability. Hindi lang natin natutulungan ang mga tao, but it would also improve the economy. It’s a win-win suggestion.

Recommendation? Normalize validating your pain, but don’t overdo it as it would lead to addiction in the long run.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/oco9gn/sorry_but_i_think_the_internet_is_indeed_a_factor/,t2_c29brq68,2021-07-03 09:31:28,44
A Word from the Frontline,"Warning: long post ahead due to context.

I just got my license last October and opted for a year off. I was tired, I didn’t feel like I was ready for residency, and I definitely had plenty of personal issues that needed sorting out.

Let it not be said that med school is an ordeal in on itself.  

The boards were just the icing on the cake; and what a sour tasting icing it was. 

I digress.

When I said “take a year off”, I simply mean that I wanted to stretch out on my own, finally do NON MED related things Ive been keeping off the table for so long, and still keep sharp the skills and knowledge I’ve gained—yes, by working as a licensed physician.

After all, a boy’s got to eat. 

Serendipitous as it may seem, a few days after the announcement of the board passers, there was an opening in a public hospital near where I lived. The pay was considerable, the schedule (24 ++ hour duties notwithstanding) was alright and there was a chain of referral present. Since it was a specialist hospital I (theoretically) did not need to worry about certain cases.

While adulting was hard (literal na parang itatae kayo sa kalsada about the many intricacies of life that med school never bothered to even mention—unless you had a job before med), it was a minor irritation. Lesson learned pa din and it definitely won’t do to be charged for tax evasion. 

The first few months were fun; if more hectic than I assumed it would be. The chain of command was surprisingly supportive unlike what was experienced by some of us during clerkship and/or internship. While I did my best, I still made a few mistakes—unsurprising as this was the first real time I’d be managing things on my own.

Not once was I lambasted nor abused, and for that I was grateful. Constructive criticism and proper advise is so much better than the petty powertripping that seems so rampant in medicine—training or otherwise. 

Skills remained sharp, I got to know great new people and explored my horizons both professional and personal in ways I don’t think residency would ever let me.

Call me pretentious, but maybe for some, it really is better to learn how to fly first before you walk. 

Also, it really is something else to FINALLY be earning for yourself and be able to give a bit in return to those who have supported you the whole time.

All good things must come to an end; or as Ned Stark more fittingly put, “Winter is coming.” 

Come late December, everyone seemed to be happy, still so full of Christmas cheer when there came news that in China, never-before-seen pathogen has begun infecting people.

It didn’t seem like a big deal at the time, but it helped to keep tabs. Soon enough, the virus we now call SARS CoV 2 which causes COVID 19 was on the news everyday. Soon, there were clamors to suspend flights to and from China and other affected areas. Temporary naman, just until the crisis abates. 

I’m pretty sure a lot of you have seen the news on that last January-early Feb. 

And then it started.

At first, they were either foreign nationals here for a vacation or for whatever other purpose or OFWs, having come from a high risk country with fever, cough and/or colds.

Fever, cough and/or colds. 

As simple as they may sound, the sheer number of pathogenic entities that can cause any or all of these is simply mind-boggling. This is where history-taking and physical examination comes in. It was often said that 95% of the time, a doctor can get it right simply through those. 

Lies kill, and we would learn how true those words are in due time. 

Going back, the lab exams, radiologic imaging etc are there not to diagnose for us, but to act as supporting evidence. They serve to identify what the pathogen is (for us to give specific treatment if need be), to see if the patient is getting better (hence repeat testing for a lot of illnesses), and to see if there is anything new needs to be addressed. That’s the remaining 5%. 

So yeah, it was a trickle at first. 

Manageable. Or so it seemed. 

That trickle soon turned into a stream; regular hospital protocol simply wouldn’t do anymore so the admin made drastic changes.

Effectively, the hospital I worked in became a specialty center for COVID 19 with those changes.

Our job? The vanguard. The frontline.

Before anyone thinks it’s unfair and too risky, our seniors had the far riskier job of actually handling the day-to-day issues of inpatients INCLUDING those who have turned out positive.

We adjusted. We made our pleas for compensation heard, and at the very least we were given what was due. Hopefully, that fairness stays that way for the duration. 

Having done my internship in the biggest public hospital myself, the eventual frontline seemed a familiar sight. 

The major difference was the fear.

Fear spreads faster and goes deeper than any other plague can. 

It started with that report about the first locally transmitted case of COVID 19. Suddenly the people came non-stop, some outright demanding to be tested despite being told and being shown the guidelines that we follow.

To placate such people is a balancing act in being professional and in keeping one’s temper down. It is immensely tiring for mind, body and spirit to do so on a repeated basis. 

As of right now, the most at risk seem to still be the old and/or those with debilitating chronic illnesses. They are the ones who should be tested and admitted if need be.

There are no guidelines for VIP testing. God forbid the day there would be.

We had to swallow the bile, seeing the pompous and entitled put themselves first before the people they had sworn to serve. 

Heck, ‘til now, none of the medical staff in the hospital have ever been swabbed. 

The reality that we and the other staff members were but lowly ants that can only serve and not be heard (at least not out loud) was not missed. Even our seniors who had a negative opinion on the matter had no choice. 

Rizal once stated it so graciously in the character of Kabesang Tales and the friars who deigned on his rights and what he knew was just.

“Siya ang palayok, kawali ang korporasyon.”

Go figure. 

That stream soon turned into a river; more changes were wrought in our line of work. More struggles.

More. More. More. 

Our seniors had to pull off alternating shifts; that is to say they go on 24++ hour duties every other day, supposedly to keep their immunities up. It does little to lessen the risk of their contracting the virus which by that point had caused all of Luzon to be locked down by the increasingly erratic President. 

Most of us juniors couldn’t risk going home. Our parents were and continue to be at risk. They are getting on with years and if they were to get sick, then science—objective and simultaneously emotionless—dictated that they were most likely to suffer severe manifestations. The communities where we come home too will also suffer thanks to the draconian measures we are all forced to live with. 

At the very least, the hospital admin gave us lodging and food, and we are grateful for the good samaritans who have and continue to help out in what ways they can. I cannot say the same for other healthcare workers from other institutions. 

Each day brings more patients, and each day the atmosphere becomes more rife with fear or so it seems. The number of cases is rising daily. The risk of contracting the disease (or any such similar ones) is a constant companion especially for we who actually have to handle patients. The risk is probably similar too for any such patient who decides to get checked in our now-densely packed institutions by simple proximity. 

Remember; droplet transmission has an effective radius of 6 feet. 

One cough. One sneeze. A lot of people. 

That’s all it would take. 

Outside the hospital, the news still leaves a lot to the imagination, but what is shown seems to reflect a similar condition. 

It’s morbidly interesting how a virus is all it would take to lay bare the many, many faults and inadequacies of the system we follow and are forced to endure.

Rather than lead with a sense of gravity and purpose, we get sad excuses, senseless statements (e.g. “The Kit”) and many such other examples. 

Instead of a medical solution, we get a militaristic one. Hell, a lot of these soldiers probably don’t have adequate training (if at all) 
for an epidemic. The masks most of them wear are about as useful as tissue paper against SARS CoV 2. One can hardly blame them for that kind of ignorance at least. It is the possibility of abuse of power that keeps heads turning and fingers crossed.

Such abuse has happened before after all, lest we forget. 

What is incredible is that some people have the gall to defend these measures without being offered enough aid nor explanation. Instead “Ano bakit? May naiambag ka ba? Sumunod ka na lang kasi <expletive>” has become a de facto reason if you can even call it that.

I digress again. 

The frontline sees us and our fellow healthcare workers exposed in more ways than one. I am lucky that our institution seems to have enough for our staff which number few to begin with. We make do with what limited manpower we have because we don’t have a choice.

For the larger institutions (public and private), I’ve seen and heard from friends also on the frontline how they have to improvise simply due to a shortage of stocks that those in power are supposed to provide. Manpower too is fast becoming a problem; even old doctors and nurses who shouldn’t pull such long shifts anymore are forced to take the field despite the higher risk they have due to the curse of age. 

The virus (and the menagerie of other microbes in the workplace) is not the only thing we are exposed to; healthcare workers have to grind too for a living, just like anyone else. Work from home is never an option. Imagine during the first few days of the lockdown, not a single fig it seemed was given regarding the problem of commuting to and from the workplace or alternatively where they can stay to limit exposure. 

Contrary to what most think, nobody gets rich by working in healthcare alone. Most of us don’t have cars too. Before the present transpo measures were placed, each institution had to think of ways on how to manage an otherwise crippling problem. 

Sari-sariling diskarte in other words. Imagine that. 

It’s even more harrowing now to know some of these healthcare workers have been thrown out like the lepers of old by paranoid landlords who consider them harbingers of disease. 

Mind you, healthcare workers are among those supposed to have a pass to go to and from their place of work for obvious reasons. We have a hard enough time with what’s going on. 

Misinformation and paranoia only make it more difficult and dangerous for everyone. 

What more for the common Filipino who holds no exemption? I’ve felt helpless whenever a patient has asked me how they’re supposed to go home or to pay for private services. I have no true answer nor remedy for that. 

Compound those with the previously existing problems we have in our healthcare system.

Most, if not all of us, have families; and the possibility of never seeing them again is always around the corner. As I write this, a total of 10 doctors, most of whom had been in the high risk age group, have perished due to COVID 19. It is a reminder of mortality; a reminder that not everyone can be saved. 

Forget that a lot of frontliners are relatively young. 

We die too. 

The ones in charge of running the country, flaccid as they are, seem to think that the death of one is a tragedy, the death of a million is a statistic. 

I do hope I am proven wrong in that regard. 

The personal toll is no less painful, perhaps even moreso; for patients and those whose lives have been forfeit, most of all. 

There are dreams now that may never be realized, loves that may never again come alive. There are roads in life closed mayhaps forever; not just for we in the vanguard, but for anyone who holds such hopes. 

It makes one think of what could have been avoided simply by imposing those would-be travel bans. Alas, it appears that we have been in damage control ever since. 

While we (healthcare workers—no, Mr. Cayetano, sit down) stand united in trying to stem the torrent, it is unsurprising and most unfortunate that even we are bickering and arguing about what to do next. 

Then again, we’re people too. We have flaws too. 

I’ve said previously, we die too. There are at least ten names now that can attest to that. 

We are also afraid. 

But we can’t choose to show that. 

We want answers from above, same as everyone. When we make ourselves heard, there are consequences that follow. Many such answers given too are not all assuring and leaves many a question to boil in a fevered mind. 

Forgive the comparison, but some of us do feel like soldiers being made to go to war without arms. 

We can only hope that everyone does their part. 

Is this a war we can win? 

Certainly.

But we can’t win it alone",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/fs8rql/a_word_from_the_frontline/,t2_24watoxo,2020-03-31 15:46:08,139
Pagpalo sa mga bata. Tama nga ba?,"Proud to say I'm a battered child. Here's my story goes.

My Grandpa was a retired military officer. Sobrang strict niya sa mga anak niya. Pero yun Papa ko once lang napalo. Lahat nga mga brothers and sister niya literal na mata lang walang latay. Pero sa lahat ng magkakapatid, yun Papa nag-adapt nun gruesome method ng "" palo "" . And to make the story much interesting, amplified version yun discipline niya.

Almusal, tanghalian, merienda, minindal, siesta, dinner, at midnight snack buntal naransan ko lahat. And to think na disciplined na kami, munting pagkakamali lintik na buntal ang kapalit.

2nd ako sa magkakapatid. I have my ate and yun brother kong sumunod sakin. Lahat kami binili ng mga wristwatch na synchronized yun time sa relo niya. Di ka pwedeng magdahilan about the battery if ma-late kasi weekly checked niya if ok pa yun battery nun relo. Eto sample rules and the punishment we received.
 1.Bawal ma-late ng uwi. Not even a minute. Sabay sabay dapat kakain and nakatoka yun mag-sasay ng grace before we eat. Minsan na late ako ng uwi ( project sa school ), sa takot kong mabuntal. Sinama ko classmates and teacher ko. Nakatayo na sa may front door si Papa, and when my teacher explained yun reason. Lumabas ng gate Papa, no uttered words. Kinulyaran ako, sabay batok ng malakas, subsob ako sa front door namin, instant spaghetti sauce yun labi ko nun tumama dun sa handle. Di na naka-imik teacher ko. Isa lang sinabi ni Papa nun. Next time teacher wag niyo ng ihahatid to ha. Ako ng susundo sa kanya. Kala ko tapos na appetizer lang pala yun. ( happened when I was in grade 2 )
 
Punishment... Pag-upo ko para kumain, ayun habang kumakain ka, binabatukan ka. Tapos you will see your mother, walang magawa para tulungan ka. She can only shed tear. Tsk awang awa ako sa sarili ko nun. To make things worst. I have offended another rule while being punished dun sa pagiging late ko.
 1.Pag-kakain, dapat kain lang. Kailangan "" clean plate "". Since binabatukan ako dahil nga na-late ako. Ayun may nahulog na grain of rice out of my plate. When I was about to pick it up. ' Blammmm "" sa lakas nun batok sakin, subsob nanaman yun face ko sa plate ko. And he literally, send the plate flying so lahat nun laman nun sumabog na sa sahig.
 
Punishment... I have to put my hands behind my back and eat every last bit of food sa sahig. Talo ko pa manok sa pagkain kasi patapos na sila kumain dapat matapos na din ako. That time pag-uminit na ulo ni Papa, di na siya kakain and di ka niya tatantanan. Di ka maktulog nun when you are sent to bed, and to console me sa nangyari, in the middle of the night, alam ni Mama na umiiyak ako. She will only go to our room just to kiss me in my forehead, and away she goes. Gusto ko siya tawagin and beg to stay with me until I fell asleep, kaso di pwede. Paga na yun labi ko and sobrang hapdi na.
 1.Bawal maging hero. Since I consider yun araw araw na sinturon, lahat ng klase ng walis and hanger ay minor lang. I will narrate nalang yun worst whoppin'. Basta konting mistake very little lang talaga, gulpi ka na agad, kasi who would dare na gumawa ng kalokohan kung ang kapalit nun eh a week of recovery. back to rule#3. One time, thesis ng Ate ko, she was late for dinner. Like the rule stated above buntal din siya. Ayun pinunit yun report niya, the thesis itself. Almost a month work ni Ate napunit lang in an instant. Tapos habulang buntal ang naganap. Di ko na matiis, since sa lahat ng magkakapatid na-immune nako sa sakit ng katawan, sa buntal, sa gulpi, sa bugbog. Nun nakahawak ng antique chair si Papa para ibato sa Ate ko since ambilis niya tumakbo, 'alam kong tatamaan yun sis ko. Ayun, ako humarang. Sobrang sakit and ramdam na ramdam ko nun tumama sa shoulder blade ko yun upuan. Di ko magalaw right arm ko. Next thing I knew.
 
Punishment... Ayun sabi sakin "" Ah, gusto mo ikaw ang masaktan ha? Bibigyan kita ng sakit "". Parang sinentensyahan nako ng deathrow nun. Dinibdiban ako, sikmura, and that time highschool nako. May batuta siya, gift from Grandpa. Yun lumang batuta, PC daw yun eh ( Philippine Constabulary ) yun ang hinataw sakin. Bawal tumakbo, bawal umiyak or umatungal. Di ko kayang maluha, hirap pigilin. Magaling pumalo si Papa. dahil di kita mga pasa ko pag suot ko school uniform. so yun pasa ko, korteng uniform. Pag nakahubad ako, parang naka-polo ako na kulay blue violet.
 1.I forgot na yun reason kung bakit ako nabuntal. Since very minor lang talaga para maalala ko pa yun dahilan. Pero here's one of the worst punishment.
 
Punishment... Siguro napagod na yun kamay kabubuntal kasi nakita niya na hindi nako nasasaktan. One time sabi niya..."" Lumayas kana, at pag lumabas ka na ng gate. Kalimutan mo ng anak kita at wag na wag ka ng babalik...Alis!!!"" quote and un-quote. So ako natuwa na, palabas nako. confident ako na maraming kukupkop samin kasi nga yun mga kapit-bahay namin awang awa samin kapag naririnig yun buntalan moments. And since sobrang sipag namin, raised and born in military way. Lahat ng gawin namin magkakapatid, we have to make sure it has to be perfect or else...kaya respeto sa nakakatanda, ingat sa mga gamit and toys 9 we barely play our toys kasi onting gasgas, or may maputol an kamay or ulo ( lego ) tsk tsk, alam na. back to the story, I was about to exit our front door. Bigla akong sinigawan, "" Pu%8#!na ka!!!, san ka pupunta ka? "" ngali-ngali kong sabihin na "" Ah, eh sa labas po...pinapalayas niyo po ako diba? "" pero siyempre..ala komiks mode na enclosed lang sa ulap yun thoughts na yun kundi sasabog nanaman nguso ko. Sabi sakin.."" Ipinanganak ka ng Mama mo ng walang damit, aalis ka sa pamamahay ko ng walang dala na kahit na ano."" Gusto ko ng mamatay that time. ( grade 6 ) ako nun, tuli nako pero pano ako lalabas ng naka-hubo?

The event happened when there was a heavy rainfall. Liliw yun place namin and if anyone has ever been there, mataas yun lugar na yun and the little cozy town was previously called "" little baguio "". So sobrang lamig that time, freezing cold plus the rainfall. No choice ako, so tanggal damit. Tinira ko brip ko, I was about to open the handle...biglang... "" Nakakaintindi ka ba? Pag sinabi kong hubo..HUBO!!! "" and believe me, it wasn't even a shout. It was roar, roar from hell. Yun tipong send chills to your bones. Ayun, hubo mode nako. Siyempre ayoko lumabas. That happened around 12:30 pm. Nun elem days eh, we had to go home to eat our lunch then balik ng school. So if lalabas ako, bukod sa lamig and ulan na malakas...makikita ako for sure ng mga kaklase ko. 

"" Labas!!! "" and that was out. I was out cold and I ran and ran. Nakapikit ako, I was praying na pagdilat ko, panaginip lang lahat pero hindi. Good thing 20-25meters across sa house namin ay bakanteng lote with wild grass that stood approximately 3ft. Ayun nagtago ako behind da bushes. No trees to shed me from the rainfall. My hands and feet went numb sa sobrang lamig. I closed my eyes and prayed na maging ibon nalang ako ( kaya naiiyak ako dun sa Forrest Gump, yun scene with Jinny, childhood bestfriend niya na inaabuso nun dad, she prayed to have wings ) or maging hayop nalang ako, mabura na lahat ng memory ko. Grabe mga tumatakbo sa isip ko nun that time. As I kept my eyes closed, I heard a voice. Like an angel's. When I opened my eyes, ayun sumambulat sakin. Two of my girl classmates. To make the story worst, yun isa crush ko. Nun nakita ko sila, they are both crying, naaawa siguro. Lam na kasi sa school yun pambubugbog samin so alam nila na parusa yun sakin. Yun crush ko di nagsasalita, nakatingin lang siya sakin, sa katawan ko.. hehehe...that time todo yupyop ako para di makita yun tweety bird ko ( sobrang lamig kasi eh, what do you expect )

The other girl her name is Kristine, she told me na "" Huy, sama kana samin. Uwi ka sa bahay. May damit don. may pagkain. Dun kana muna magpalipas ng ulan, kami na bahala kay Ma'am ( teacher ). "" Gusto ko na ayaw ko. pano ko tatayo? grade 6...tsk tsk..sabi ko umuna nalang sila and baka makita pa sila ni Papa, madamay pa sila. So on they went. Worst day and night of my life. I fell asleep, siguro sa gutom, and lamig. Ayun, sight na di ko malilimutan till this very day, I saw my Mom held a flash light and heading towards my location. She brought a blanket, nun makita ako, napahawak nalang siya sa bibig niya. Trying to hide her sobs. Ayun lang sabi niya "" Halika na Anak, tulog na Papa mo "" T'was 9pm. Taas na ng lagnat ko. I recovered after a week, ayun back to buntalan moments nanaman for such tiny mistakes. mahal na mahal ako ng Papa ko... 

Even nun college, ligaw moments na. Bugbog sarado kapag late muwi dahil sa GF. Up until now she still remember na ako yun di mapakali kapag nanliligaw ako sa kanya. I sue to tell her na.."" Una nako ha, talo ko pa kasi si Cinderella , pag nalate ako eh yun mukha ko magiging kalabasa sa pasa "" Pag na-late ready na katawan ko sa bugbugan blues. The next day, pag punta ko kila GF. She use tend to my wounds. Sabi ko ok lang yun...minsan kapag trouble sa school. Ayaw na makipag-away sakin kasi nga kapag nakikipagsuntukan ako, yun parang wala nakong paki-elam. Di nako nasasaktan eh, yun pananakit nila eh wala ng epekto or hindi ko na na-fee-feel yun pag-inflict nila ng physical damage. Tapos all-out ako makipag-basagan ng mukha. Buti nalang la naging mga peklat sa mukha ko...

My Dad was proud only at one thing, di siya nagagalit na malalaman niya na nakipagsuntukan ako, pag uwi ko he sees my face bruised, lips are cut. He'll only ask one thing. "" Nasaktan ka? siguraduhin mong nasa tama ka. Labhan mo na yan damit mo, magagalit nanay mo pag nakitang may dugo yan "" and this was grade3 or grade 4.

Madami pang story ang nangyari until nun college nako. We were asked to write an essay. Madaming topic to choose from pero isa yun pinili ko. "" The most memorable person ""

Typically, I should have wrote my mom. Pero instead I wanted to be different. I wrote my dad instead. The composition of the letter was very ironic. I wrote halos kapareho nun post ko dito lahat nun pambubugbog niya, pero nilagay ko sa latter part nun letter. Never akong nagalit or nag-rebelde sa Dad ko. But I always kept on asking one and always the same question...."" Why?""

nilagay ko yun irony nun mga ginawa sakin like...

through tears I learn to smile through pain I learn to love through hate I learn compassion through the bruises I learn to hug and make people smile through the cuts I learn to care and to mend broken hearts

things like that yun sinulat ko sa last part. And my dad thus made me this way, I'll never forget him and he's the most memorable person. Who molded me, creating me of who I am.

Balewala sakin yun, gusto ko lang isulat yun past ko. Tapos di ko one day, our Prof came into our room with tears in her eye. She told us about the essay she asked us to do. Eh gags ako nun sa school. I teased pa na ang cheesy naman nun nagpaiyak kay Ma'am. She then blurted out my name and yun piece ko. She ask me to read it in front of the class. Natatawa pa ko and reasoned na Ma'am seryoso kayu? So ayun, no choice but to read it, Read it as fast as I could, I put no feelings when I read out the words. Nun matatapos na, saw my fellow students...teary eyed. Upo lang ako, and my Prof asks for my permission if she could get a copy. sabi ko no prob. Ayun ang dami nila nagpa-photocopy, mostly mga babae. Di pa natapos story nun, paguwi ko ng bahay, a month passed ata. when I was about to leave our house for another week for school ( sa manila nako nag-cocollege that time ) my dad held my shoulders and said... "" May naiwan ka na yellow pad, assignment niyo ata "" isip ako ng sip kung anu yun until he said na "" Memorable person yun title "".. he looked into straight into my eye, as if he has seen my soul. Gusto kong pumikit that time and sabi ko patay, the worst thing could ever happened already did happened. He then said softly.. "" h'wag ka umalis, mag-uusap tayu...""

My Dad told me to stay for the day, and ok lang daw na umabsent ako sa class. Di ko lam kung ano dapat maramdaman ko that time. Pinagpapawisan ka ng butil butil na malamig, kahit maaliwalas naman ang panahon. He then ask me to buy "" Lambanog "" and some pulutan. That time ang tumatakbo sa isip ko, na iinom siya mag-isa and pagna-reach na yun super saiyan level saka ako hahagupitin, dahil dun sa pesteng essay na yun na hindi ko lam how the hell he obtain that?? I prepared my body for the torture of my life. And there he was, we have a bahay kubo at our backyard, I got the drinks and then he called me up. It wasn't even a call, more of like a "" pakiusap "". he told me. "" Halika dito, maguusap tayu. "" First time I've heard that tone of voice, it was very meek. Aaminn ko, that time mas napraning ako dahil iba yun mood niya. Di ko lam kung paglapit koba eh, bigla nalang ako hatawin nun bote or what. Very cautious ako that time. Di ako umiimik. Then he spoke. "" Inom tayung dalawa. "" First time he ever asked me to have a sitdown with him. One on one. Miinom nako that time, pero not with him. Not that kind of setting. He told his life story, how he was raised up when he was a child. Ako yun nag-tatagay that time. Gusto ko talaga dayain. Ayokong magulpi ng naka-inom ako, di ko lam magiging reaction ko. I was afraid na baka gumanti ako pag binira ako, pero mas natakot ako kasi for sure pag nakainom ako, di ako makakailag sa uppercut, jab, roundhouse and sa fatality. Parang mortal kombat lang. The conversation went smooth, hours have passed. My mom watches us from a distance, maybe preaparing for a bloodbath. I was surprised my Dad, forgot na yun essay thing... 

But I was wrong. He reached down to his pocket. Pulled out th letter. Stared at me. And then asked me to read it. My mom rushed and sat right next to me. My angel my guradian. Thought came passing through my head, I am saved. 

My Dad told my Mom, "" Makinig tayu. "" Inabot na niya yun well-folded na yellow pad. And then I read it. May part dun na sinadya kong hindi basahin. How can I read it? Andun yun "" memorable person "" sa harap ko. Kapag binasa ko yun, 100% yun ang magiging "" memorable gulpi "" ko. My father spoke, gulat na gulat ako. When I skipped a sentence. he told me.. "" Basahin mo lahat, gusto kong marining lahat. Every word you wrote. Read it. ""... I froze and pumasok na sa isip ko that time. He already read it, probably over and over. La nakong magagawa I have to fully read it. I heard my mom crying. I found myself tears falling down my eye. When I made the letter, I made that out of sadness. Emotions came rushing in. And when I read the final words. I looked up at my Dad. His eyes kept closed. I saw tears falling from the corners of his eyes.

Is this a dream? I came to question myself? Siguro I was drunk??

My Dad spoke, his voice was trembling. His eyes still closed. "" The sweetest words I could hear from my son. I never dreamed that I will live the day to hear these words. "" He opened his eyes and said... "" Maraming salamat...anak. I want you to read that sa burol ko. Kapag namatay ako, I want everybody to know what kind of a father I was. "" The most sad thing I ever heard from him. Masahol pa yun naramdaman ko nun nakipag-break up yun GF ko. My heart was shattered. I don't want to see that, I don't want to hear those words from him. Mga profanity, mga pagmumura niya sakin...that I can endure pero yun words na he told me. How he felt bout the letter. I wish I hadn't wrote it. My father's words broke my heart apart. My fear pala is I don't want to see my Dad in pain. Seconds passed, pero it felt like days. My childhood life flashed before my eyes, and then yun questoin ko was answered.

My Dad looked upon my Mom and said. "" Mi, sabihin mo lahat sa kanya, I wanted him to know everything. Gusto ko sa lahat ng magkakapatid siya nalang yun makaalam. "" My mother held and squeezed my hand..and then she told me everything.

"" Mahal na mahal kayung lahat ng Papa mo. Gusto niya na matuto kayung maging matibay sa lahat ng bagay at hindi basta basta bibigay o susuko. Lahat ng mapait at masakit pinatikim niya sa inyo, dahil wala ng mas mananakit pa inyo kung hindi yun taong nagmamahal sa inyo at yun ang Papa niyo. Nagusap kami ng Papa mo, we had an agreement. He will be hated and I ( my mom ) will be loved. He will die na alam niya galit kayung magkakapatid sa kanya pero nabago yun dahil sa sulat mo. Nalaman niya na hindi ka galit sa kanya. Hindi niyo lang alam kung gano kayu kamahal ng Papa niyo. Tuwing gabi bago kayu matulog, matapos niya kayung paluin. Siya yun unang nag-aalala s inyo, uutusan niya ako na puntahan kayu sa kwarto niyo para i-check at gamutin mga sugat niyo. Tuwing may pinapalayas sa inyo, siya yun nag-uutos sakin na hanapin kayu. Ang Papa niyo ang nag-aalala sa lahat, siya ang hindi makatulog kapag wala pa kayu sa bahay. Siya ang nagpapahanda ng pagkain kapag alam na pauwi na kayu. Kaya wag niyong iisipin na sa lahat ng pamamalo niya hindi ko kayu tinulungan. Ang gusto ng Papa niyo ay matuto kayung lahat, he will die happy knowing na hindi siya kahit kailan nagkulang ng pangangaral sa inyo. How hard it is for him everytime hinahataw kayu. Ang totoo niyan siya ang umiiyak sa gabi. And he let me do the explanation sa inyo kung bakit kayu napalo. All he wanted is to have his children learn how to stand up on their own. Ayaw na ayaw niya na maging hangal kayu katulad nun mga kapatid niya. At alam niya, na minsan dadating sa buhay niyo, kapag wala na siya. Lahat kayung magkakapatid ma-rerealize that all along your father was right. ""

All fluids naglabasan sa mata and sa ilong ko. Nasagot lahat ng tanong ko. My father asked me to keep those words within ousrselves and he asked me to tell it to my sister especially my brother when the time is right. He also made me promise to read the letter sa funeral niya.

To end the very akward moment. My father cracked a joke... "" Akin na yang yellow pad, ako na magtatabi. Mababasa pa ng uhog mo eh. "" We all laughed and ended the night with forgiveness.

Next day I'm like a new person, parang nakawala sa hawla. Di ko ma-explain, it is like being born again.

Ayun lang po yun story ko. Salamat sa mga matiyagang nagbasa. Me and my dad are best friends today. Every weekend umuuwi ako sa Laguna, and palagi kami umiinom dalawa. Lahat ng values and principles he imparted sakin and he always wish for me to take care of my younger brother na I will lead him to the right path. Lumayas na kasi siya and never returned home. Minsan we talked nun brother ko, I talk sense into him pero it's very hard for him to accept. He endured every puinishment with hatred kaya ayun, he never wanted to go home. I'm still praying na before my Dad's time I will be able to ask my brother to see him the last time.

Pa, salamat sa palo mo.

**EDIT: TL;DR** 
Nagpapasalamat ako at ginulpi ako nun bata pa ako



**UPDATE:** I wish I could reply to all your questions and rebutt  to your opinions (logically) being thrown around but it'll really take time for me to do so and for that I apologize. I hope I can shed light at the very least and hope to answer some of the queries below. Believe me, I was really overwhelmed by your comments and I thank you all for it. 

I wrote this piece 7years ago in an online forum as well. There is a comment below that asked about it and yeah jpatricks1, I'm the same guy. I hadn't edited it since and it's funny to read it myself again relieving the moment I wrote it ages ago and I really sucked at writing at that time. Why did I even share it here in the first place you might ask? 

It was my father's birthday last monday and a flash of memories came upon me when I was a child and I thought of sharing this story to you guys. For the reason that most,if not all, forumers here in reddit are straight to the point and open minded people. I have no intention at all  to set this an example for any other parents or soon to be parents out there to think that abusing their child/children is okay so long as there is a stupid one to accept it and think that it is the only way to endure the pain and suffering the world has to offer. 

I'm an adult right now and a father to two as well. I have always burned in my mind that never my children will suffer the same way that I did. I scold them from time to time and explain them things that should and shouldn't be. I leave it for them to decide for themselves but I tell them exactly the consequences for their actions. I have spanked them one or two occassions but during those event I'm terrified at my own self, repeating the horrors of my past. My eldest is 8 and napalo ko siya I think not more than three times and I've used a pangkamot sa likod to pat his butt as controlled as I could, maybe a 0.00001 version of my Dad's. Afterwhich I have explained why I have to do that pamamalo. 

I've shared a part of my life. Take note, just a part. The totality of my person being has already been questioned here because of that tiny part in my life that I have shared. My father and my mother raised us as best as they could and what they see fit. I can't blame them. They have their own reasons and if their conscience can handle the fact that they hurt they own offspring, it is really not for me to tell. I can only tell you the part of which I understand them why would they have to resort to that kind of parenting.

It may seem all too surreal that I have accepted the fact that it is okay with me being brutally abused, but it is not. The story of my beating have been told in a narrative way to inspire fellow beaten child that one have endured, to send a message that beating is not the answer. That all suffering has an ending that might turned out good. There are a lot of quetions in your mind that may arise about what might OP thinks or what has he become. Let me tell you this, you do not look at the blank wall and just see the dot. Focusing yourself and get lost in the dot which is a just part of the wall. 




You look at the goddamn wall itself.
