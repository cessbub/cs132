"""Child Abuse""","Intro: Hi 🖐️ I'm a new user of this Reddit app. Recently nakilala ko tong app at community nato dahil sa isang podcast( kwentutan podcast) and naisipang kong mag share ng story ko.

Story:
May nakilala akong guy sa ML. Btw I'm bisexual pala.
So nakilala ko sya sa world chat ng ML, because he's looking for a bisexual bottom, when I saw his chat agad agad ko syang finollow then I message him; ""hi kuya I'm bisexual bottom po"" so dun na nagsimula. Araw - araw ko syang nakakalaro then dumating sa punto na gusto ko na syang makachat sa fb, then binigay nya naman yung fb nya. After non nagchat kami sa fb mostly every hour dahil sa pag a-update nya, and every night din naglalaro pa din kami. Hanggang sa umabot ng almost 3 weeks kaming nag uusap and don sa 3 weeks na yun parang I discovered feelings na for him. Sa panahong yon di niya pa din alam na may feelings na ako for him, ang pagkaka alam nya lang ay nakikipagfriends lang ako. 

Then one day nag confess sya and he's asking me to be his bf, I was so shocked that time hindi ko talaga expected na he also likes me. So ang nangyare di ako pumayag  na maging bf nya ako, sabi ko I'm not yet ready, pero ang hindi nya alam sinabi ko lang yun just to test him if he can wait for me. Just as I expected he said kaya naman daw niyang maghintay. 

Ilang araw din ang nakalipas tuloy tuloy pa din yung pag uusap namin. Nagshashare din kami sa isa't - isa ng experiences, problems in life, etc. There's this one experience of him na sinabi niya sakin na meron syang pamangkin na pumupunta sa bahay nila, mahilig daw yung pamangkin niya manuod ng TV sa kanila, di nya daw alam kung bakit sa kanila nanunuod knowing na may TV naman sa bahay ng pamangkin niya. Meron daw isang beses na don nanood yung pamangkin niya sa kanila tapos siya daw ay nakatulog but nakagising siya nang may nararamdamang  humahawak ng alaga nya, so di sya nagpahalata na gising siya, pinagmasdan nya yung bata nilalaro daw yung alaga nya 😆, pero gently daw yung pagkakahawak at malambot daw ang kamay ng bata😆so pinabayaan nya lang daw cause he also likes it, until magtutuloy na yun na parang ginawa na nilang routine. Nang sinabi nya sakin yun parang matatawa ako na iwan haha pero I felt jealous don sa bata😫.  

Then one day dumating yung araw na di ko malilimutan, around 3 pm sabi niya sakin maliligo daw sya para mabango daw ,bye muna and pupunta daw maya - maya pamangkin niya. Sabi ko ""sige bye btw wag mong hayaang gawin yung ano  haha masasanay yung bata"" but hindi siya nag agree kasi nga daw nakakasatisfied. Pabiro kong sinabi na wag niya gawin dahil nagseselos ako don sa bata. (Hindi ko din alam bat ba ginagawa at alam yun ng Bata knowing 7 years old palang naman) di niya na naseen yun chat ko, siguro naligo na yun sabi ko sa sarili ko. Then around 5:00 nag chat sya;

Chat niya;
(Mat sorry 😭)
(Di ko sinasadya)

Chat ko; 
(Angyare sayo?)

Chat niya; 
(siya kasi ehh binigla niya)

Chat ko;
(Huh? Anong binigla?)

Nag o-overthink na din ako sa mga panahong to.

Chat niya;
(Sorry talaga)
(Yung Bata😭)

Chat ko;
(Anong ginawa mo?!)

Chat niya;
(Di ko na kasi napigilan)

Chat ko;
(Ginawa nyo ba?!)

Chat niya;
(Oo😭)

Chat ko; 
(Masturbation ba?!!)""Haha direct tanong na agad ako ng ganyan cause I'm so curious na talaga

Chat niya;
(Hindi😭)

Chat ko;
(Ipinasok mo🥲?!!)

Chat niya;
(Mat sorry pero oo pinasok ko😭)
(Mat pano to? Nahihirapan siya maglakad😭)
(Makakasuhan ba ako😭?!!)

Haha diko alam kung bakit ganon naramdaman ko
pero parang sinaksak ako ng kutsilyo , to the point na parang sumasakit na yung puso dahil don sa sinabi nya.

Chat ko;
(Oo may kaso yan😭)
(Bat di mo pinigilan?😭)
(Di mo man lang ba ako naisip😭?!!)

Chat niya;
(Di ko na kasi napigilan. Nabigla ako ng sinubo nya😭)
(Kasalanan ko naman yun ehh dahil ako nagsabi dun sa bata na paisa lang kapalit ng chocolate😭)

Shocking talaga haha

Chat ko;
( bat ganyan ka?!! Ang selfish mo!!, iniisip mo lang yang sarili!. Di mo man lang pinigilan yang kabastosan mo!!! Bahala ka dyan! Ginusto mo yan diba?!)

Chat niya;
(Mat sorry talaga😭😭)
(Mapapatawad mo pa ba ako?!)
(Isang beses lang naman yun ehh)
(Promise di na ako uulit😭)

Chat ko; 
(Diko na alam)
(Ayokong magdesisyon ng pabasta - basta)
(Kailangan ko munang humingi ng payo sa friend ko)

Sa oras na yan humingi talaga ako ng payo sa friend ko, kiniwento ko lahat ng nangyare, pati sya rin nagulat haha. She advised me na kung may tunay na nararamdaman talaga siya para sakin di niya yun magagawa in the first place and naisip ko din why not alamin ko muna  yung side nya, kung bakit niya yun nagawa sa akin, 

Then after ng pag uusap namin ng friend ko 
Binuksan ko fb ko nakita ko siyang offline simula 7:00 p.m - 10:00 a.m haha di ako nakatulog non kaka overthink na bakit nya yun nagawa? Deserve ko bang maranasan yun?

Then nung nag online sya sabi nya
(Sorry kasi prank lang yun)
(Nagawa nya lang daw yun kasi gusto niyang malaman kung may feelings ba daw ako sa kanya)

Diko alam kung matutuwa ako o magagalit

Sabi ko sa sarili ko;
""Ganito ba talaga yung paraan niyang magpaconfess?!!"" 

Then yun nagpaliwanag siya na gawa gawa nya lang daw lahat. 

Matagal tagal din bago ko siya napatawad. Pero napagod na din ako sa mga prank nya. I left him kasi nasasaktan na ako sa mga prank nya, medyo namemersonal narin kasi minsan. Also napansin ko rin na para bang hindi siya seryoso sa akin kasi he always makes me jealous like( in his works may mga babae daw siyang ka workmate at ang sesexy daw tinitigasan pa nga daw sya ehh) it's normal naman na ma - attract siya sa mga babae cause we're both bisexual naman pero sana naman marunong siyang mag stick to one.

As of now di ko talaga alam if prank lang yun although nag send sya ng evidence na hindi nya nga ginawa but I'm not sure if the evidence is taken at that time, Malay natin matagal na yong picture na nasa mall sya haha

Hi sayo if mababasa mo to. Wag mo na sanang ulitin sa iba haha

Haha at don na nagtatapos ang story ko.
Haha literal na unforgettable prank
Hope you've enjoyed reading this story
Thank you and Good day!!.

The Auditory Pleasure of Being Used and Abused,"*Long read.* Sit tight and strap in.

You’d think I wouldn’t be back here after writing the first time, did you? I didn’t think so either… until I gave the Owner three prompts I can write about, but this piqued him the most. Will it do the same for you?

\----------

In the days since the first date, and the first time we were in a private place, things began to shift. I was very much happy being a plaything, because in being a *thing*, I don’t have to *think*. My career takes up most, if not all, my waking hours; that’s just Sales for you I guess. The industry I have to sell for is also unforgiving, and whatever time I have left I devote to myself… and then later, to going to places and meeting my Owner. It’s also nice having a person to run to and speak to with an outsider point of view; we’re at different life stages, so listening to him opine is like having a breath of fresh air between talking to clients and having my boss scold me from day to night.

This one time, my job required me to work on a weekend, with a 7:00 AM assembly time in a closed mall. My colleagues and I agreed to check in a hotel the night before, and I agreed to charge their room on the office account while I paid for my own stay *because*. On the work side of things, my Owner allows for me to be in control. He kept me company while I work alongside my teammates; he helped in doing the literal heavy lifting, too. Sure, I can probably carry my things, but with him around, I’m not allowed to carry even my own things. He’d probably carry me in public if I allowed him too.

The thing no one tells you about making decisions and handling people often is it gets physically and mentally exhausting as the day goes on. Once everyone has checked in, things are kept, my teammates are settled in their room, and I unpack my things, I set up my laptop in the middle of the bed as he lays next to me, hopping in and out of servers while I listen in to meetings. The sun says late afternoon, but my mind is spacing out pretty hard.

“Are you muted?” He says nonchalantly. I know what he means by that; he’s about to say something salacious and R18. I nod in silence and keep my eyes on my screen.

“What do you think about people listening to us having sex?” Now, forgive me and my mushy brain because as I was in the middle of a Google Meet, this came off to me as *we are setting up an audio Zoom call and a hundred people will hear you say my name.*

“H-ha?”

“What do you think about people listening to us have sex?” He repeats as if talking about the weather. “A friend of mine wants to listen to two people fucking as a birthday present. I didn’t say your name, but I said I’ll ask what you think about it. You can say no if you don’t want to.”

“O-oh. Well, huh, um. Okay.” I was–quite literally, too stunned to speak.

The tone in his voice changes. “Are you saying that because you want to do it, or are you pressured?”

I pause and the meeting I was listening in starts sounding like radio static. *Am I pressured? Do I want to please him? Am I uncomfortable right now? Why do I not find this discussion icky?*

“You can say no. I’m not going to find another fucktoy. But I don’t want you saying yes to something you’re not comfortable with.”

I haven’t spoken a single word, but recall all the times he’s sent photos and videos of us. I don’t find it disgusting that I find my naked body in everyone else’s screens, rather I feel rewarded over the *Sana All* or the questions on who he is with. That’s where the thrill lies: everyone knows.

And yet no one knows.

“Sure! I don’t mind. When? Do I log off now?”

He laughs. “No, later. We’ll adjust to your schedule.”

“Am I allowed to know this person?”

“No, you don’t get to know who she is.”

*She.* Well, given his voice, it’s pretty obvious why people would want to hear a recording of him fucking somebody. But me? Really now?

\----------

Another challenging part of what I do is trying to find time to relax and breathe. While people above my pay grade can relax after work; this time I’m left to check in on teammates and continue preparing for Saturday. He’s taken a break and a nap right before sunset, and I finally closed my laptop. I undress until I’m down to my shirt and underwear and lay next to him.

“I’m here na.” No response. Well, okay, I roll over–

…until two strong ass arms pull me back and I can feel his chest on me. That’s… interesting? (Romantic?) But it does feel good to have another human being not wanting to let you go. I dig that.

He stirs, and I face him. He seems a little bit awake.

“Can we have dinner at Mendokoro already?” It’s past six and I can feel my stomach aching for some food.

“One more hour.” *Ha, ano? Huy, gabi na.* “I’m still sleepy.”

He’s more relaxed when I am around and the concept of time is nonexistent. “Okay. Noted.” I lay still and hear his breathing deepen a bit, and rise back to the surface.

“Are you sure you don’t mind?”

“Oh, do you want me to be the one to ask for people to listen in? I mean, I can.” He smiles as if daring me to actually do it. I write at the freedom wall:

>anyone want to listen to two people fucking? React here.

I hear an oh when he’s seen the freedom wall post. “I think the birthday girl isn’t awake yet. Let’s wait for someone to react instead?” He tinkers with his phone, and my mind is wondering if he’s getting in a call…

“How about I–” *How about I get on top of you like this so you pay more attention to me, and less on that screen you have even when I’m not around? How about I look into the depths of your eyes and make you wonder how much time we have left together like this? How about you stop focusing on the birthday girl, and focus more on me?*

Just a thought, but I’m straddling him… and reach for my phone in revenge.

“Oh, look! Eight horny people want to listen to us fuck.” I put on my most delicious, can’t-resist voice. He tells me how he wants to pick out the Plan B if the Plan A listener isn’t available until–

“She’s awake. She’s here.” He puts on telegram, and hides the screen from me.

“Aww, is she one of your fucktoys, too?”

“I have one fucktoy; she’s right here.” He flips the switch based solely on the tone in his voice. *You do not talk about yourself like that. You’re my fucktoy, and I’m here with you. No one else.*

“She’s in the call.” His eyes relax, and puts the phone at the bedside.

And he puts a hand on my back and he’s on top of me. “You’re such a slut for wanting another person to listen in on us.” His smile is smug; I don’t like that.

“Oh, I thought you liked how much I craved for your cock? Hindi naman pala eh.” My inner brat is rising to the surface, milking the moment. “Hm, I was thinking about how much you’d love to use me. Oh well.”

“Aba.” He pulls my ankles to the edge of the bed; I’m too shocked to move. It’s scary how he can push, toss, and carry me with ease when I know I’m plus size. Now I know how it feels like, being a literal fuckdoll. “You might regret that.” He reaches for lube, and my performance anxiety kicks in, oh my god.

*Can she hear me? Am I being too quiet? Is he having fun? What if she’s fantasizing about fucking my Owner through me? Does she really just want to listen in?*

“You okay?” He whispers. I nod and let him lead.

“I’ll have you shaking by the end of this evening.” His mouth was on my body: my lips, my neck, shoulders, my chest. His hand is on my inner thighs, making its way up to my pussy. “I’ll make sure you…”

“Behave.” Oh god, *I’m wet*. I bite on my lips and try not to let a moan escape. He fingers me faster, and slows for a bit.

“Sir–I–*ah, fuck*–” I can’t stop cursing and then I hear a third voice in the room.

It’s *her*. Listening in, calling out his name.

*My Owner’s name.*

*No way in hell am I going to allow his name to escape from another person’s lips.* I resist and get him riled up, finger me until my thighs are wet, until I am left calling out his name, until my cries fill the room echo through its walls. I want to make sure she knows no one else gets to have him the way that I do. No one else gets to control him the way that I do. And no one else gets to take charge of me the way he does, ordering me to continue cumming even when I’m weak, dehydrated from screaming and sweating, and I’m surrendering solely over his *hands.*

“Mag-aattitude ka pa?” He pulls my leg and flips me on my stomach. “You know what happens when you’re being a brat.” He places his palm on my ass, gently massaging each cheek.

“I want you to count.” A beat later, *a spank*. I cower within myself. ""Count.""

The spank stings so much I can't talk.

""Palagay mo,"" he seems to say to no one, knowing someone else is invisible yet present in the room, ""How many spanks should she get?""

I feel my butt cheek get warmer. I pray it isn't a lot, because if he can be forceful with it, I will not be able to walk around the South tomorrow.

""Ten."" *Spank.* ""That's two."" I grasp for the sheets, wish I was standing in front of him so at least I have him to hold on to.

*Spank. Spank. Spank.* He switches between my butt cheeks in rapid succession. Lord, Jesus Christ. I moan in pain and he massages both cheeks.

""You okay there?""

""Yes, Sir. I can handle it."" I brace myself, hold on to the sheets so tight, my knuckles turn white.

*Spank.* I cry both in pleasure and pain. Spank. I'm sure I need help later. All my hunger pangs have gone and all I can focus on is his handprint on my behind.

*Spank.* ""That's enough."" He caresses both cheeks, and I feel warmth next to my ears. ""That's a good girl."" He plants a kiss on my head and gently flips me over this time. I cry when my butt gets in contact with the bed; it hurts so much.

""Are you going to be a good fucktoy now?"" The phone is next to me, but I trust not to look at who the person is.

""Yes, Sir."" I whisper.

""Louder."" He puts his hand on my neck, an ever-so gentle reminder of what happens to me during breath play. ""I said, are you going to be a good fucktoy now?""

""Yes, Sir. I'll behave."" I speak up. My body aches all over and I can't handle this right now. My pulse is still elevated. I need to calm down.

He chuckes into the phone. ""I hope you had fun listening to her. I'll have her calm down and who knows? Maybe we'll call you again in a bit."" *Click.*

He softens some. ""That's a good girl. Did I hurt you too much? How did it feel? How did you feel?""

""It hurts, but I can handle it. We're calling her again later?"" I brighten up.

""You seem tired na. Maybe another time."" He pulls me up for a hug and puts on my clothes for me so we can finally go out for dinner. It's 8:00 PM, my hunger pangs have left and returned because nothing else makes me hungrier than having my body convulse over and over from orgasming so much and so hard. It felt like one notoriously long round—something I realize I should get accustomed to if I'm here indefinitely.

In the morning after, we look back at the freedom wall.

>to the couple earlier: Let me know if you want to have fun again or maybe you guys are too tired because it sounded like you were fucking all day.

We're not saying she's wrong, but I'm also not not going to tell you that we fucked before we slept and I was fucked into consciousness over stalling from waking up at 5:00 AM.

\----------  
  
**Last few words:** Consent is sexy, and consent is key. If you feel discomfort, speak up. And it is the Dominant's responsibility to switch on and off and *be attuned if your submissive is in need of help.* It is the Dominant's responsibility to provide a safe space and take care of the submissive; this is a person's health and safety in your hands.  
  
And yes: I was repeatedly checked in on throughout the process for signs of anxiety and discomfort, which is why I am confident in providing consent.

why do people tolerate this kind of abuse?,"There are always so many posts involving incest especially with older family members… does nobody realize the older members are taking advantage of the much younger member? Abuse, especially sexual abuse, within families are far too overlooked.

Rape is not the only form of sexual abuse. Taking advantage of someone’s trust, especially younger and/or a family member, and leading them into an irreversible and mentally impactful sexual encounter is abusive and predatory. It doesn’t matter if the person is an adult already too—there is a clear imbalance in the power dynamic.

“Incest is considered abusive when the individuals involved are discrepant in age, power, and experience. The argument that a younger person may have desired, sought, or given consent is irrelevant. Those very behaviors may have been groomed, coerced, or generated in response to perceived pressure and/or threat from the more powerful person.” ([Psychiatric Times](https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/ramifications-incest))

The fetishization of family dynamics in porn, on the internet, and even media are so harmful to children, whether they’re still a child or they have grown. “But it’s just a kink, we wouldn’t really act on it!” That’s great if that’s true for you, but clearly there are people who don’t and won’t draw the line. And there are people who don’t see anything wrong with it.

Her mom thought I'm abusing her,"The other other day, Me and my partner got really spicy and usually as what I do, I shower her body with hickeys everywhere. From her collar bone, boobs, abdomen, thighs and everything everywhere all at once, except neck, cause she asked me not and it's against her school policy. Yesterday, her mom came over because she got some errands to handle here in the city, and while changing to her duty uniform, (my partner's a student nurse btw), her mom saw them marks. Idk if her father's game is weak cause her mom couldn't identify a hickey from bruises but she's accusing me of abusing her daughter because of it. Tita, if you mean abusing by letting her scream and scratch my back from time to time, then Yes, we're abusive to each other.",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/1acinqx/her_mom_thought_im_abusing_her/,t2_uk1z6h3f,2024-01-28 03:23:23,26,3
Saw my abuser today and had to pretend I didn’t remember.,"
I was molested from time to time from the age of 7 years old (I think) and almost raped by the same guy when I was around 9-10years old. He was my Mom’s cousin who was only 5-6 years older than me. The only reason he didn’t get to rape me is because I had a quick witted and assertive grandmother who was looking out for me. When she noticed that he took me to my room and we were there for some time, she knocked and pulled him aside. I don’t know what she said but he never came back. I even tried defending him afterwards, telling her that we were “just playing under the sheets.”

I am now a lawyer and saw him in my law office. I just came back from a hearing and he was there because he drove his Mom to have some papers done. I never told anyone and I never confronted him about it. The truth is that I forgot all about the abuse until I was 19 years old. I think my mind protected me from it. So I had to wave, greet him, and quickly go into my office and pretend to be busy.

So please don’t joke, makeup stories, or fantasize about rape and incest. Sexual abuse is so damaging. Kahit ako na hindi na-rape fully, I am still living with the after effects.",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/10p67l3/saw_my_abuser_today_and_had_to_pretend_i_didnt/,t2_5xg4fclu,2023-01-30 23:53:34,206,41
weird response to sexual abuse,"TW:SEXUAL ABUSE


I'm a victim of sexual abuse. It happened when I was at 1st grade to 2nd grade. Yes ilang beses naulit. It was a PIV intercourse. College na ko pero until now wala akong pinagsabihan. Ang weird lang kasi everytime nakikita ko yung  abuser, di naman ako ganon kagalit pero naiilang. This led me into thinking na baka ginusto ko yung nangyare? But wtf elementary ako non, and yung perpetrator was in highschool.

I did not tell my parents kasi naawa ako sa kung anong mangyayare sa kanya. Tho I told my boyfriend who it was and nagmakaawa na pigilan nya yung anger nya towards that person.

What's more weird is naaddict akos a feeling. I tried masturbating and watching porn at an early age. Pero nagsubside when I first had my consensual sex with my boyfriend.

Sometimes napapaisip ako if it even really happened. But curious lang ako if this is something na normal response sa sexual abuse? Or may nakaexperience ba? :(( thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/szblul/weird_response_to_sexual_abuse/,t2_73y2ptx4,2022-02-23 15:36:26,66,33
[TRIGGER WARNING] I'm being accused of sexual abuse.,"I'm a 23yo guy from Caloocan being accused of child abuse that supposedly happened 10yrs ago.

Before everything else, I would like to say that the family I will be talking about is powerful and capable. At least 600M PHP net worth is a rough estimate but they are lowkey. Not politicians, tycoons, nor business empire owners. This family is nowhere near perfect though. Rich fams have their own problems as well.

I am a nobody.

Sorry for the long read but I really need help.

I have a bestfriend of almost 2 decades, let's call him ""Nei"", 24yo . We have been by each other's side since Prep. He has a little sister, let's call her ""Pia"", 19yo, she's the BUNSO (this will be important eventually). College onwards, there were times that I would stay for at least 4 months straight in their home. That's how close I was to Nei and family. However, Pia and I were never really that close; just greetings, sometimes we play mobile games but always together with Nei. I'd see her walking around the house with comfy clothes (if you know what I mean) and it was nothing to me.

Pia is SPOILED AF. 2 nannies at the age of 19, the family has 7 drivers but she has a specific driver and that's the only one allowed to drive for her, being bought anything she asks for, etc.

Around May 2021, I saw Pia breaking down all by herself on one of their balconies. Being a kuya, I approached and she opened up to me about her feelings and problems within the family (infidelity), I then hugged her for comfort after giving some advice and that was that. After that incident, I noticed she became more comfortable and open with me. She started replying to my IG stories, ranting to me about her friends, her suitor, her ex, her gender crisis, etc. which I never knew before. She opened about nasty things, explicit things and experiences. She told me I was the only one she's ever said these things to as I know everything that's going on in the fam.

I never told Nei or the family any of the things she talked about. In my perspective, I was being a kuya keeping her in check and not breaking the trust and confidence she has in me by leaking her secrets to her fam. I was thinking that she is in a really bad state and I do not know what would happen if she's left with no one to talk to about these stuff. She has a history of hurting herself.

Of course I also told stories about me to not make her feel that the relationship was one way but I never talked to her about my sexcapades and the likes. Just life and adulting problems.

We started being really close and I noticed that we were being unintentionally touchy na. I started to notice little things. Like our legs would be touching on car rides (since she started to sit beside me which was never the case before), her hugging me on balloon fights, her hugging me because she was wet already and I was still dry on a family swimming trip. But I didn't mind. Everything was innocent for me. My intention all this time was to be a kuya.

There came a point where I dreamt of me and Pia making out and I jokingly told her about it in disgust. I only did so because I thought we were in that kind of relationship where we are able to tell each other everything.

This went on for months until November of 2021.

On November of last year, her family, I, and our circle of friends went to a 4 day trip to Balesin. My friends and I had a lot of fun, and again I was noticing the touchiness but I shrugged it off as I don't give any meaning to it. I wasn't touching her back or anything. Not intentionally, at least. We went home and dropped our friends off near or at their exact addresses. I had to go back to Nei's home as my car was parked there. Everything was fine. I even said goodbye to Pia as she was fixing her hair in front of the mirror outside her room.

The next day, I wake up to a spam of messages from Nei calling me things and wishing for my death. I had no idea why except for one message which left me confused. ""KAPATID KO PA TALAGA HA?!"". 

I WAS FUCKING CONFUSED.

I was blocked in all of his social media, I tried calling but I think my number was also blocked. I tried reaching other family members. I tried to reach him through his girlfriend. I tried everything but to no avail. The whole family shut me off. I had no idea what happened. All I was thinking was maybe he thought that I was hitting on Pia. Maybe he saw our messages. A friend gave me advice to let things cool for the meantime, and I did.

I had really no concrete idea as to what happened until recently when I talked to a mutual friend. Apparently, Pia opened to the fam that I sexually abused her 10yrs ago. I would like to add that they were not that wealthy 10yrs ago. They only had a 2-story 2BR house that time. She's claiming that I touched her, forced her to suck me in their own home. Now I know for a fact that this cannot be true. She has a nanny since birth and until now. I was never left alone with her. During that period, I was never in their house without Nei. Even so to this day, there never was a time that Pia and I were left alone in a room let alone their house.

I also know for a fact that a former nanny of Pia was fired at almost the exact timeline (10yrs ago) because the nanny MADE (not accidentally) Pia watch porn. Pia told her mom of the porn incident around the same time that it happened hence the firing 10yrs ago.

Up until now, I haven't spoken to any of the family members. I have tried over and over but they would not entertain. Nei's mom and I are still facebook friends. I've tried messaging but I've always been inboxed.

Now, story given, I have a few questions.

\- Is it possible that due to us being close or touchy since she opened up, it triggered a memory of something that actually happened to her but placed me as the antagonist due to the trauma?

\- Is it possible that she's projecting the porn she was made to watch onto us and us being closer triggered this?

\- Is it retaliation for me not entertaining her in a way more than a kuya after all that's been said and done?

I do not want to invalidate her and her feelings. I just want to understand.

I am scared. I am scared of what is to come if there is any, knowing how capable their family is. I'm scared of how the story will be twisted and only her being listened to having been the spoiled bunso.

A thought passes sometimes that I love Nei so much that maybe I should just grant his wish; my death.",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/ujfg75/trigger_warning_im_being_accused_of_sexual_abuse/,t2_mradsdjg,2022-05-06 12:29:28,62,37
Is it normal to still think of an abuse that happened years ago?,"TW:// sexual abuse

So this happened when we were young, my ex bf started touching me in the most random places without even asking for my consent (sa park, sa bus, sa simbahan). He also pressured me to send him nudes and threatened me that he’d just get it from other women, or that he’ll just pay to sleep with a hooker if I didn’t do it. Of course my innocent mind just obeyed since I was scared, and I couldn’t open it up to my friends because they were more innocent than I was. Also, weeks after we became “official” he opened up about wanting a threesome, and he was fantasizing on having a threesome with my bestfriend 🙂. 


Fast forward to April 2016, he coerced me into having sex with him. He threatened me that if I didn’t do it with him, he’d kill himself. He even sent me an encrypted suicide letter that I should open when he dies. I felt helpless, and just unwillingly gave in just so he wouldn’t do it. 

It didn’t stop there, everytime that we would “date” (he’s in college at a different province while I was a senior high student in our city) there would always be sexual activities involved, like I never experienced having a wholesome date with him. He also told me that I should just study at his university and not at my dream school so we could have sex regularly, like that was his only motive. That’s when I lost it and became more firm with my decisions.

I had a high functioning anxiety as well and I really refused having sex with him because of the pregnancy scares, and then he proceeded to tell me that if I’m too scared of it, then we’d rather just anal sex.  

At the near end of our relationship I already avoided seeing him (the trauma of being touched again took a toll on me) and then he cheated on me just because I didn’t satisfy his sexual needs 🙂

It’s already been four years and I blame him for what I’ve become. I have trust issues over men ( I don’t even have straight male friends, only homo men) I am scared to commit, I don’t like physical touch, and probably the worst thing is how I became hypersexual, probably as my trauma response. As for him, he’s living his life as a chemical engineer with a long term gf. Sucks for me because I might need therapy to get over with all this shit. 

All I want is to have a positive outlook on relationships again, to believe in love again, that there’s more than just sexualizing yourself to fill the void :((",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/vwl986/is_it_normal_to_still_think_of_an_abuse_that/,t2_ldbpo4nf,2022-07-11 23:34:42,13,22
I wanna get fucked in a five-star hotel,"Just a random thought while working. 🥹

In terms of wealth, I’m just a part of middle class family. Mabibilang lang sa daliri ‘yong times na nakatuntong ako sa five-star hotels and that’s either for work or freebie ng bosses ng family/relatives. 

Kaya siguro bigla kong fi-nantisize na pumunta lang sa five-star hotel solely for the purpose of getting fucked. Gusto ko ma-dominate ng kung sino mang guy magdadala sakin do’n.

Like I should be thankful to get there for free but in exchange, I need to be used and abused in bed. Hahahahaha.

Is it sexual abuse if my body likes it but I don't?,"Pasensya na kayo sa title. Naguguluhan kasi ako and wala ako makwentuhan kasi iskandaloso tong isheshare ko sa inyo.

I'm 24, kakagraduate ko lang last year and been living with my older sister for 8 months na. She's 27 and siya ang tumulong sakin to land a job pagkagraduate ko.

Things are great between sa amin ng sister ko and open siya sa family namin about sa sexuality nya. She's always been bi and wala kaming naging issue ng family namin tungkol doon.

This started around october last year. We had some friends over sa apartment. May inuman, kain and the works. Umuwi mga friends namin and ako naman since di ako palainom, ako lagi ang naglilinis ng bahay pagkatpis ng mga social gatherings since ate is laging wasak beyond recognition.

Naglinis ako, naligo, nagcellphone(chat chat sa mga kalandian) then I decided to go to bed na. Checked on my sister on what she's up to.

Naliligo pa sya.

""Teng, tulog na ko. Oks ka lang?""

All I heard was her grunt. Ganun lagi sya. Lasing kung lasing then sometimes susuka.

Pinuntahan ko siya sa bathroom para masure ko lang. She gave me a thumbsup when I ask her id she can handle her self.

Nahiga na ako knowing na okay lang siya. 

I think 1am na ata non when I noticed may nakayakap sakin. I didn't mind since dalawa lang kami ng ate kong nandun sa bahay. Closed my eyes and decided to try and go to sleep na ulit. 

Five minutes later naramdaman kong hinihimas niya yung tummy ko. Di ko binigyan ng malisya kase yun lang naman. And if anything, it felt comforting. Then, naging sensual siya for some reason na di ko maexplain. Yung distance nya sakin mas lumapit at yung paghimas nya ng tiyan ko felt different. Di ko maexplain e. Basta parang may haling malisya na? 

Things got a little outta hand nung nagstart na sya mahprogress sa underboob ko. Gumapang na kamay niya paunti unti pero she didn't cop a feel. Hangang dun lang sa underboob ko talaga. 

I dont know how long this went on kasi naguguluhan ako that time. After niya matapos magexplore ng underboob ko she took her hand off of my shirt and hugged me all night.


Di ako nakatulog. Tangina 5am na ata gising pa ko kasi di ko alam ano nga ba talaga nangyari. Nauna syang bumangin sakin and acted like wala syang ginawa or whatever. Ako namang si gaga di ako umimik. Baka kako wala lang iyon or a fluke. Sister ko siya and di ko siya paghihinalaan ng ganon.

Until things went further down south nung naglockdown na. Ilang beses niya ginagawa yung hinihipuan ako sa legs pag akala niyang tulog ako and all. Tatabi siya sa akin sa bed ko kahit na hiwalay naman talaga kami ng kwarto. 

Naging mas intense na talaga nung april 10th. Kasagsagan ng lockdown non and wala kaming pasok. Puro wfh. Dito ko na tinanggap na talagang minamanyak ako ng sarili ko kapatid.

All this time laging tummy, butt, legs and underboob ko lang ang hinihipuan niya before. That night she went on to fondle my breasts. As in hinimasan niya na talaga ako. She played with them for atleast 30 minutes. I was awake the whole time and alam kong alam niya na gising ako kasi sino ba naman hindi magigising sa gigil ng kamay nya sakin. 

""Ate, ano ba??"" 

Di siya kumikibo. Nung nagsalita na ko, she placed her right leg on top of mine. She started whispering on my ear.

""Gusto mo naman, di ba?""

I kept on telling her, ""ate, ano ba?!"" ""Tama na!""

Nung nilalakasan ko na boses ko she started to pinch my nipple. 

""Kung ayaw mo, bakit ganyan reaction ng utong mo?""
I shit you not. Verbatim tong sinabe niya sakin. Di ko alam san siya kumukuha ng lakas ng loob that time para maging ganon. She licked my neck and tried to kiss my lips even! 

""Ate, tama ba to. Ano ba?!"" 

She  lifted my shirt and sucked on my nipples. Tangina ako namang si gaga confused kasi talagang di ko na sya matigilan. 

Pumatong sya sakin. She's still busy playing with my breasts tapos yung isang kamay ko hinawakan niya and pinasok sa underwear niya. She told me to rub her clit.

""Kapain mo tinggil ko""

Di ko ginawa. I laid there like an idiot habang nagpapakasasa siya sakin. Nung hindi na ko nagsasalita, nagstart na syang ibaba yung panty ko that time. Nakahiga lang ako then sya naman tumabi ulit sakin. She went back to sucking and fondling my breasts tapos sinusubukan niyang ipasok yung right hand nya between my legs. 


This is where it gets more fucked up...

Nung pinipilit niyang kapain ako down there, bumigay ako...

I was letting out soft moans na and di ko naman talaga matanggi na masarap siya. I eventually let her have her way with me. I just laid there. It even went as far as she made me finger her vaj habang hawak nya kamay ko...

It was so wrong. Putangina. Wala ako mapagkwentuhan or whatever. 

Does this still qualify as abuse? Naguguluhan and sobrang konsensya ko. It happened twice na that we went all the way. Same shit pero lately talagang nagiging physical ako sa kanya and sinusuntok or sampal ko siya para lumayo na siya sakin.

I was so wrong and weak. Nalulungkot ako and ni hindi ko maikwento sa jowa ko dahil ate ko nga ang involved.",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/hl1g7a/is_it_sexual_abuse_if_my_body_likes_it_but_i_dont/,t2_75mdj9i0,2020-07-04 18:50:54,32,24

New Kink Unlocked,"Recent sex encounter : 09/28

I HAVE NEVER MOANED LOUD IN MY ENTIRE SEX LIFE! I have always been reserved and vanilla most of my sex life. ( what I meant by loud is that loud enough that your neighbors will get freaking worried because it sounds like you’re being abused, but no just completely being pleasured. I do moan, but only loud enough that it would just be and my partner would hear )

Recently been reading smut (Twisted Love by Ana Huang) and it was so freaking hot.

New kink I am talking about though, is being choked and hair pulled back, and not just a tight grip, I mean real hard. Can-not- breathe tight.

I feel fucked up, and I constantly find my hand on my neck or my hair tie too tight. I’m constantly horny, and just getting wet, and constantly wanting more.

I think I’m broken 🤣🤣

Edit : BTW good horny-morning 🤣🤣

Edit 2: sa mag nag ssend ng private messages. Sarreh, mine doesn’t work. Check my profile though 🤣🤭

Got cheated (an incest story),"Trigger warning: SA

Long story ahead but I hope you keep up with this. Huhu!

Met my ex way back Senior High, we were a pandemic couple. We used to be so fun and happy throughout our relationship—there may be aways and such but we can talk all about it before we sleep, until maging okay ang situation. Basically, we were good as a couple.

__________________

For context: My ex was sexually abused by his uncle around 8-9 years ago. After her parents knew what happened, she never met that man again, until 2020 Pandemic Era. Her family visited their province where her uncle lives. And since then, whenever there is an occasion, they will go there. And ever since then, marami siyang interaction with that uncle.

Before we became official as couple, she already told me that trauma of her and the moment I heard it, I got mad and saddened with her story. That's why nung kami na, whenever she visits their province, lagi siyang nagke-kwento sa'kin ng mga interaction (manyak way) niya with her uncle which I get frustrated and worried about her. And since I am hundreds of kilometers away, all I can do is to be there for her, assure her, and show my presence for her.

__________________

Going back. We're already more than two years already, she confessed something to me—that she's having an attraction feeling towards her uncle. My initial response to myself is ""How?"" ""Why?"" which makes me do research and read articles regarding traumatic response. There, I found out that mostly of abused victims are having an attractive feeling or sense of validation from their abusers. After knowing this, I immediately replied to her that I understand her and regardless of her attraction, remember what he did to you and yada yada of assurances.

Every time she visits to their province, we always argue a lot kasi she's failing to update me and assure me with all that I am asking for such as her location, sino kasama niya, and keep on reminding her not to be alone. In these times, I already have my instincts—I don't know how and why pero may instinct/suspicions na'ko.

March this year, I found out that my ex and her uncle is already doing the deed ever since January this year. With consent. Not just she gave consent, she also initiated it some other time.

How did I found out? I discovered a twitter account containing all the tweets related to her interactions with that uncle. She made a thread of all the interactions + the deed they did, and these was tweet ON POINT. As in the details were clear, from how it started, where he touched her, how she liked it, and how she craves for it.

I would forgive her if she regretted it after or it only happened once, but it happened THRICE WITHIN A WEEK in January. Furthermore, after her visit from that province, she wasn't able to go back na since busy sa school YET there are tweets there that she's craving him, his dick, his lips, his taste, and such. To inform y'all, there are tweets there na tinweet niya yet magkasama kami ng mga araw na 'yon. Ouch. Haha!

To add as well, after they did the deed, we were talking in messenger and I have no freaking idea na nangyari na pala. Haha. I broke up with her a week after discovering it, yes I waited for a week because it's her examination week and I don't want to cause her low scores in exams. 

Her counter argument was that she was r*p*d but I believe otherwise because she craves him even when we're together, even months has passed since they met? She continues to gaslit me to the point that I reached out for a professional help in mental health to know if I am wrong, if it is my fault, if everything is my cause. I spent thousands just to have my answer. After therapy session, it was clear to me that none of it was my fault—but I am sure that it was she who needs more of the professional help.

Months has passed. I thought I moved on but it's still killing me, the pain and the question that's keeping me all night ""Am I not enough?"".  I still hate her for everything.

After the breakup, do y'all want to know how is she? Well, she spread a different narrative to our common friends and her friends and that I am the bad guy for leaving her because she was r*p*d. People were hating me and I found out because some friends reached out to me and they know I won't do such thing, and I told them the true narrative.

At the same time, my last news from her is that she was in her hoe pase since one month after our break up. She met a lot of guys in bed. Continuously meeting and interacting with her uncle.

Does this hurt me? HELL YES. But I know to myself, it's not my responsibility anymore or ever. She has to heal on her own, and I have to move on kahit ang hirap hirap :((

That's all for tonight. These are keeping me at late night so that's I why I have to vent these out. Thank you, if you reach here! May you continue to move forward.",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/1775pj2/got_cheated_an_incest_story/,t2_sio1hfmg,2023-10-14 02:46:27,481,107

Forced Sex/CNC Kink,"As a girl, sometimes I wonder kung normal pa ba na I fantasize about being forced into sex. So I did some research on why I, and some other girls, like it.

""Some women have these fantasies to feel that their desirability has the power to make men lose decency and self-control. Evolutionary studies have shown that when they are most fertile, women prefer powerful, more aggressive men;""

As someone on the bigger side of things (plus-size), I totally agree with this explanation. Usually feeling so insecure about my body, it is just satisfying to know that someone still gets turned on.

I know a lot of molested and raped people are traumatized, (and I still do not condone rape or any form of abuse), but for some, it is a way to feel wanted and desired.

To the women of AJ, do you agree as well on this explanation? Or do you have other reasons why CNC turns you on? I'd like to know.

To the men of AJ, this is not an invitation to start molesting and abusing women. Not everyone shares the same thoughts and outlook on sexual activities.",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/1425bwt/forced_sexcnc_kink/,t2_vipxgvww,2023-06-06 13:45:48,84,13
PLEASE stop subjecting your girlfriends/partners to the Yuzpe Method,"It's actually crazy how people still recommend it as contraception. Birth control is **preventative**. There is a reason why Plan B (the emergency contraception Yuzpe replicates) is called Plan B. It is literally meant to be a last resort if your first method of protection fails, like if the condom breaks, pills were missed, the IUD was dislodged, or the implant was broken/expired. I repeat, it is a **last resort.**

**Why can't we use it as birth control?**

* ***It's an extremely high dose of hormones.*** For those who may not be aware, the Yuzpe Method is a process that requires the usage of multiple combined birth control pills. Four pills followed by another four 12 hours later. The reason why it requires a break is because four is already a shit ton of hormones to take all at once, and if they took the required total of eight pills, they'd probably throw it up right after.
   * To give you perspective, a high dosage pill like Trust contains 30 mcg of ethinylestradiol and 125 mcg of levonorgestrel. That is the dosage taken daily to protect them for a whole month. A morning after pill like Plan B contains 1500 mcg of levonorgestrel in a single dose. **The Yuzpe Method totals to 240 mcg of ethinylestradiol and 1000 mcg of levonorgestrel within the span of 12 hours.**
* ***It doesn't work when she's ovulated.*** Its main purpose is to delay ovulation. That is why her cycle is often messed up and delayed after this process. If she's already released an egg, there's literally nothing else the pills can do.
* ***The side effects from high hormone dosage is awful.*** Some women get lucky and don't feel as sick, but for a lot of women this is not the case. Terrible nausea (that often makes them throw up so they end up having to repeat the entire process), migraines, body aches, irregular bleeding, insane mood swings, painful cramps... and those are just the side effects the pills cause. What about the anxiety and fear from getting pregnant? Not knowing if your withdrawal bleeding/ECP spotting is actually a period, which is the bleeding that guarantees no pregnancy?
* ***Excessive use can cause long-term health risks.*** The levonorgestrel pills compatible with the Yuzpe Method process like Trust and Lady have estrogen in them. If you happen to rely on this method as ""birth control"", you're putting yourself or your girl at risk of blood clots, stroke, thyroid dysfunction, fibroids, ovarian cysts, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, and endometrial cancer.

Guys, **unless you are willing to endure these side effects and this awful experience as a whole if you were in their position,** **USE ACTUAL CONTRACEPTION.** Stop whining about condoms not feeling as good because most of the time, there's tons of time to prepare and get actual contraceptives like the pill, implant, copper IUD, and injectables before trying to have unprotected sex. If you don't want to get someone pregnant, wrap it up. If you don't want kids at all, consider a vasectomy. They also offer reversible vasectomies.

And girls, do not let your partners convince you into having unprotected sex. It doesn't matter if they try to say it's your ""safe day"", unprotected sex is unprotected sex. **It's the woman who has to deal with hormone overload, and if last minute panic emergency methods don't work, it's the woman who has to deal with the pregnancy.** Put your foot down and protect your body from unnecessary risks and hormones.

incest: like why tf would u talk proudly about incest? 

leaked scandals: isn’t it insensitive to be proud watchers of matters that probably made people depressed because something private about them was leaked? 

fantasizing about successful sexual harassment: it literally just fed and gave confidence to sexual harassers to attempt to sexually harass others with the thought that it’s gonna be a successful encounter.",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/x1i3ej/people_are_getting_weirder_and_weirder/,t2_dgnseti4,2022-08-30 20:41:53,317,66
making sub men cry,"making submissive men cry in pleasure —

is something i have been fantasizing for a while now.

i’m pretty new at this, f23, straight, vers

i have only experienced being dom-ed and guys usually take the lead but due to the unrelenting weather, i have been indoors and on the web too much.

for the past month i have been touching myself with the thoughts of topping men, degrading them, making them cry both in verbal abuse and pleasure. i want to make them beg and reward them, stimulate and leave them shaking, begging, grasping the sheets begging for release.

i wanna ride them to dawn but not allowing them to touch, cum, nor take control. i wanna be fucked but only after their throats have dried up and tear stains mark their faces from all the pleading and begging they had to do.

Gangbang bukkake,"My ultimate fantasy is to have a gangbang.. Maybe 5 men.. One inside my pussy, one in my ass, one in my mouth and one in each hand.. And the guys I'm jerking off playing with my tits, squeezing and pinching my nipples, maybe lick it or suck it. To be simultaneously pleased in all of my holes must feel so good.. To be used and abused as they please to the point of exhaustion. Be a cum dumpster for a night, my holes filled with cum, dripping.. My tongue out, just waiting for the guys around me to jizz on my face.. Cum all over my body.. I'm insatiable.. Hmmm, but it's all but a fantasy.

bf wants to choke me til i pass out,"Disclaimer: This isn't a DV abuse story!

I was the one who taught my boyfriend how to choke me properly and how he realized I like getting choked. It's an exhilarating experience and it turns me on more, my senses are heightened plus he gets to pin me down with one hand.

I usually lead my boyfriend's hand to my neck whenever we have sex and he makes gigil sometimes. He chokes me so hard and he looks at me with all seriousness and horniness and I'm just smiling and laughing and moaning.

He keeps asking me if he can choke me til I pass out and I keep saying no. It's fucked up but the only reason I don't want to is because I don't want him to get arrested for my murder 😂

Anyway, he just chokes me hard enough that I tap out na. It's a pretty dangerous game and we don't do it everytime. Sometimes he just chokes me lightly for like 5 secs then removes his hand off my neck to grab me somewhere else.

Erotic Asphyxiation isn't for everyone but it's definitely my cup of tea. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/1b58xvi/bf_wants_to_choke_me_til_i_pass_out/,t2_87fjkk28d,2024-03-03 13:02:37,17,23
Ginising ng libog,"*This is a SKL moment and not an invitation for anyone. I'm not interested in anything so message someone else, okie?*


Just this morning nagising ako around 5:50 am feeling mega horny. I reached for my phone so I could watch porn clips on reddit. But I opened my phone and saw a message on tg from an online friend. He sent me a link to porn, it's a couple doing tamed lazy fuck. It was still hot but it felt so boring watching it. 

When it was done, I found myself searching reddit for gangbang clips. I've never tried gangbang. Not even a threesome yet. But I've been masturbating for hours watching gangbang clips. At some point I've started searching for old men like grandpa old type gangbanging young girls. 

Tangina ang hot mag imagine na ako yun being used and abused by multiple men. Parang ang saraaaaaap. I know I've fantasised about it lots of times before but I'm surprised by how instinctual I craved specifically gangbang porn kanina.

Also tangina netong uterus ko for being herself. Why can't you just stop ovulating every damn month so I don't crave dicks every couple of weeks?? Tangina talaga. Ayan tuloy need ko nanaman mag masturbate para maging good mood nako ulit. 😅",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/rurmaj/ginising_ng_libog/,t2_gj9b57h1,2022-01-03 11:21:46,59,32
I'm professor's dirty little secret... and I like it,"Have you ever met someone that you'd actually allow to use and abuse you? Like you're completely aware that they just want you to satisfy their carnal cravings but you still allow them to have that access sayo because it turns you on? Tipong aabot sa point na ikaw pa nagmamakaawa na gamitin ka nila nang paulit-ulit kasi nasasarapan ka rin. I know I've posted quite a lot about the professor but I still can't get him out of my mind. It's been two weeks since the last time we played with each other but I could still vividly recall how turned on I was with him every time. Like paano magrespond body ko sa moans niya, and how I would beg for him to use and abuse me like a little slut. I badly miss the anticipation of being woken up in the middle of the night because he wants to use me.

I loved the way he dirty-talked to me. And I've been craving for him to treat me like his own personal fuck toy and cum dump again. Grabe 'yung halos gabi-gabi akong nagmamakaawa sa kanya na kantutin niya ako nang paulit-ulit and buntisin niya ako. I needed him to breed me and knock me up. Ibang level 'yung libog ko sa kanya to the point na grabe panggigigil ko sa pussy ko every time. May times na 'di ko na alam gagawin kasi I badly wanted to feel him deep inside me. I wanted to know gaano siya nalilibugan sa ginagawa namin. Nakakamiss na natatapos kami with my mind literally going blank sa sobrang libog and sarap. I miss the way he would remind me of how much of a whore I am and how much he enjoys doing all the fucked up things we both like. I really miss being his plaything that he could just leave alone after he's done using me.

My manic and depressive episodes in the last few weeks turned me into a self-destructive hoe and had my libido going through the roof. Yes, I've been enjoying playing with other guys but they can't drive me crazy like his fucking dick. Maybe because we have our little secrets together - the things that make our sex incomparable kasi we're both fucked up people who enjoy fucked up things. I honestly wanted to get him out of my system but I really love being his little slut - his dirty little secret. He's my entire fucked up fantasy and I couldn't give that up either.

Fucking a pilot,"Lets call her annie. Mestiza 5 5"" slim some tats and pale skin. She is a pilot based sa cebu. Met her a few years back because she was a guest at a wedding we both attended in tagytay. Same table kame and got both called sa wedding games. I had to use a pick up and everyone laughed. Sa after party we got talking and exchanging info. And to end the night she went with me to my room. 

We cleaned up and made out sa bed. I rubbed her while she jacked me off and we moaned alot. When i had precum i took a condom and wore it. She rode me and grinded slow while i pinched her nipple and let her suck my middle finger. I slapped her a bit and pulled her hips so she grinds deeper. She came on my cock and i went on top. Placed her ankles sa shoulder ko and fucked her. Kissing her ankles while i choke her a bit and pounded her. Few more pumps and she came again. It was easy to make her cum since she hasent been fucked in a while na daw. So she was hungry for cock. I flipped her into doggy and pushed her face sa mattress. She was moaning hard and i felt her pussy gripping my cock and she came again. I pulled out and flipped her and came sa tits nya. Fuck it was good sex pure lust. We cleaned up and slept. Pag gising ko wala na sya sa room and i got a dm sa ig ko saying she will hit me up when she comes back to mnl.

i love being the slut of my bf's friend group,"this is like a continuation to my first post, read it first if you'd like but basically, one of them became my official bf,

but even so, he allowed his two friends to keep using me except for sex, he likes it when other men touch me but we don't trust strangers enough to do that so we just got his friends instead 😂

pag magkakasama kami, his friends would take turns on groping me, lamas sa boobs, spank sa butt,

but since my bf is a bit sadistic, he would also make me do some humiliating things like,

putting a vibrator inside me habang kinukwento ko sa friends niya kung pano kami magfuck, he would also make me kneel in front of them and minsan i would suck their fingers while at it, and give them handjobs basta payag si bf, they would also get unlimited nudes (faceless ofc)

this may seem bizarre but we trust his friends and i love my bf enough to do all of this and i really like it too 🤤 

and whenever we would fuck, he would always tell me how much of a slut i am for being like that and that makes our sex 1000x nicer 😌",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/1579xdl/i_love_being_the_slut_of_my_bfs_friend_group/,t2_o9e1eucz,2023-07-23 17:09:49,179,20

A  language between us,"Years ago, I was non-existent to him eventhough we grew up in a small community. Years ago, I would have never thought he'd be where he is right now.

Deep inside me.

Yet I am not his nor will he ever be mine.

I'm a fucking cheater but I crave him the most. I love giving him head and witnessing the ecstasy; in his moans and tightening hair grabs, while he throbs inside my mouth as I devour every inch of him.

Damn it. I'm already consuming every drop of him way before we even get undressed.

And when we fuck, I couldn't care less if he finishes quickly or he takes his time as long as for that moment, he is mine. And he alone gives the most weakening orgasms I will ever know.

If only fate allowed it, I'd be his to use as the sun debuts and his to abuse before sleep's signaling cues.

Yet he is not mine nor will I ever be his.

But alas, you're about to awake from your nap and our time now is about to fade. So I'm making you cum one last time as our body speaks its rhyme.

i let my 3 guy friends finger me and it was memorable,"long story ahead!! 

so i have these three guy friends that i'm really close to, friends na kami since childhood and everything that we can talk about, napagusapan na namin, life, school, work etc. name it,

so i'm VERY close to them,

but one day, nag church kami altogether kahit hindi naman kami religious and the sermon was about honesty, how truthful you are to yourself and the people around you,

tapos after nun, bigla nalang nila akong kinausap and told me na they're lusting over me for years now and they always talk to each other about how ""sexy"" i am etc. 

at first, i felt very disrespected and violated? hindi ko kasi expected yun,

they told me na ""natamaan"" daw sila sa sermon kaya they admitted to me,

then one of them said na kung talagang naoffend ako, they can stay away from me if that's what i want,

but after some time, the anger that i felt just suddenly disappeared and i started to get turned on??

sobrang weird ng naramdaman ko kasi i'm supposed to be mad and yet i got turned on???

but after about 2 weeks? nagkita ulit kami alongside with other friends and i got a bit drunk and that's when it all started,

the confidence just came up to me and told the three of them out of nowhere,

""binastos nyo ko diba? bat di nyo pa lubus lubusin?'

and they just stared at me for good 30secs hanggang sa sinabi nung isa ""seryoso ka ba? di nga?' and i said yeah?? i'm serious

and siguro inabot kami ng mga 30 mins kasi ayaw talaga nilang maniwala sa sinabi ko but they gave in anyways,

we went to one of the rooms (it was a house hangout) and ako na ang naghubad sa sarili ko 😭

i was like ""go na mga bhe"" HAHAHHA ganun kasi tawagan namin lol

one of them hesitantly touch my 😺 and i started to loosen up and sunod sunod na sila,

they simultaneously fingered me, 2 fingers muna hanggang umabot sa 5, and IT HURT SO BAD BRO, it felt like i was getting fisted kahit hindi pa naman lampas sa knuckles,

i was moaning so loud sa halong sakit at sarap, i was gripping the two of them on my each side, 

they slapped it, ate it and just overall abused it until i came,

yung isa gentle lang, he kept asking me if i was okay and dahan dahan sya,

the second one, VIOLENT sya ghorl 😭 ang bilis nya mag guitar and ang hapdi 😔

and yung pangatlo naman, sakto lang, not fast or slow, moderate lang ganorn,

hindi ko na inisip kung ano bang itsura ko nun because the moment was just overwhelming, until one of them said na mukha daw akong hentai??? HAHAHAHA

after i came, we all just laughed HAHAHHA they cleaned me up too at for some reason, hindi kami naging awkward? like we came back outside like nothing happened,

idk if its the friendship that we have kaya ganun nalang kami naging komportable?

but we still remained friends after that, hindi na sobrang as in super close kagaya ng dati pero naguusap parin naman kami kahit papaano, 

this happened many months ago and may mga nililigawan na sila ngayon so i had to distance myself out of respect but that memory is special to me, idk why pero basta, i treasure that event,

I think I've been raped,"I was working in BPO 2 years ago and I decided to resign because I cannot stomach seeing my abuser.

I was 21 years old. New to the corporate world. Made some new friends and I also started drinking. He was my TL, I idolized him because he taught me everything that I didn't learn in training. I was good in doing my job. He was not good looking at all but he's good with his words. He's married but he has 2 mistresses in the production floor. Our team always go out for drinks after work and when he's drunk, he always share his secrets about his mistresses. 

He was about to be transferred to a different account so our team decided to go out for drinks for one last time. We went to this local inuman, we ate and drink some beer and gin. I was already drunk but this close friend of mine had a crush on one of our teammates and they wanna go to this famous bar. They invited me and she said she's gonna take care of me and hanggang 1AM lang daw kami, so I went. While nasa bar kami I was only sitting holding my bag while I watch my workmates kissing and dancing. My TL approached and said if I want some drink, I said I'm good but still he insisted to give me bacardi with cola. Iinom ko and my head was already spinning. I asked the bartender nasaan ang CR cause I need to pee. I still remember na nadulas ako and my TL helped me. Next thing I remember, I saw one of my workmates whispering something to my TL. I cannot hear them cause the music was too loud. My friend said na uuwi na kami, I heard my TL insisted na sya na mag uuwi sa akin cause honestly I cannot go home on my own. I remember we walked out from the elevator and we were already in the taxi. I remember hearing na walang bakante sa lodging house na pinuntahan namin so the taxi driver offered a different one. Next thing I remember I was on the bed, hugging my bag. When I turned around I saw my TL wearing a condom and then I black out.

I woke up thru my alarm and I was only wearing bra and undies. My head was still spinning. I went to the bathroom to take a pee and I tried my best to put on my clothes. I  called my roommate and asked her to pick me up. Before ako umalis I saw my TL's wedding ring sa table so I took it. 

Next day sa work I asked my workmate to give my TL's wedding ring. I remember he was smiling when he saw me and I hate remembering that ugly face. I started avoiding him but he kept on asking me to go on lunch. I decided to resign cause he disgust me and now I feel disgusted with myself. Until now, I hate na di ko maremember if we had sex but I'm pretty sure if we did it was non-consensual. I was raped!

every rose has its (t)horns,"
currently, nasa study hub doing some work. there’s this med student beside me studying.

in my peripheral vision, i can see that he’s looking intently sa tattoo ko sa paa. I feel so sexy right there and then.

slowly turned my head on my left as I caught him staring for too long.

he looked away naman agad. Couldn’t help myself but stop from what I was doing and looked on his side. 

still ignoring my presence, I checked on him. his face, his arms, down to his bulging thingy sa pants niya.

nagsasalitan lang kami ng tingin from time to time

he’s moreno, has a clean cut, about 5’6”-5’8” ata, not so lean but he’s obviously working out 

for about two good minutes, in my head he’s kissing me hungrily while roaming his hands around my back, my breasts, my neck, down to my 😻 i can feel the heat in the insides of my slacks already. pulsating and ready to be abused by that bulging hard of his

typing this out, i don’t think if I can last long in my head. pakunwaring hindi affected sa presence niya, I simply caress my thighs under the table until near my 😻 trying to be discreet since I’m out in the public and there are a lot of students around.

There is a difference between sadboi and legit guy who's suffering.,"Share ko lang rant ko dito, pwede?

I am kind to all who I am chatting with and I am horny too but don't use your pa-pity sad times in a daily basis as a reason in a daily basis to fuck me. Buy a fleshlight or pay a sex worker to do it for you. 

PLEASE GET CHECKED! ALSO, YOU DON'T OWN ME AND MY TIME TO REPLY TO YOUR CHATS ON TIME.

I use my socials when I'm in the mood. I reply on chats when I'm in the mood. Pay me and my time then I will reply to your chats then.

I already blocked those who did this to me on Telegram. This is also one of the reasons why I rarely use my Telegram na. Men should make a good career to have a better living and not ask money to their parents. My gosh 2022 na asa pa rin kayo sa pera ng magulang nyo, mahiya naman kayo. 

Mental health is not a joke. I know some guys who are currently suffering mentally but they don't use it to get in between my legs. They try to be better kahit hindi sila magpadoctor, they try to fix themselves on their own.

Get checked by a doctor and not by a pussy. Grow up dudes, masayang mabuhay. Depressed din ako for more than half of my life but I still try to live my life the best that I can without dragging anyone down with your bullshits.

Mabait ako pero kapag tarantado kana nagsasabi na talaga ako ng mga masasamang words. 

Yun lang.

Mag kaiba yung lalaking sadboi lang at lalaking may pinagdadaanan talaga.

Open relationship,"°•°Not for everyone and long story ahead°•°

For the background me(27m) and my partner(24f) just started having an open relationship. We also have a baby. She works in a BPO and I manage a small business.

How it started and why decided to have this kind of relationship is something I will put in this story. We first know each other in one of the party and she was still in a relationshit. We have something in common since I once work in a BPO also and we have so much in common including the company, experience, and pinagbabawal na teknik. I'm an easygoing person kaya siguro she appreciates my company. Fast forward they broke up and kamuntikan narin akong makabugbog ng tao for what he has done to her(blackmail,sexual abuse, physical abuse, etc.). As a person who hates to see violence in any form against sa mga kakilala ko, I promised to her that it won't happen again to her(which I do the same promise to multiple people that is very much close to me mapa lalake o babae). I helped her heal up and siguro with the time we spent together we got so close and nagkapalagayan na nga ng loob.

We entered the relationship and what we felt is real no doubt. I cared for her as much as she cares me(if you have relationship with someone that has relationship trauma sobrang lala magmahal as long as honest ka and loves them back). We were happy but then her trauma kicks in. She is scared na baka maiwan ulit and I will do the same things if I'm unhappy. It's hell from time to time since biglang iiyak and minsan mabibigla ka tinataboy ka minsan may sapak pa. We managed to get through it and kahit medyo bata pa kami eh we decided to have a baby.

Bago pa naging sila ng last ex nya, she was in relationship with someone with high libido pero treats her like a princess. Kinokwento nga nya sa akin that they will do it in a parking lot sa school, mall, work, and even road side the highway. Dumalang nga lang nung nag break sila but she is still active with fubu. Nawala lahat ng Yun when she entered her last relationship before me. Aaminin ko di ako gwapo at juts narin pero yung ex nya kahit bugbugin ako mas gwapo parin ako at yung tite nya e abanse pa daw ako ng kalahati and uulitin ko juts po ako. Lumaki yung ulo siguro ng mokong kasi habulin si partner and sobrang daming nagpaparamdam na gusto sya kahit alam na may partner and may anak na lalo na nuong single pa sya.

She was abused and nawala lahat ng init sa katawan nya and was probably reignited when I came in her este in her life and yung dating sya yung gustong tumikim pag may nakitang masarap is nagbalik. In our relationship we have this rule na ""It's better to be honest than get caught by the others"" for transparency since we both know we are still young and mistakes is inevitable, only time will tell. She tells me na may lumalandi sa kanya and I'm happy for her since bumabalik ang confidence nya. She knows tambay ako dito sa Reddit and telegram even before we know each other and my porn collections, hentai, and group chats are not even a secret for her since sometimes we watch it together. We have this weird support system as long as we are not low-balling each other it's good.

Nung naging kami I told her na she will be the one(since my main purpose for having a girlfriend is to have a wife). I may look at the others to appreciate their beauty but won't touch a single skin which is pinanghahawakan nya and syempre ginagawa ko rin. And maybe because of that it deepen our relationship which resulted with our first baby. This past few  months everytime na uuwi eh ichichismis nya sa akin(ganun ako ka supportive kahit chismis G parin) na may lumalandi daw sa kanya na newbie and medyo mas bata, mas matangkad, gwaping and juicy daw. After non is medyo naging busy na since it's holiday and so am I. Medyo nakakaramdam ako na sabay ng papalapit na pasko eh medyo nagiging cold sya which I brushed up since I know busy sya.

New year sumakto day off and pahinga namin. Kinagabihan we fuck. The end.

So I did an informal investigative research on Omegle,"Happy Sunday, AJ peeps! I got a good one for you! So I went back to Omegle not for a hook-up, but to do an investigative research. My study was about “How do people give advice to a typical relationship problem based on the gender roles of the relationship?”

Scenario is this: “my partner is not being romantic enough with me even though I’ve communicated with her/him already multiple times about it”

I used “Kausap” for my omegle tag as I thought this might yield me more people who were just seriously looking to talk about something. In the end, I talked to 10 people about this, 6 women and 4 men between ages 23 to 28. As a control point, all should have had a prior serious, long term relationship. None were informed they were being used for a study prior but were told after.

Half of the unknowing participants (3 women and 2 men) got the situation of a male ranting about his unromantic gf and the other half (3 women and 2 men), a female ranting about her unromantic bf.

Regardless of the gender or age, for the half with the “female having an unromantic bf”, conversations were short and simple and can basically be boiled down to this, almost verbatim.

- Your boyfriend is toxic and not valuing you as a person, you deserve so much better from another guy who will actually value you and treat you right. Know your worth!

For the half with the “male having an unromantic gf”, conversations were deeper and everyone gave their reasons as to why the gf was being unromantic. The answers I got were:

- Maybe your gf is just going through something

- Maybe your gf has a hard time expressing her feelings

- Have you tried meeting halfway? Maybe your expectations for her romantic side are too much

- She might be trying her best to be romantic but you don’t see it or your expectation is not what she is capable of

- Just keep showing her how you want to be treated, I’m sure your gf loves you but she needs to be guided

- Your feelings are valid, but maybe your gf has some suppressed trauma

I wouldn’t say I’m surprised by the result except for the fact that nobody really showed concern or thought of a reason for the unromantic bf’s actions and just assumed the worst of him. Maybe it’s really just history playing a factor of how more women are being abused as opposed to men in a heterosexual relationship.

I’ll leave it up to you AJ peeps to discuss amongst yourselves this very informal research I did from 1am to 4am earlier today. I know, I know I have too much time. My friends bailed on our supposed Saturday plans, okay? So I got bored lol. I hope you all have a great Sunday!",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/15jc85u/so_i_did_an_informal_investigative_research_on/,t2_6kzupbq2,2023-08-06 09:04:03,197,17
Nakakalitong FUBU Part 2 Update,"Hi ajpeeps! This is gonna ba long long so please be patient with me :) would appreciate your advice.  
Just recently, someone asked about my previous post regarding my old fubu, I figured na i-kwento ko and ask for advice.

First Post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/169q5lw/nakakalitong\_fubu/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=ios\_app&utm\_name=ioscss&utm\_content=1&utm\_term=1](https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/169q5lw/nakakalitong_fubu/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1)

  
So after the first random fuck nung day na yon, like I said, we kept talking and nagbibigayan ng updates. He would be a little tampo na tila nagpapasuyo kapag hindi ko nirereplyan pero nothing serious. We would be on calls na inaabot ng 1 am. That kept going for 6 days. Nung 7th day na magkakilala kami and magkikita kami, di na kami masyado nag usap and nag call kasi magkikita nga naman later that day. Prior to meet up, we made plans na mag fuck, manood kami ng movie together sa SM, kumain sa labas together, fuck sa parking lot, fuck sa bahay then uwi kinabukasan.  
Around 1 PM kami nagkita, pagsakay ko sa car, sinabihan niya ako agad ng pokpok jokingly, nag kakabiruan na rin kami ng ganon kasi nagbibiruan na rin naman kami talaga. Konting kwentuhan while he was driving. We got there sa place and started fucking, I was moaning and he started choking me and sabi ko “baby that’s good”, “ugh sarap”, “akin lang yan ha”, and umiling siya sa huli kong sinabe, sabi niya hindi raw. Medyo napahiya ako ngl haha. We had 2 rounds nung hapon na yon, kasi makakarami pa naman mamaya. We showered, and while showering, sinabihan nya ako na sabunin siya like he was a boss, and so I did. **He was sounding a lil bossy all of the sudden, sinampal niya ako ng konti, hindi siya masakit at all parang sampal na biro and told me na butas lang daw ako sa kanya.** Somehow I let that slide. From him being malambing to being bossy. After mag shower, we were cuddling and gusto pa ako na lumapit sa kanya, konting kwentuhan and then he told me ihahatid na raw niya ako kasi andon daw tito niya bigla, medyo nalungkot na ako non bigla. Di ko pa alam if seryoso siya so I asked him and sabi niya oo raw at andon daw tito niya and then showed me proof na andon uncle niya. I didn’t buy it, pero hinayaan ko na lang. If he’s lying eh di hayaan na lang, if he’s not at least di ako nagpumilit.  
We left and then nasa car na kami non and asked him again if ihahatid na ba talaga niya ako, and said na ihahatid na raw niya nga ako. I thought he was joking that time and was thinking na gusto niya lang kumain and mag hang out sa place ko but at the same he was also sincere so ayun tahimik ako buong 30 mins sa byahe and wasn’t talking to him, I was so distant. He was talking but I was so quiet and distant and tungo lang and ngiti. **He even asked me na manood daw kami sine sa SM sa city namin and I said no**. Sobrang nalungkot ako nung night na yon because I got may nails and hair done, I cleaned and made myself look attractive only for me to be used like a sex toy. I really thought we had plans.  
I asked him to at least I drop ako sa city proper pero sabi niya baka traffic daw, di ako nagpumilit so sabi ko sige sa SM na lang sa city namin. And he did, **I was left alone that night walking sa highway, feeling super sad, drained, disappointed ang mangiyakngiyak**. Feeling ko pokpok talaga ako non and baliwala yung effort ko na mag ayos for him. We part ways, I went to my fave coffee shop, he called and I answered but I wasn’t so jolly like I always was sa calls. He asked me if galit daw ba ako and I said no, asked him why would I be mad and he said because I was not talking the whole time sa car. Basta the call ended di ko na tanda how.  
He messaged me na di na raw niya ako kukulitin and message na lang daw namin isa’t isa kung trip makipag fuck. I got home and didn't respond sa messages niya dahil super lungkot ko. The other day, nakita ko siya online and no messages from him unlike he used to do. I called and confronted him, explained my side. He said he didn’t lie daw, he was also expecting na matutuloy yung plans namin kaso his uncle came over, also his friends went to watch the movie sa SM sa kanila so hindi rin pala pwede, he even showed proof. I asked him kung yung plans na ginawa namin ay front lang niya para ma fuck ako or totoo and he said totoo naman daw. Pero somehow di na siya ganong enthusiastic sa talking to me like last week nung magkausap kami sa call nung time na yan.  
I knew then it was time to cut him off, di na rin ako nag rereply masyado, no calls the whole week na rin, he would text me and then di ako mag reply agad or long press ko lang siya and most of the time di ko agad siya nirereplyan sinasabi niya **suplado raw ako or “sige, long press pa”**. **He was also ignoring me and so fair lang pero I didn’t confront him kapag ginaganon niya ako unlike him na gusto nirereplyan pa rin**. Tho may updates siya pero not like before. He would go to the gym and I would ask for pics and sasabihin niya sakin ano raw ba ako gold though joke siya pero I know ayaw niya magsend talaga. **He wasn’t like that before so ayun alam ko nagbago na talaga siya**. Tbh, ayaw ko na ganon kami kasi I liked him kahit di pa kami gaano magkakilala. Super gusto ko siya kahit ginaganon niya ako we tried na magkita ulit pero somehow di natuloy ulit.  
The sudden change in treatment kept going and going until I confronted him. I said bakit ba siya ganon, ayaw ng di agad nirereplyan pero di naman nagrereply din agad, called him out for being rude to me, for playing with my feelings and for treating my like shit. I told him na I never entertained anyone for almost 9 months and he was the first person I gave a chance to after a long while so ayun nakaka putangina lang na after some time na pananahimik ko, ginago ako ng pinagbigyan ko. I told him we should stop talking and he should find someone to fuck with.  
He confessed, sabi niya **he never treated anyone like how he treated me before** and that he would only talk to his previous fubu kung mag memeet, nothing like he did to me kasi we used to call and update each other. He said he started being distant sakin because **he was trying to protect himself**. He acted the way he acted nung last fuck namin because **he never had a serious relationship with anyone and our setup is becoming to emotionally involved, he wasn’t sure whether to continue because he couldn’t even comprehend his feelings and he only had casual setup before so what we had was something new for him pero he did enjoy the flirting we had**. I cried, I ask him if tatapusin na ba talaga namin and he said it’s up to me because I was the one who initially ended things so the choice was in my hands back then. I was weak, sabi ko let’s give it a chance.  
We tried, pero somehow I still felt like wala talagang energy like the first week we started talking. We actually had plans unang una pa lang, na itong araw na ito ay gagala kami with his friends. Akala ko yayakagin niya ako kasi nagka ayos na kami pero wala, di niya ako niyaya. I eventually just stopped messaging him and wala rin akong narecieve na any messages from him. Things just ended.   
After 2 weeks na walang usap usap, I got drunk and had to courage to ask him out because I really liked him. I asked if he wanted to meet because nasa area niya lang ako and he said he couldn’t dahil may activity daw sila need tapusin ng kaklasi niya. I sent a video asking bat di niya na ako kinakausap, note that medyo sad ako sa video na yon and lasing din. He didn’t reply, dude left me opened.  
Kinabukasan, I deleted everything of him. His contacts, pics, screenshots of landian, removed our conversation both parties. I wanted to move on. Naawa ako sa sarili ko. After months, I met new guys, may veterinarian, pyschologist, and iba iba, had sex with some of them and they made me cum and sex was better than this dude na kinabaliwan ko. **I thought I moved on after almost 2 months because I was finally able to entertain new guys, di ko na rin siya naiisip and madami na rin naman nga kasi akong naging manliligaw ulit** (note that di po ako pa fuck lagi huhu). Until recently, **I rejected guys kasi I realized hinahanap ko siya. I started thinking of him again, stalking him again sa socmed, may urge ako na i message siya ulit.**  
For the final part,   
Do you think I should message him ulit? Talagang hinahanap ko siya, iniisip rin. I want to follow him on instagram and talk again. If mag message ulit ako, how do I approach him? What do I say first? If wag naman na, why not? Please gisingin niyo ko if nahihibang lang ako :/  
**Super crazy na after not thinking of him for almost 2 months, thought I moved on, bigla na lang siya naiisip agad?? And now sobrang kating kati ako I message siya ulit. It’s not just sex na habol ko sa kanya, I really like(d) him.**  
Ayun lang, any advice would be needed. If majority says na i message ko ulit siya. I’ll make a part 3 as an update. Thanks for reading!",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/17m3zlo/nakakalitong_fubu_part_2_update/,t2_6g0szzdz,2023-11-02 21:54:03,4,15
I'm guilty of relying my financial on alter,"I run away at home when i was 17 cause of my abusive parents, now renting a place dahil nakapagipon ako.

Watch Me... Please,"*I usually write unsent love letters, but this guy? Whom I met here a year ago? His demeanor impregnated my thoughts, leaving me with nothing but lust letters. He didn't even get to fuck me... not even close to tasting me; he just took away my breath while caving in to his glory. Mods, if mali po flair ko, kindly inform me na lang po what to use when posting ""confessions/lust letters/experiences"". Thank you po.*

&#x200B;

To the guy I eagerly sucked sa parking lot, I wish I can taste you again. My throat aches to be abused by your tip, my mouth waters as I think of your girth and scent. Sure, my mouth was dry that time because of smoke, but my hole was dripping. Your moans motivated me to push you deeper. You're the third huge guy I sucked, but I'm sure you're the one who wrecked me: my inconsistent libido craves you, your eyes and the way your eyebrows raise, how you kiss me in between my attempted sloppy head. You're one of a hella Hedonistic fixation I'd never want to get rid of. You're my favorite decadent indecency \[decadent delicacy\].

My body could still recall how your icy fingers played with my hole meticulously that night; massaging my every inch, every corner of my lips and hood. That time, I'm pretty sure your pre-cum's my religion, my talisman against sanity. God, I want to taste Your wonderful creation again. I'll be a sinner and make him my punishment.I badly want you to know how much my holes crave for you. By just thinking how you'll make me gape back there weakens my knees. I want you to watch me slurp another woman's peach, glossing my lips while locking eyes with you... Showing you how badly I want you to devour me, how much I want you to pound me mercilessly while I kiss her down there. Watch me... Please.Play with me again. You're a dangerous flow of water: igniting my desires while succumbing to your tidal waves of lust. Drown me with those drowsy eyes and cum.

One of the most disturbing conversations I've [M] had with someone on Omegle,"I was using Omegle in the past day as part of a social experiment when I encountered this person whose story is really a cause for concern. Let's call her ""Gamma,"" 22 years old, from some place in Rizal. She relayed to me her concerns regarding dun sa kanyang boyfriend of six months who was 30 years old. Let us call this (spoiler alert: trashy) boyfriend of hers as ""Porcus.""

She told me that she wanted advice from strangers as to what to do because she felt sad. When I prodded her as to what made her felt sad, she said na minumura raw siya ng boyfriend niya dahil dinilete ni Gamma sa phone ni Porcus yung nudes niya pinadala niya sa latter. 

It turns out that what I discovered about Gamma and Porcus' story was just the tip of the iceberg. Naglabas pa si Gamma ng sama ng loob. Kaya pala galit si Porcus e dahil daw ""precious memory"" yung nudes na yun and si Gamma raw yung ""pinakamasarap na nakasex ko sa mga nakasex"" ng gago. Dahil emphatetic akong tao, the quoted statements she mentioned really sent chills in my spine. So I told her, if advice is what you need, the number 1 advice I can give you is really break up with him and report him sa kinauukulan.

Easier said than done. Apparently, binablackmail siya ng kanyang boyfriend who threatened to spread her nudes kapag hiniwalayan siya. I told her na she is in imminent danger.

Although I tried my best to be of help, at that time, but it was only encouraging her to report to the police o lumapit sa mga VAW-related NGOs that I can do out of respect dun sa wishes niya na di mag-exchange ng contact details. Understandably, hassle sa kanya magreport, but I also explained na mag-eescalate yung abuses if she doesn't cut him off and report him sa pulisya.

Hayun, the conversation abruptly ended dahil sa internet connectivity problems. I do hope she gets the concrete support she needs.

To Gamma's boyfriend and to anyone else who exploits the trust of their KR's (karelasyon) in this manner: Justice knows every person's number. You will get what you deserve.

I badly wanna try anal but...,"I've been single for a while now and ghaddd I miss sex. I was watching porn the other day cuz I was tryna release some stress, and I came across this vid where the girl lost her anal virginity to a huge cock. I came so hard and fast while watching that vid. 

It made me miss having a dom where he can rape and do things to me. I miss being manipulated in bed. I miss being fucked hard that tears are streaming down my face.  I miss being degraded, choked and slapped.

How I Became A Cuckold,"This is a story that involves infidelity so fair warning to everyone.

I met my wife in college. We had a wonderful sex life when we were still students. Car sex, motel sex, outdoor sex, etc. She also told me that she had a dark past. She has been sexually abused by her first cousins when she was young. She also had sex with them when she was a teen. It was consensual but of course taboo. She also was sexually active with her exes. I accepted her for what she was. But during college, if you know of the psychiatric term ""repression"" I somehow had it before. I had my own experiences of sexual abuse when I was a kid but repressed them during my adolescent years.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to being married to her a year later due to an unexpected pregnancy. She got pregnant by me after we passed the licensure exams for nurses. The kid is mine, no doubt about it. He is a spitting image of me now when I was still a teen. We already have 2 kids now. They are already in their teens.

&#x200B;

3 years into our marriage, my wife was chatting with one of her OFW exes. Ex/3rd cousin I think. They were planning to meet once her ex visits the Philippines. I caught her and was hurt about it. I reprimanded her and she apologized. She even cried. I forgave her.

&#x200B;

6 years into our marriage was the time I got suspicious. Whenever someone calls, she would leave our room and talk to the person outside instead. She reasoned that it was work related so I brushed it off. There was a time when we both were drinking booze over the weekend (which we usually do) she started to confess.

&#x200B;

Before I proceed with the story, I have been very sexual with my wife ever since we got married. We have sex everyday until this day. We both have a high libido. I even proposed to her around 2010 that we should try threesomes or foursomes. She would sometimes entertain the idea but would veto it after having a post nut clarity on her end or whatever the female counterpart for it is.

&#x200B;

Going back to my story, my wife confessed that she was seeing someone and had sex with someone at work. She remembered by proposal before about having threesomes or foursomes and wants to experience it as well. She also wanted to have an open relationship to which I excitedly agreed to (probably because of my high libido and the booze).

&#x200B;

We started doing threesomes and foursomes and also hooked up with other people. But as days go by, the hurt of my wife's infidelity had already sunk in. I became distraught and anxious. We fought about it for several months. All the hurt that I felt inside opened up a can of worms inside my head and told her about my childhood experiences which I stored away somewhere in my mind for several years. We both divulged to each other how the abuse started and how it stopped. I was both abused by my aunt (10 years older than me) and my uncle (15 years older than me). I told my wife that I was bicurious to which she also confessed the same thing to me.

&#x200B;

She also confessed that she loved doing things inconspicuously. Her kink was to hook up with someone without my knowledge since the taboo of having sex with her cousins affected her current kink that's why she cheated in the first place. I know cheating is wrong but I accepted what she did due to her sexual past. I however, started to have a kink of watching her having sex with someone. We both accepted each others kinks.

&#x200B;

I allow her to chat and meet other men without me knowing. She would tell the story of her encounter once it's over. Sometimes she would record the encounter if the male allows it. I am always aroused with her encounter. I sometimes jerk off to her hook up videos. Sometimes, she allows me to watch her hook up with someone live or via video call. I would just be there in the background masturbating. But we still do threesomes or foursomes sometimes. I also am hooking up with other women and men, she also sometimes hook up with women, but the joy of watching my spouse fuck someone else is incomparable.

&#x200B;

You may call me a cuck or a simp or whatever names you may want to call me. I may get downvotes for this post. But since we both are mentally and sexually damaged, we accepted each others flaws and embraced them. We embraced whatever daftness or orientation or sexuality that we have. We still both love each other. We still have vanilla sex every day or every other day. But we often engage into our deviances from time to time whenever we are available just to get rid of the mental itch.

&#x200B;

How about you guys? Anyone who is cuck like me? Any same experiences with your spouses? You can also ask me anything (AMA) if you want.",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/oc3936/how_i_became_a_cuckold/,t2_2d4ybs04,2021-07-02 13:02:58,132,28
ang sarap magjabol on 🍃,"ang sahol ng word na jabol noh? magjajabol? HAHA anyways i am not promoting substance use or abuse, here's my experience

i got edibs just because, felt gloomy and since wala rin namang pasok, decided to have some me time haha

i ate around mga 7 pm ng dalawang approx 20 mg cakepops, i intended to get like super down and relaxed that night. i waited 30 mins for it to hit me. bagsak ako and half-sleepy when i decided to touch myself. i used my small vibrator to help kasi my eyes wont even stay open long enough for written porn. still i pull through and started feeling the tingles. i kept shutting down then gigising na naman ulit. i felt like i was peeing 😂 and was checking again and again to see if my perineal area is basa. hindi naman. when i felt my orgasm approaching, that's the freaking good part. i felt 9 different intensities na parang hindi matatapos. i was literally convulsing na para akong sinapian. just thinking about it makes me laugh. and 🍃 kinda desensitized me that even after orgasming, i still feel tingles unlike when i cum sober. it felt like i can continue and reach another orgasm. but my body got the best of me and sabi nya, tama na. so i slept like a baby for 15 hours. haha

Found a man who can be real disrespectful to me in bed,"“I don’t care if you’re pleased or not. I am only using you for my own pleasure today.” I would melt whenever he’d say that. I KNOW IT’S WEIRD HAHA But he knows kasi na I like the idea of free use and CNC. I really like it when he’s being forceful. And if I say ‘no’ to his request he’d slap me and say “Who said you can say no to me?” and proceed to do his thing on me. ISTG it’s such a turn on! Sometimes he’d just pin me on the bed and slap my face continuously before saying “Fuck you’re so pretty” then he’ll start sucking my nips. Minsan swollen na cheeks ko from his slaps but I really don’t mind haha I asked him if I’m pretty why does he like hurting me (with consent ofc) and he answered na he likes the way I look when I’m struggling or in pain.

He’s the only man who has satisfied my kinks and be real abusive, dominant, and disrespectful to me in bed. Slapping, spanking, spitting, choking (and not the gentle type gosh I couldn’t breathe haha sometimes choking by means of his hand then sometimes his dick bc he’s BIG) etc. And goshh, whenever he’d make me swallow his cum he’ll tell me to open my mouth with my tongue out to check if I really did swallow it. He’d then say “Such a good toy” AND I WOULD FEEL KILIG GOSH HAHA Yes, he refer to me as his personal toy/sex slave/slut and it’s okay and I would still feel kilig HAHA Next time I’ll ask him to tie me up as he refused to blindfold me coz he apparently likes my eyes and my face is my selling factor daw lol haha

Add: Just sharing my appreciation to this man. +Everything’s consensual and terms have been laid out beforehand. There’s aftercare, a real gentleman, and he takes me out on dates in exchange for the free use clause haha We’re not together but exclusive. (Thank you, Bumble!

Deal Breakers,"TL;DR mga taong hindi pasok sa preferences, nagrereklamo dahil hindi sila pasok sa preferences

Natatawa ako sa mga tao from a certain subreddit na people are familliar na just add dirty before its name and you'll already know what I'm talking about.

Nagrereklamo sila sa mga preferences ng ibang tao from another certain subreddit pero without the ""dirty"" na bakit daw kailangan na conversationalist at may political preferences? Never pa daw sila nakakita na gusto ng DDS or BBM puro nalang daw kakampuke ang preferred.

May factor daw ba mga yun habang in action? Aba'y malamang, parang starterpack na yan bilang tao sa kung paano siya mag-isip and sa kung paano siya kikilos and makikitungo sa ibang tao in relations sa kung anong klaseng pag-iisip ang meron siya. The fact na hindi nila gets kung bakit factor yun and even using the term ""kakampuke"" already speaks about them as a person eh hahahaha.

Let's just say na karamihan ng mga supporter ng isang side is mga utak rapist or kaya naman mga victim blamer sa usaping sexual abuse, harassment, and the like. I wonder paano kaya sila during the deed kung ganyan pala sila magisip? I wonder lang naman???

Though hindi naman ibig sabihin na ""kakampuke"" or leftist na isang tao is better na agad siya, syempre meron din na mga kupal kahit sang ayon pa kayo sa candidate niyo is hindi naman ibig sabihin tugma na kayo sa actual social issue discussions may mga utak rapist pa din dyan. Pero kung DDS o BBM talaga 80% of the time kupal e.

Tsaka isa pa, yung mga post na nirereklamo nila is hindi naman natatapos sa sex lang. Yan ang problema e nabasa nila naman post and hindi naman sila ang hanap bakit nagrereklamo? Edi doon sila sa tutugma tungkol sa kanila imbis na nagrereklamo sa posts na hindi naman para sa kanila, dyan palang lumalabas na kabobohan e 🚩🚩🚩 di malabo one day makakita nalang tayo sa details na non-negotiable yung may isip.

Raped by a Transgender F.,"I saw a post here in AJ yesterday about the issue of Transwoman, in fact, I am the one who pm'ed him to warn others about this transF na nasa phr4r parin. Pero it seems na bawal ang name drop here so I will abide with rules. 

So let me just share to you guys what happened and to our dear admins and moderators dont worry I wont disclose his name even if nakikita ko pa rin syang nag ppost sa phr4r, disguising pa rin as F and doing the same thing.

For the sake of discussion, lets call this transwoman as ""X"". 

I am a straight male residing in makati. Like most of the guys in phr4r, I am using the subreddit to find someone for mutual NSFW stuff. When I saw X's post, immediately pm'ed him (with the thought na F sya since F4M) since malapit sya sa place ko and d ba convinient nun. 

So at start, nag reply sya sabi nya willing ba daw muna ba ako mag send ng nude photo na may face dito sa reddit chat, nung una pinipilit ko sya na TG na lang pero nag send sya ng photo nya (infairness muka talaga syang babae) so ako napased na din.

Fast forward nung kinagabihan we agreed to meet and gawin sa place ko. Sinundo ko sya since malapit lang nman sa condo ko.

While we are kissing na tnouch ko yung private part nya and napafuck talaga ako sabi "" tang ina gay ka pala"" sabi nya no im trans. Sabi ko why F ang nalagay hindi T blah blah so sabi ko lets stop this.

The next thing he did is so unbelievable. He threaten me naikakalat ang mga photos ko sa phgonewild once na hindi tinuloy ang sex. Tang *** mga pre kahit sobrang gusto ko syang patayin on the spot so sobrang gigil hindi ko nagawa kasi sa takot ko na ikalat nya. Isip sip ko may mga trans pla talaga na ganun. Mapang linlang and abusive. 

I can consider that as a rape pero ano mag report ako sa pulis? Tang ina nakakahiya as straight guy na naging biktima ng transF.

Fuck talaga. Hanggang ngayon sobrang trauma pa rin ako. And hindi ko pa rin kayang ishare kahit kanino in person. Sobrang naawa ako sarili pero tang ina mas nakakahiya if mag susumbong ako sa pulis.


PS. Salamat sa mga supporta actually. Sobrang naapektohan na pati trabaho ko sa nangyare. Gabi gabi kong iniisip nasa pinatay ko na lang sya nunh gabi na yon. Sobrang sama nya. Pwede naman kasi sabohin na T4F taena talaga. Ingat kayo.

PSS. nakita ko nnaman post nya sa phr4r sobrang nakakagigil may mga nabiktima na rin pla tong hayup na trans na toh salamat sa lahat na nag DM. Fvck talaga. Mag ingat kayo lalo na bawal natin syang pangalanan. Mag ingat kayo context clue na lang mga pre.",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/uf8an3/raped_by_a_transgender_f/,t2_mjzbdgv2,2022-04-30 18:21:02,330,135
Fuck before marriage,"Just wanna share lang my own perspective. When I started exploring this culture, ang dami kong na-realize. First thing first, women are prone to abuse talaga. Especially as someone like me na hindi alam if naka-cum ba sila unlike sa men na may lumalabas. Samin kasi, sa loob lang nafefeel, parang wala siyang external thing to assure us. Chariz. Before ako pumasok sa hookup culture, nagmamasturbate na talaga ako and will ask questions from my guy friend (ka-dirty chat ko before) na experienced na. He's informative naman, talagang he knows the deal. So na-share ko sakaniya na di ko alam if naka-cum ako kasi wala namang lumabas, ano lang pulsating lang tapos grabeng throb.


 Sabi niya may mga ganon talaga, edi naisip ko what, how about yung mga girls na hindi alam if naka-cum ba sila? What, hahayaan nalang nilang gamitin sila kasi satisfied na sila don? How about yung mga nakaka-feel lang ng pleasure pero hindi naman stable to the point na makaka-cum ka talaga? Tangina it was that dangerous pala. Second, there will be times na hindi kayo compatible sa ka-fuck mo. Like for example is nung one time may naka-hookup ako na baliko medyo yung dick niya, hindi talaga siya maipasok miski sa missionary so I had to do cowgirl all the way.


 Naisip ko non, baka di compatible dick and pussy namin, kasi diba we have different forms and shapes. Kinda fascinating lang din. Then, naisip ko rin nito, paano if yung napangasawa mo hindi pala kayo compatible sa sex? Ang hirap siguro. For me kasi, sex is an art, it should be pleasurable for both parties. It's essential for me to know the sweet spot of my partner, or his/her desires. So if yung forte mo is rough, while yung partner mo e passionate gusto. Mahirap talaga. 


And I think isa rin to sa factor why nangyayari yung cheating, kasi hindi muna inaalam yung sexual desires nila (although may couple talaga na hindi big deal sex sakanila). Ewan ko, ang gulo na ang daming factors pero personally ito talaga pananaw ko. I believe dapat may sex education talaga, hindi lang siya nakakatulong to prevent pregnancy by knowing safe sex alone, but it also give us insights to discover more about ourselves and our desires. Wala pang mga abusadong lalaki na gagamiting emotional manipulation yung sex and intimate moments nila (putangina niyo sagad).  


Anyway, hindi rin naman ako mag-aasawa so kebers (unless girl I think). Scary to think lang. Ang scary ng mundo waahahaha.",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/1aupn9j/fuck_before_marriage/,t2_rytbc5dn2,2024-02-19 23:15:25,16,33
Sawa na ako maging Dom.,"I (24M) am very tired of the role of being the dom in bed. Don't get me wrong, when I'm in the mood I take it seriously and actually enjoy making my partner know her fucking place. But recently due to some unexpected events, I found myself getting even more excited being the one pinned down on my bed and actually get fucked. Like PROPERLY fucked. Now I just wanna make my partner happy but in a different perspective. If she wants to degrade and humiliate me, I'd be more than happy to offer her my body. She could slap me and even use my body as her personal ashtray and I'd still let her. This woman doesn't know the power she holds against me. I wanna be choked in bed and get slapped really hard if I do something that she doesn't like. This is my favorite part, if she's working from home, I just wanna sit down on the floor beside her chair and lay my head on her thighs. I wanna be treated not as an equal but as a pet to her. God damn. 

But it's not always the case sa kung sino magiging partner mo. Like, it still depends on how they present themselves sayo and how they act and all. Because I dated this one girl before I met my current girlfriend and she was acting all tough and I really was NOT feeling it and she slapped me real hard while she was on top of me and that really set me off. I got really pissed and I pinned her face and ass down on the bed and started railing her hard and really went to town smacking her ass. I wanted her to feel sorry for what she just did and (Honestly thank God talaga sa condom because I can last longer while wearing it HAHAHAHAHA) alam niyo yung angry sex? Yeah ganun nalang din nangyari. It was satisfying but boy did that shit triggered tf out of me. Can anyone relate with that or is it just me?

With all that being said, I am FUCKING FRUSTRATED SA GIRLPREN KO CUZ SHE DOESN'T KNOW HOW BADLY I WANNA BE ABUSED AND USED BY HER. (She does know but she doesn't want to because she's actually very sweet and kind person and is the fucking subby in our relationship) So here I am, ranting this shit cuz for the love of God GUSTO KO LANG NAMAN MAGKARON NG MOMMY AND HAVE SOMEONE TELL ME THAT I'M A GOOD BOY FROM TIME TO TIME IF I DO A GOOD JOB AT PLEASURING YOU.",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/16nrg2m/sawa_na_ako_maging_dom/,t2_hkzde7tf,2023-09-21 01:40:07,11,3
Doon sa nagflash ng Kiffy niya sa Isang Barista,"Nasubaybayan ko kasi yung kwento from Part 1 to Part 3.

Pero pag dating ko doon sa Part 3, nagkakausap na sila sa IG at inamin niya na sinasadya niya yung pag ""flash"" ng kiffy niya kay Kuyang Barista. Tapos sabi niya sa kwento... may jowa na pala siya. And she is still sending nudes daw doon sa Barista.

So I commented. (VERBATIM)

Me: Poor guy. Sobrang blue balls pala aabutin ni Kuyang Barista pag nalaman niya gang tingin lang siya.

Her:Well comments like these make us not want to continue on with this. May free show na, lugi pa din?

Me: Nun una ko nabasa yung kwento, kala ko naman single ka tapos you entice the guy with ""flashes"". Then next kwento, nagkausap kayo and sinabi mo na sinasadya mo mag ""flash"". Sa point of view ko and as a guy, ano papasok sa isipan diba?

He wants you for sure and you you still entice and flirt with him. Tapos sasabihin mo na may bf ka na pala and hanggang tingin lang pala siya. Kaya ko nasabing ""poor guy"". Kaya sana wag mong masamain. :D

Her: Sige so ano dapat kong gawin?

(Sa isip-isip ko, tanda mo na,  as you said, Doctor ka rin and it is your profession, ano ba sa tingin mo?)

Pero ito sinagot ko...

Me: Gagawin mo ba pag sinabi ko?

Her: Malamang hindi. Pero parang mas alam mo pa sakin dapat kong gawin eh. Anyway, have fun. Gonna ignore you altogether na lang. Thank you for ruining this.

Sasagot na sana ako kaya lang ni block niya na pala ako. Bakit ka mapipikon?  Hindi ka naman dapat mapipikon kung wala ka naman ginawang masama. Parang kasalanan pa namin kasi sabi mo nga sa post mo, nakikibasa lang kami. Oo nga, nakikibasa nga lang kami. Pare parehas naman  tayong Redditor dito, nakakabasa, nakakasulat, nakakacomment, and nakaka Upvote/Downvote, mapa AlasJuicy man or ibang subreddit. Kaya sana wag kang mapipikon. Sorry dami kong time para dito, kasi marami talaga akong time ngayon TBH.

Pero as Redditor, nagkakaroon din ng Checks and Balances, kaya nga nagawa yung Upvotes/Downvotes, mods, and comment section. Ngayon kung di mo kayang makakita ng criticism, pag-isipan mo post mo.

Ito ah... di ako nagmamalinis. May times na kupal din ako sa Reddit. And kapag sa tingin ko di maganda nasabi ko or napost ko, nakakatanggap ako ng downvotes and comments. It's either mag apologize ako or delete ko na lang kung di ko kayang ma-take or pag feel kong maging sarcastic, sumasagot ako, or just let it be.

Pero di mo kami mapipigilan lahat na makapuna sa ibang Redditors. Yung pissing kink mo nga wala ka naman narinig sa akin. Yung pag post mo ng vid na dumadaloy yung ihi mula sa kiffy mo wala kang narinig sa akin. Siguro sa iba, nakatanggap ka ng downvotes or something. Pero wala naman ako issue dun.

I just expressed myself na ""Poor Guy"" si Kuyang Barista. Kahit naman ako pag binulatlatan ng kiffy magugulat lalo na kung hot yung nagbulatlat. Tapos lalandiin ako? Fck. Pero poor guy naman talaga pag nalaman niyang may jowa ka pala.  Pero sabi mo nga lucky pa rin siya kasi nabulatlatan ng kiffy at balak mo ayain manood ng live show niyong magjowa pero never siya makakahawak.

Okay. Sige, sa point of view mo swerte siya. Sa point of view ko, iba pa rin.

Mabuti sana kung sinabi mo muna intention mo at pinaalam mo sa kanyang may jowa ka at gusto mo lang pala ng watcher, baka mag-iba pananaw ko.

Kaso di mo mapipigilan mga kapwa mo Redditor. Pwede mo kaming ma block kung annoyed ka. Which is btw ginawa mo sa akin. Hehe

Halimbawa nalang dito sa Reddit pag may nag post ng Incest Stories or Cheating kinks, or Child Abuse stories tapos proud pa, expect mo na na mad downvote siya or pupunahin ng kapwa niya Redditor or take down ng Mods.

Ganun din siguro pagdating sa mga pino post natin. Kaya wag kang mapipikon kung medyo totoo naman sinasabi nasasabi ko.

At kung iniisip mo na ipapagawa ko sayo ay i fuck si Kuyang Barista, nagkakamali ka.

Ito dapat next comment ko bago mo ako block...

Matanda ka na at Doctor ka just like you've said. Sabi nga sa sinumpaan niyo, "" I will abstain from harming or wrong doing any man by it."" Alam mo na tama sa mali so alam mo na gagawin. Nakakahiya naman na ako, patiente lang, tapos ako magsasabi ng gagawin sa Doctor. Eh  ikaw to ang may mas mataas ang pinag-aralan. 

Pero kanya kanya naman talagang trip yan. Sige, kung yan gusto mong gawin. Basta ako, inexpress ko lang sarili ko as a Redditor. Pwede mo rin sabihin na inexpress mo lang din sarili mo pero sana tignan natin kung nasa lugar or kung may nasasagasaan or may mali sa post. And this time, si Kuyang Barista yun. Kaya ko nasabing ""Poor Guy"" siya, dahil sa pinaggagawa sa kanya. 

Ayun lang. Di ako nagmamalinis ah. Just expressing myself lang talaga as a Redditor.

Sorry at sadyang dami ko talagang time rn. :P

Edit: so nag delete na siya ng previous posts niya raw.  And di na raw siya magpopost dahil sa akin.

So sa akin pa sinisi? Tandaan mo if you are pointing a finger balik sa'yo tatlo. Ang egocentric naman and you are being Histrionic, imo.
And doon sa pagmessage ko sa'yo, balewalain mo na. May jowa ka naman pala e. 😅

He is not the Tito I know - or so I thought ,"This was supposed to be a juicy story with Tito but I am afraid that it is not. 

We both decided to spend the night together. I checked in first since he is still at work. When I arrived at the room, I forgot to buy water, lube and other essentials which I did not bother going back outside since it was hot outside and my head throbbed again - something that I have been enduring since yesterday due to series of meetings outside office and interviews I had to attend to and lack of sleep. I took a nap. 

After a good two hours Tito knocked. I went back to lying down and since he came from work, he took a shower. Next thing I know, he was beside me. He hugged me and kissed me  very quick and he asked for a bj. I obliged. I gave him a lengthy, sloppy bj and even deepthroated him. My head was still throbbing but I did not mind - hearing his moans of pleasure kept me going. After a while, he made me lie down and finger fucked me for more or less 10 seconds before he slid his dick inside me. He came fast. It was a blur for me but seeing him finish made it ok. We washed and we lay in bed. I slept for I don't know how long but the next thing I know, he was ordering grab and food panda for dinner. 

While waiting - it said 30 minutes before the food arrives and I was just watching Netflix on my phone. I was lying face down with a pillow while watching a series. He went on top of me (while I was still watching Netflix) and Tito started fondling my boobs. He kept on kissing my neck and I tried telling him that the food delivery is due for 15 minutes or less. He told me that, ""Wala pa lage na (Wala pa yan)"". What he did took me by surprise. He stood up and dragged my cycling shorts. Ok a quickie. Just when I thought his dick would be entering my pussy, he entered in the wrong hole. It was my anus. We had no lube. His whole weight was on me and he was holding my hips while I exclaimed in fear and pain, ""Tito ayaw tito. Sakit."" But he proceeded in entering me from behind and he forced his dick on my anus. I buried my face on the pillow I was holding and cried incessantly, ""Tito tama na, sakit na kaayo. Tama na tito please."" I don't know what's gotten into him. The caring Tito I knew was taken over by an animal blinded with lust. He kept pounding on me, uttering, ""Tita lamia nimo uy. Guot kaayo ka"". I don't know how long it went. When he finished and came, he told me that he will remove his dick and when he did, it was painful. I was sore. 

He went to the bathroom and I was left in bed. Curled and blankly staring at the walls. Phone rang and food has arrived and he went outside, oblivious of me. I went inside the shower room and tears can't stop falling. When I went outside he was arranging the food. He called me. I sat down and he just asked if I was ok and why am I quiet. I just told him, ""Ayaw rako i-mind Tito. Kaon lang ta."" While eating, he was the usual Tito. Jolly, full of stories. Maybe he came from a long day at the resto, maybe he was stressed. But I can't seem to find it in me to smile again and be jovial.

I felt empty. We finished eating and we slept. While he slept soundly, I was curled up. I felt cold inside. I kept on crying silently and it was as if yesterday when it was my estranged husband was with me. Yes I was physically, emotionally and sexually abused by my husband. Memories of him punching me in the stomach and hurting me and afterwards cajoling me to have sex - thinking it would ease the pain he caused me flooded me last night. I was back to being that girl five years ago - scared, anxious and broken. 

I did not leave. We never had sex again. I told Tito that I am not feeling well. I did not cuddle with him. He left first. He had to prepare for work. I was left in the room, feeling nothing but emptiness. 

Yeah, that's all. Maybe that will be all for now. It was as if the person who posts here with pictures of food, book reviews and sound advices are all gone in a snap of a finger. :(

Edit: We did anal last time. But not to the point where he finished and I was well lubricated that first time. What happened last night - we don't have any lube and it was a first that he came just by entering me from behind.

A different aspect of safe sex,"While I don't support the views of a certain redditor's contentious post, I think they did bring up a topic that's important to discuss. 

Meeting up with strangers (whether for one on one fun, threesomes, orgies or gangbangs) inherently carries risks. Ranging from unmet expectations and disappointments, sexually transmitted infections, and on the extreme end, possible abuse even posing a threat to life, you wouldn't really know for certain. 

I usually screen potentials carefully. I'm not one to give my handles, and I wouldn't mind delaying meeting up to first get a feel if he/she isn't raising any red flags. I also never do meetups near my residence or place of work. And aside from having my own stash of condoms, I also keep pepper spray near me at all times.

Nagparaos ako sa... what the f*ck,"Magpapaantok lang dapat ako e so I decided makipaglaro muna with my trusty battery operated friend, Piglet

Habang nilalabas pasok ko si Piglet sa 😺 ko, nagsearch na din ako ng erotica pang ulam. I went for my usual search terms like ""pinagsawaan"", ""tito"", ""young-old"", ""non consent"". Though I do not tolerate abuse irl, di ko alam bakit yun ang to go theme ko when it comes to erotica and porn. 

Dahil diyan nahanap ko si Mang Gusting, Justin, at Jessica. Ayun na nga, sarap na sarap nako while imagining yung mga ginagawa ni Mang Gusting kay Jessice na sobrang lalim ng tulog sa kalasingan or dahil pinainom ng kung ano..  Ninanamnam ko yung pakiramdam na ako yung binabayo, hinihipo, dinidilaan. Lalong nakakalibog habang naiisip ko yung panggigil nung matanda.

Labas pasok yung toy ko sabay sa tempong nasa kwento. Hanggang sa yan na, shit, creampie pa sa walang kamalay malay na matres ni Ate Jessica... Sarap sa feeling, girl. Feeling ko yung keke ko yung tinamuran sa sarap kaka imagine...

Sexual Harassment,"

Hello guys! This happened noong grade 6 ako. There is this pretty girl na kaklase ko and we're not close btw and I barely even talk to her. And one time me and my friends were messing around doing something stupid like nagsisipaan ng bayag whilst in class hahahaha. Ehh yung girl kasi katapat ko lang on the other side of our table katabi ng friend na kaldyaan ko kaya nakita nya yung ginagawa namin then natawa sya and she gave me this look na parang may gusto syang gawin sakin. 


Tapos nung sumunod na araw habang gumagawa kami ng activity she removed her shoe and started pressing her feet in my dick naka kagat labi pa sya while doing it and nagulat ako tumingin ako sa kanya. Sabi ko ng pabulong kasi andun teacher namin hoy ano ginagwa mo?! Sabi niya  Masarap ba? And sabi ko tigil mo nayan nakakahiya tapos sinabi niya di naman tayo makikita ehh. And then ayun ginawa parin nya the whole day! Then ayun ginawa nya sakin to every day sa school tapos sinabi pa nya na umungol daw ako habang ginaganon niya ako kahit na nag didiscuss teacher namin! Pag di ako nag momoan nilalakasan niya yung pag press sa bayag ko! Shett hahahaha. 



Then eventually nalaman ng friend ko na ganun yung ginagwa sakin ng girl pero di  naman sya nag sumbong pinagkalat nya lang sa tropa nya atsaka sinabi din nya sa little sister nung girl tapos nagalit sakin yung kapatid kinurot kurot ako tapos sinasapak ako  sabi eh bat ko daw ginanon ate nya! Then ayun sabi ko wala akong ginawa siya yung may ginawa sinasalat niya kako ari ko. Di naman sya naniniwala sinasapak parin nya ako and kinukurot hanggang sa mag kasugatsugat na mga braso ko wala naman akong magwa ayoko naman manakit ng bata tinakbuhan ko na lang hahahaha. Then the day after that ayun di ko na pinansin yung babae. 



Oh and the worst part about this is that nag aaral kami sa catholic school!
 I will forever remember this moment hahahaha kasi not only this was my first time having sexual contact with another person it's also the only one and in my opinion is considered sexual harassment.",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/zbau3g/sexual_harassment/,t2_uq8esnup,2022-12-03 15:40:22,6,5

Don’t take it for granted 🤦‍♂️,"Let me preface this post by saying that I am not a perfect man, actually I’m far from it , and honestly, I know that I have a lot to improve on as a part of my gender

But……

In saying that……

I really despise men who take women and aspects of their relationships/connections they have with the latter for granted. 

Through my life and based on research and experience, on a very fundamental level, women nowadays value 3 things the most:

-1. They value being heard and acknowledged. This includes men listening to them when they say STOP and NO to things. There is a difference between a playful and pakipot NO and STOP and a woman exerting and expressing her boundaries. I have heard countless women tell me how they were forced into situations na they really didn’t want to engage in sexual activity that they’re not willing to do and yet, since “Nandito na tayo”, they were forced to do it. Which leads me to the next point,

-2. They value their comfortablility, security and safety around men above all. Is it enough that the guy has his own place or his own car? Is it enough that he’s pogi or their type? No, what’s important, even above those things is how they feel when they are around men. Do they feel safe? Do they feel threatened or in fear na baka ma abuse sila? Jusko, ang dami dami ng nakikidnap and na re-rape ngayon. Please at least make it a point that the woman beside you, whether you’re in a relationship or hook up lang yan, feels absolutely safe, secure and comfy. Which leads me to my last point,

-3. Lastly, they value not being taken for granted. The privilege of having a woman grant a guy access to her body and even just spending time with her should never ever be taken for granted. Most men don’t realize this. Hindi porket hubad na yung babae sa Harap ng lalake and she’s sucking your cock, you have the license to think na “She’s my bitch and she needs my cock”. No, guys should be thankful that a woman would allow them to touch and do things with their bodies. Your dick is not a gift that women crave for.

Why am I saying these things? Anong point ko? 

Kasi I’ve been seeing a lot of men take the women they’re with, in any capacity whether it’s a wife, gf, fling, Fubu or Feb, for granted. A lot of men think na “akin na siya and I can do anything I want”, even to the extent na they abuse, take advantage and even hurt the woman.

Kagabi, I probably talked to 3-4 women na had similar experiences with guys. “Wala na eh, nasa room na kami, hubad na kami, so ginawa nalang namin kahit masakit”. Remember that there is a world of difference between reality and porn. So unless the woman wants to see herself or play that role, remember that a naked woman who is in bed with you isn’t a fucking porn star. 

Remember that from an early age, women have always been taught to keep their honor/innocence/virginity intact. They have been trained to guard themselves because “madaming sira Ulo diyan”, and yet they muster up all their bravery and courage and they allow a guy to touch their bodies, Tapos gagaguhin lang? Shame. 

Again, I’m not a perfect guy, far from it even. But I’m confident in saying that we need better men in society.

That’s why I made a promise to myself na never to take for granted each and every woman who gives me the privilege of talking, calling, fooling around or sleeping with them. Women deserve better, they are God’s best creation, they are loving and caring by nature, and the last thing they need is to be taken for granted.

I miss her.,"I need to vent out some of my depression tonight. Anyways my name is RC. Not really my real name but it's sneaky nickname to my realname. Anyways let me share my story of being mentally abused in relationship.

(PS: PRETTY LONG POST SO ENJOY IF U CAN LOL)

Loving someone is amazing especially when that person you are with both just have that spark. That perfect click you have with each other well soo i thought. I loved this girl so much to the point i sacrificed my time, effort,and ""MORALITY"" for this girl.

She was toxic in some areas but i was in terrible situation which is called ""UNCONDITIONALY IN LOVE"". This means i didn't care if she was toxic, i didn't care if she would hit me we argued, I didn't care if she would mentally abused and verbally assault me, Jesus Christ you have no idea how many times i have said sorry to this women even though it was her fault at those arguments. my pride was as low as it could get i was basically  in her grasp.

But she wasn't always like that, i mean i must sick fuck that likes being tortured if that's the reason i fell in love with her. She made it very clear she was Bipolar meaning she has different moods etc, like different kinds of personality and i was prepared for that. I didn't care even though she be littled me at times i wasn't there just for the good times but fir the bad times aswell, i was willing to go through that because losing her was much worse in my opinion. She was my best friend, my first ever true love i guess.

I did everything in my power to make sure she was happy, if she was in bad mood i would just obey her, if she wanted me to be more mature and if she found many pet peeves she didn't like about me and if she critiqued me as person I would not be Offended and say yes I'm really sorry. She was a bit of a control freak i guess.

You must wondering right now why i didn't just abandoned her like dude ""Bobo ka ba napaka toxic nyan"". Everyone said that to me but I didn't care. Because one night, one Saturday day night of drinking, she said to me while we were both drunk, she kept saying a lot mean things to me while she was drunk, the usual, but when i started to say how i really love her a lot, and didn't understand why she was always being a bitch to me. She sat on the floor with a serious face, and said those words that i stuck to me throughout the relationship

""Wag mo ako iiwan please"".. i was screwed lol, how in the hell was i going to abandoned someone like that after hearing that. The time she nearly tried to kill herself i was there, the only time i got really angry Because i told her she was being stupid for trying to get hit a by fucking Bus.

I was kinda like servant at times, i made sure she was happy, i made sure she knew how beautiful she was, i made sure to remind her that she wasn't useless.. but just like any servant when the time comes that ur master is done with you.. they will throw you away and that's what happen.

After one argument over some silly thing she got rid of me.
It has been 6 months ever since our last communication and until this day i still miss her, not as much as before i mean i was able heal a little bit i mean i nearly tried to kill myself during those 6 months of her never speaking to me again but I I'm okay now

There are just some times i remember her and the great moments we had, the make out sessions at work, the great sex we had...but most importantly just the simple kilig moments, the times we spent together was amazing to say the least. 

The worst part is even though i remember the many toxic things she did to me...i can't get angry, i still miss her.

Unconditional love really hurts.",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/iyj6kd/i_miss_her/,t2_6epsg2lr,2020-09-24 05:07:50,10,8
"To all men & women, what are the kinks na you are too embarrassed to tell people?","I'm 23 F. Let this post be a judgement-free one, ok. I just wanna know ano ang kinks nyo ding di mapag-usapan with other people kasi baka ijudge kayo. Ako, I'm so into -

1) Incest: Ang nakakapagpacum talaga sakin is daddy-daughters/kuya-bunso/uncle-pamangkin fantasies. Something about this man you look up to and holds a certain level of authority sexually abuses you is so FUCKING HOT for me. Lalo na yung tandem na daddy & tito minamanyak ka. Sinisilipan ka pag nasa cr or tinitigasan pag wala kang bra sa bahay. Or aamuyin panties mo na gamit na from school, pagjajakulan. Mamanyakin ka sa gabi pag tulog ka. Magooffer tulungan ka mag-insert ng tampon para lang makita yung batang bata mong pussy up close. 

2) Consensual non-consent: sobra akong nalilibugan sa pasimpleng manyak, or yung in the middle of the night papasok sa kwarto tas huhubaran ka tas pagjajakulan ka. Next night, hahawakan ka na. Tas magigising ka nlang na finifinger ka na o kinakain ka na pero di ko makagalaw. O kaya kakantutin ka pag tulog. Something about being taken advantage pag unconscious or (consensually) against ka makes me so wet. Bilang na rin siguro dito yung mamanyakin ka sa mga situation na di mo akalain. Like kunyari habang minamasahe ka, pati pala pussy mo mamasahihin na or kaya pag ang doctor chinecheckup ka, tas papahigain ka sasabihin kasama sa checkup. Then ffingerin ka na. 

*medyo borderline rape fantasy na din siguro ako. Yung talagang (consensually) against your will and forced tas aggressive tapos matinding aftercare pagtapos. 
* sleep assault >>>
* also applies sa massage groping, yung what is expected to be an innocent one, naging biglang iba na lamas sa pwet mo and then umaabot na sa singit. Tapos sobrang tease na matagal dumaan sa gitna ng pussy mo. By then sobrang naglalawa ka na sa wetness mo and sa oil. 

3) Free use: yung bang anytime na gusto kang kantutin, kakantutin ka. Kunyare nagaaral lang ako or nagbabasa nang nakadapa, biglang lalaruin pussy ko hanggang sa mawet ako. Tas iffuck na ko prone bone style. Or kunyari naghuhugas ako ng pinggan, tas biglang kakainin ako then iffuck sa kitchen. As in anytime talaga. Knowing na lagi silang libog sayo, tangina sarap.

4) Breeding: takot ako mabuntis pero tangina pag in the moment ka tas sasabihin sayo na ""bubuntisin kita"" bakit sobrang nakakalibog?! And yung feeling na nilabasan sila sa loob mo, tas papanoorin nila magleak yung liquid pagpullout. Fuck.

5) Older men: mainly because it kinda makes the #1 feasible, like calling them daddy or tito. Feel ko kasi, I'm giving them the chance din to fuck a young fresh pussy tapos ako naman, I get to experience a guy who has waaay more years of experience in sex. Oldest I've fucked was 45 I think and ang tawag ko pa sa kanya is Tito. I think papatol ako as far as 55 lalo na kung young-looking and young-stamina. 

6) MFM: I like being the center of attention of two guys. Gusto ko yung feeling na libog na libog sila saking dalawa tas gusto akong babuyin but at the same time be treated like their princess and iprioritize na magcum muna ako ng madaming beses bago nila ko salit-salitan kantutin. 

7) Cuckolding / being hotwifed: like my guy lets me get fucked by other guy. Yung papatakamin nya yung iba habang minamanyak ako, tas pag nasa mood he'll let guys grope me. A redditor here converted me into liking this fantasy wherein my dad and his dad fucks me at the same time while he's watching as a boyfriend. Tas both sila magccum on / in me. Daddies I truly trust. Damn huhu incest + old + MFM in one tapos nanonood boyfriend ko (single ako)

8) Lolicon: not into child pornography ha (that draws the line). Pero something about lolicon hentai na tangina, pag yung kuya kinakantot younger sister nya ng tulog, parang sana may kuya din akong ganon. Or lalo na yung nakabihis student pa. FUCK. 

9) Getting cheated with: yung mga married husbands type na suot pa yung ring pag kinakantot ka. Something about them doing something bawal with you. Tapos yung sasabihin ko na, ""ginagawa ba to ng asawa mo? Sarap na sarap ka sa puke ko tito/daddy?"" Basta yung thought na you're sexually satisfying him better tapos hayok na hayok sya sayo. 

10) Opening my pussy and staring at it: gustong gusto ko yung feeling of exposure na sinispread open pussy ko tas tititigan then duduraan. Parang sobra akong binabastos at hinuhubaran. 

11) Degradation + praise kink: gustong gusto ko yung pinapamukha sakin na ang libog ko ""tignan mo oh, basang basa ka na. Tangina ka ang libog mo pala. Para kang puta."" TAPOS may halo nang compliments ""tangina ang ganda mo pag sinusubo mo tite ko / ang galing mong kumantot, sakin ka lang ha"" parang it's the confusion of feelings pag dinedegrade ka tas ippraise ka na nakakaadik. 

Ano sa inyo?

PS. I keep adding as I read your comments and realize na gusto ko nga din pala nun HAHAHA",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/13djv81/to_all_men_women_what_are_the_kinks_na_you_are/,t2_e2dj8asu,2023-05-10 15:58:42,335,248
trauma response,"trigger warning: sexual abuse

I'm f(21) at ang taas na ng body count ko.

i was 13 years old nung minolestya ako ni papa. 3 times. muntik na siyang umuna saken. 

yung una, nagising nalang ako tas finifinger nya ko. tas hinalikan pa ko. nabigla ako. malabo na si mama at papa nun. nanlalake kasi si mama. well, nauna papa ko. may anak na agad sya sa labas kapapanganak palang sakin. balik tayo sa kwento. ayun, finifinger nya ko tas hinalikan pa ko. di pa nagpaawat, nilamas din dede ko. 

2nd, pinahawak nya saken ano nya. pinahandjob nya hanggang sa labasan sya. nakakadiri putangina.

3rd, kinain nya ko, hinalikan ako. binantaan pa ko na papatayin daw siya nila mama pag nalaman yung ginagawa nya saken. nagdry hump pa sya saken. 

katapos nun, sinumbong ko na sya. di ko na kinaya. nagsabi na ko may mama. iyak nang iyak si mama. want nila pakulong si papa di ako pumayag kasi ayokong bumisita mga kapatid ko sakanya. tapos tuwing nagagalit si mama saken, lagi nyang sinasabi na siguro gustong-gusto ko ginawa nya saken. punta na raw ako kay papa pabuntis na ko. dahil din dito kaya di ako masyadong open kay mama.

hindi lang yun, yung tito ko rin na asawa ng kapatid ni mama. hinaharass ako, pinahawak rin ano nya saken habang pinapakita yung porn na pinapanood nya. sobrang weak ko. sobrang nakakaputangina ng mga nangyari saken. buti nalang namatay na sya, asset ng pulis e (drugs)

years passed, nawalan ako ng virginity. laging nakikipaghook up kung kani-kanino. nakikipagmeet and fuck. pinasok ko na rin alt3r dahil sa financial difficulties. nagpapab##k, nagbebenta ng c#ntents. lahat nagawa ko na siguro. pero now im working na sa bpo industry and doing well na.

akala ng iba nympho ako, akala nila sex addict ako. pero hindi e may something ako na hinahanap e. yung ibang nakasex ko di ko naman ginusto. labag sa loob ko yung iba. go with the flow nga lang talaga ako. i cant say no. minsan uuwi akong tulala or umiiyak. ang fucked up. want ko nalang magpakamatay talaga hahaha.

idk pero nagkaroon ako ng rape kink and i always date and mas prefer ko yung older sakin ng 5-10 years.

never din ako nagpacheck-up about this pa, idk how. idk if pasok din ba sya sa hmo? haha sorry bobo.",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/18370os/trauma_response/,t2_i30t65qnh,2023-11-25 08:42:04,22,4
"Once you go big, you'll never go back","No this isn't a post about dick sizes. With the number of posts looking for petite chinitas, I thought I'd share my opinion about my experience with women (and one particular body size)


I know we've all be conditioned by commercial media on what sort of women, particularly their body shape, we should find sexually desirable. I mean, just looking at all these glorified sex icons, we boys (and maybe anyone within the spectrum) at one point or another have dreamt of being with Sydney Sweeney, Ana de Armas, or Paris Hilton if you even like that. Of course they look amazing. But apart from that, we've all been conditioned to see them as hyper sexually desirable too.


I used to think that way. Manic pixie dream girl, glasses, smol build, easily carried, can be lifted up your shoulder for that standing face-sit, can be lifted in front of the mirror, or a large floor to ceiling window, for that voyeuristic viewing pleasure. That was until I met my first big girl.


She was shorter than me, weighed heavier than me, and big everywhere. Her face was to die for. And she had such soulful eyes that carried both bubbly happiness and abused sadness, like she was Joy placed in a world where everyone was programmed to think of her as undesirable and make her feel unwanted.


I was immediately taken in.


I treated her like a queen outside, never made her pay for anything, listened to her stories, made her laugh all the time. Behind closed doors, she was my slut, my sub, and ultimately, the fulfillment of my desires. I could do whatever I wanted with her, whichever way, wherever. 


She felt amazing; soft, sturdy, very very sensitive. 


We would fuck for hours and she'd always be wet. I would twist her like a pretzel and she'd always jerk when she came. I'd thrust as hard as I wanted to and she'd take them all, those long, hard, deep thrusts, from any angle. That constant thump, thump, thump, for minutes and hours on end, bringing her to close to orgasm and pulling out just before she came, or pounding incessantly while rubbing her clit while she came uncontrollably, almost passing out.


The view was the best; plump, flushed red cheeks, jiggling, bouncing huge breasts, heaving tummy, thicc legs, god pussy, fucking gorgeous ass. I would eat andlick, every crevice I could find.


She only ever rode me once and I never asked her to do it again. Yes because of the weight, but not because she was heavy. That feeling when you have a big girl sitting on your cock, forcing her weight down on you, making every inch of your shaft go deeper and deeper into her, head pushing against her back wall, and then lifting up a few inches and crashing back down against the base of your cock, wringing you dry as you shoot up every single drop of your cum inside her, feeling her breasts against your chest, her tummy on yours, arms around your neck, skin to skin. Bounce. Bounce. Bounce. Bounce. And all I can say was. ""Pu"". ""Tang"". ""I"". ""Naaaa"".. before clutching at her hard and kissing deeply, trying to add more weight, straining, welding at the point where her pussy met my cock.


I only lasted 5mins. Maybe 4 and a half, if I'm a little more honest.


They say once you go black, you can't go back. I say the same for Big, Beautiful Women.",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/1076g4t/once_you_go_big_youll_never_go_back/,t2_m2qkyh61,2023-01-09 14:01:08,23,11
Am I worthy of my sugar baby?,"Disclaimer that this post doesnt contain juicy scenes.

I'm 33 years old and she's 25. We met in phr4r when she posted na she's looking for someone na itatakas daw sya. I messaged her thinking she meant to have fun for the night. As we went along, she's looking for a place pala talaga to stay in exchange for sex (where she said na she's petite and has really nothing to offer but a hole. Haha). I didnt plan on adopting her at all pero ang sarap nya kasing kausap. Haha.

She said she wont tell her story unless she's sure na willing daw yung kausap nya to take her. We exchanged photos and I must say, wala sa itsura yung gagawa sya ng kabulastugan. She's beautiful pero yung simple. Yung tipo ng ganda na gugustuhin mo, di yung pagnanasaan mo. Gents alam ko gets nyo ko. Wala sa itsura nya yung mag ooffer sya to be a sugar baby. At yun mismo yung masarap alagaan eh, yung mukhang inosente pero wild pala.

We agreed na sakin na sya magsstay and she then started telling her story, which I wont share of course. We exchanged details and set the date sa pag ampon ko sa kanya. Haha. She even added “Penge rin ako ng food mo a” Damn this brat, little did she know I was planning to spoil her to the best I can after knowing her story. 

Fast forward, sinundo ko sya sa province nya and inuwi ko sya sa condo. I have to say, lakas ng appeal nya in person. She's a student from Big 3 kaya ang talinong kausap. We spent the rest of the day talking and discussing our set up. She'll stay sa condo ng 6 months doing nothing but her thesis and being my sugar baby. She wasnt asking for money, food lang and place to stay. But of course I didnt let it happen. In exchange for of course, sex. Also, gusto nya exclusives kami. Selosa daw sya sa lahat ng bagay. Pucha bratty a. 

On her first night, I didn't touch her. Gusto ko maging komportable muna sya sa place at sakin. Next day, I had to work and went home nang late kaya nagdala na lang ako ng food for our dinner. Naligo na ko and we decided to sleep. Tabi kami sa bed ko. I reached for her stomach and circled my finger sa navel nya. I pulled her closer to me and whispered “It's time”, she nodded. I kissed her gently and tucked her hair sa ear nya. We continued kissing while my left hand reached for her boob. She gasped and ramdam ko yung kaba nya kasi nanginginig yung kamay nya nang kaunti. I stopped and asked her kung okay lang sya, she said yes. Inisip ko baka dahil di sya komportable sakin kaya kabado. I stopped, sabi ko it can wait. She insisted and said “Fuck me, I want it. But make it gentle”. Come on, sinong tatanggi sa grasya? Haha. 

My lamp was on and kita namin ang isa't isa. When I was entering her, she held me tightly and said “Ang talim”. I could tell she was hurting so bad, at ramdam ko ang sikip. Ang sakit pero ang sarap kasi ang sikip. Nung halos mapasok ko na lahat, nasasaktan pa din sya. Nagduda na ko, I pulled my dick out and checked. Putangina, she lied to me about her doing it with her ex before. There was blood. She was a virgin. I was supposed to feel lucky and even more horny pero hindi. Naisip ko ganon sya kadesperate to get out of her situation. Naawa ako at nakonsensya nang sobra. I took advantage of her. She kept on apologizing for lying. I didn't speak, naawa lang ako at nanghinayang. We ended the night feeling sorry for each other. 

After that night I didnt plan on doing the deed with her anymore. But as her stay on my condo went on, I can't help but fall for her. While on my resto, lagi ko syang pinapanood sa cctv with a smile. Excited akong umuwi lagi, natuto akong gumawa ng oatmeal recipes para sa kanya, nasusulit ko na ang Netflix dahil sa panonood namin ng anime, crime documentaries at kdrama, inalam ko kelan dapat 320mm, 280mm at 230mm, I started being a suki ng mga dessert at flower shops, and lastly I started being loyal and not wanting to sleep around with others. Imagine a 32 year-old posting photos of hands interlocked, photo of a woman with her face covered by her hand, a part of her face with a song playing in the backgound. Tinamaan tangina. Haha.
Who wouldn't fall for her anyway? She's the closest to perfection. This world just abused her.

On her last month sa condo ko, wala pa ding nangyari samin. We acted as if we're in a relationship talaga, the only difference is patago. Tinago nya ko, which is expected I know. Of all the times when we're drowing in love and we'd catch each other's eyes, she's always the first to break. When I tell her she can stay as long as she wants to, she always responds “6 months is enough”. I attempted several times to ask if we can just be in a relationship instead since we're happy, she'd end it with “Baliw”. 

9 days before she leaves is my birthday. She used the money I gave her from the start in buying me gifts and reserving places for us to celebrate. Damn. She made me happy, if not the happiest. We spent the night in a resort in Tagaytay. We decided to leave the pool by 9:30 pm. We went to our room and naghubad sya sa harap ko. She said “Let me own you”. For the past 6 months, puro jabol lang ako puta. Nung sinabi nya yon tangina bat ako magpapakipot? I kissed her aggressively and I won't share the details anymore because I treasure that moment at ang sarap solohin. We did it. She owned me just as I owned her. It was lovemaking. But this isn't a fairytale, guys. Haha


5 days before she leaves, I couldn't help myself anymore. I started talking about love, relationship and even marriage. She'd always shut the idea down. I begged her to stay one more month, I was rejected. Her actions contradict her words. I feel her love, pero di ko magets why she won't give in. I told her na tutulungan ko syang i fix lahat ng problema nya. Sasamahan ko sya sa lahat. Pero wala. On the day na ihahatid ko sya, I finally asked “Don't you love me?” she answered “I needed you”. And it was enough for me. Hinatid ko na sya sa province nya and left money sa bag nya without her knowing. Nung bababa na sya sa sasakyan, I held her hand and kissed it. She looked away and said thank you. I let go and watched her go. Umiyak ako tanginang yan. Binaybay ko yung Nlex nang umiiyak at sumasabay sa the man who cant be moved. Haha. 

Days went by nang sobrang sakit. Ang hirap pigilan yung sarili ko na magreach out sa kanya pero kinaya ko para sa ikatatahimik nya. Di sya palapost kaya wala akong mastalk. Wala akong balita. Yung mga gabi kong masaya naging puro alak. Bawat sulok ng condo ko sya nakikita ko. Tangina sobrang sakit.

Last week (4 months after she left), 8 am someone's calling me, uknown number. I answered and boom. Tumigil yung mundo ko, nanginig ako. I missed her so much. She said nasa Taguig daw sya, pwede daw ba syang dumalaw. Fuck the marupok tito, I said susunduin ko sya. Haha. There we were, sitting again sa condo ko. Her reason of pagdalaw is yung pagbalik ng money with interest as her gratitude for looking after her. Sabi ko “may gusto pa kong bumalik at sana gusto din nya”. She responded “gago” and laughed. I kissed her, it was a long deep kiss. She cried and said 

“Takot ako baka nabubulag lang ako. Baka di naman pala kita mahal. Pinapakinabangan lang. Pero bakit ang sakit nung umalis ako. Gustong gusto kitang balikan pero baka okay ka na” (not the exact words but I remember the thoughts dearly). Despite her saying that, she still left me with a “I won't come back. I don't deserve you”. But fuck it. Plano kong puntahan sya mamaya. Liligawan ko. I will earn her love. Kadiri bat ang cheesy putspa. Bahala na. Di ako pinatulog ng kaba tangina. 


This is my way of brushing the anxiety off, sharing. Haha. Wish me luck.",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/si4xkt/am_i_worthy_of_my_sugar_baby/,t2_j8wucs1r,2022-02-02 04:38:07,1682,186
Sanctuary's Lady in black,"This happened last Thursday night when me (30M) and my friend (30F) stayed in Makati for work, and we decided to try clubbing on Pobla's Sanctuary. And by the way, this is my first time going to the club, so my friend is just guiding me. I wore a decent clubbing clothes (I think?), a white long-sleeves fitted shirt, khaki pants, white rubber shoes, glasses, and a black cap. I jist eant to share my experience as a first timer and how culture shocked I am.

My friend and I arrived at the club a little after 12am of Thursday and fortunately even if we're just walk-ins, there is a table for the two of us. I believe that it was destined that there are a couple of high chairs and a table for us. LOL! We ordered 2 beers and started drinking. At first, I thought it was a normal bar with loud music, which I am also into. I liked the vibe and remixed music from the DJ.

After 30 minutes or so, my friend and I started to dance and sing while sitting and just feeling the vibe. Then there's this group of 5 people who sat beside us which is for groups that big. From what I can see, they are celebrating something and  they started taking shots, taking pictures and laughing. At first, my eyes were fixated on the lady who wears an orange tube top, as she smiles beautifully, and her eyes are pretty as well. Few minutes passed, I caught someone from their table looking at me and she keeps on looking at me even if I turn my gaze away from her. She is wearing a black top and black silky pants (i think?), she is definitely beautiful and almost as tall as I am (I'm 5'10). As time goes by, our eyes meet often and everytime that the lyrics of the song has the word ""you"" in it, she would point at me and she would smile at me. To be honest, at first I was creeped out and I told my friend that the girl keeps pointing at me. LOL! And she said ""That means she likes you! You should go ahead and talk to her!"", but as a ""club virgin"", I am too shy to approach anyone yet. 

Aftee a few moments, a group of Thai National guys (who literally look like they are in their late 30's, approached the girl's group and started partying with them. This girl in black started dancing with one of the guys and the guy who she dances with keeps on reaching for her waist and upper butt while dancing, but she's pushing his hands away. At that moment, I told myself ""Now, I'm safe and can continue drinking alone."" BUT THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT!

After a few more bottles of beer, I noticed that while my friend is dancing in front of me and vibing with the songs, the lady in black approached her and danced sexually with her. And not only that, she even guided my friend away from me so she could dance in front of me. She would turn her back on me and does a lap dance and humped me with her ass for a while. I'm not sure if my friend noticed that as she is also dancing and the Thai nationals are also dancing with them on the side. Believe it or not, I am being vigilant with my friend's condition as she might get abused by the other guys around her, and my reaction to what the lady is doing to me  is ""Mommy!!! My eyes and my brain!"" LOL! When they both called it off and rested, I told my friend that I will go to the restroom. As I pass the girl's table, she is talking to one Thai guy while standing. When I am on her back as I am walkimg away, she suddenly stepped back and leaned down on me (we almost fell as I was totally unprepared for that). When I tried to excuse myself, she held my hand for a brief moment, as if asking to pull her away from the conversation with the Thai guy. But slowly pulled my hand away and continued on my way to the restroom.

When I get back, I didn't see her and the Thai guys are bavk on their table so I thought she went downstairs to go the restroom as well, but she never came back to their table until we have to go back to our hotel. I wonder and hope that she's okay. And if ever she or her friends are here, hope we'll meet again. Sorry na if nagpakipot pa nung una.

DADDY ISSUES: An Experience-Based Analysis,"Ahh, one of the most fetishized archetypes ever. A lot of guys fantasize or think that having a girl with daddy issues makes her exciting (I'll get to some of the reasons in a bit). In reality, there is a darkness behind the veneer of excitement and fun that these ladies exhibit.

I've been reflecting on the women I've met in the field and I've noticed certain themes that I see across multiple women. The realization that, 'hey, I've seen this before!' This series is an attempt to condense and explain the types of women that I've met. I am sure that some of these archetypes will resonate with you, either because you've dated one or if you see them in you.

I will be releasing a couple of archetypes across a couple of posts because it will be quite detailed. I have 5 archetypes lined up:

1. [Subconsciously Attached to Ex](https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/155lsue/shes_still_attached_to_her_ex_but_shes_in_denial/)
2. [Anxious Attachers](https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/157ythp/if_i_dont_respond_or_miss_her_message_she_goes/)
3. [Daddy Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/15f2dm3/daddy_issues_an_experiencebased_analysis/)
4. [Classy Young Thing](https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/15f2dm3/daddy_issues_an_experiencebased_analysis/)
5. Angels

Today we will be focused on the ladies who are very loving, loyal, expressive but can get very demanding of attention and reassurance from you.

**Important disclaimer**: this post is not meant to disparage, criticize, or shame any female or females that fall within a certain archetype. These are merely my observations, personal experience, and reflections which I'd like to share. I learned something while interacting with these types of females, perhaps you can learn something from this too.

# Daddy Issues (Rare)

**Identification:** Getting involved with someone with DIs is... an experience. They spend a lot of time & money on their appearance, and based on looks alone, they usually look out of your league. When you show them attention, you get surprised that they reciprocate attention to you as well, even if you think you're an average guy. You continue to talk, then get intimate, then both agree to get together. You have your fun - it's super intense - but a few weeks later, it's over and she is now seeing a new guy.

**Profile Analysis:** I believe that Ladies with Daddy Issues (DI) fall under 2 types:

\- Type A: They tend to dress provocatively, usually playful or flirty with their language, post thirst traps on their socials, usually very DTF (usually bar is low with their partners), have vices (usually vaping, alcohol, some cases illegal substances), typically have partners that are at least 5 years older than them (usually they go for guys in their 30s+), and rotates partners frequently. Highly to engage in sex work.

\- Type B: Pays attention to their appearance, but generally dresses less provocatively. Not very DTF - looks for partners that will commit to them, and settles for low quality partners due to fear of abandonment.

I've had the most experience with ladies with the Type A variant of DI, so that will be the focus of this section.

What I've observed with ladies with DIs is that they are dopamine-hungry and constantly look for emotional highs, and their go to stimulus is male attention. They also are on a constant search for excitement & novelty, because they get bored easily, which means they like casting a wide net and putting themselves in situations (e.g. clubs, risky friend groups, etc.) where they can get maximum attention.

There's a key difference between a manipulative/narcissistic lady vs. a lady with DI. The manipulative/narcissistic lady thinks highly of themselves and they usually use attention/sex for an objective. They think of themselves as a precious resource and they are strategic in leveraging their sexuality.

The lady with DIs pursues dopamine hits and emotional highs above all else. The highs are the ultimate end for them and to pursue it, nothing is sacred. Their body isn't sacred, their partner isn't sacred, their relationship isn't sacred -- it doesn't matter to them as long as they get their hit. And I don't mean this in a 'sadgirl'/emo type of way, they're just indifferent to the implications and consequences of their actions. By the way, the intensity of the pursuit of these hits depends on the severity of the DI.

The common features that I've observed with the DI ladies I've met are a (1) lack of a father figure and a (2) lack of good female role models in healthy relationships. My hypothesis behind their behavior and mentality:

The lack of a father figure has distorted their view of themselves and their bodies/dignity. Good father figures often are trained to protect, nurture, and respect women, so they serve as a benchmark to their daughters of what a 'good man' is like and helps them develop a good sense of self. The lack of guidance leaves them vulnerable to negative influences (there's a lot these days), which leads to a lack of standards, boundaries, and addiction to these dopamine hits.

The lack of good female role models in healthy relationships means that they are not familiar with what is generally viewed as a 'proper' relationship - e.g. faithfulness, resolving conflicts, etc. So they tend to go with emotions/feelings and attraction when it comes to staying in relationships. They tend not to consider the dangers of staying in abusive relationships or discarding a proper - yet boring - partner.

**Additional Notes**: I strongly believe that those with daddy issues are at a huge long-term risk. Based on experience, their reward-seeking / hedonistic behavior puts them in a lot of risk. They expose themselves to a large number of men, and because of the law of large numbers and their lower standards, they have a higher-than-average chance of coming face-to-face with an abusive man.

The sad thing is that usually, their behavior doesn't stop with sleeping around. They also usually have one or both of either alcoholism and substance abuse, further exposing them to physical issues or risky situations.

**Personal Thoughts**: They are also most likely to be engaging in sex work to fund their lifestyle, given their high libido. Anecdotally, I had a fling with an escort who had severe Daddy Issues. Usually the reason for ladies who engage in sex work is because they need money for their family or pay for their education. It's always a means to an end, and most of them have a strong desire to quit immediately (source: I have handler contacts).

My fling's reason? ""I do it for fun. I feel loved whenever I'm in bed with a man because he gives me attention."" The next thing that she said: ""Men all just want the same thing. I might as well get something out of it."" That's not a healthy way of thinking. In more vulgar terms, that's fucked up.

(Side note: we didn't meet through a paid encounter. I may post about the experience in the future because it was a very interesting situationship. I will also walk through what my principle are towards sex work and paying for sex if I do make that post.)

Out of all the archetypes of females I've been with/dated, I feel the most sadness for those with legit daddy issues.

# Advice

**Ladies**

>I will be blunt here - if you have this issue, most likely you will acknowledge that you have DI but you will say that you do not care, because you're getting what you want, and that is the only thing you care about.

&#x200B;

>I will say though that time and gravity catches up to all of us. Your youthful beauty will not last forever. You may feel invincible and unstoppable now (I've been there when I was younger), thinking that you'll be different from the 'old people' who warn you. But we can never fully escape the consequences of our actions and time dispenses fair judgment.

&#x200B;

>You have value, and it's just not because of your outer beauty and sex appeal. Do not squander this value by exchanging it for fleeting emotional highs. I hope that you choose to invest in becoming a woman of true substance, where you do not view yourself as valuable as long as you are desirable to men. I'm rooting for you.

**Gentlemen**

>Have your fun and treat her well. Be the guy who treats like she should be treated. Etch the experience in your memories because your time with her will be very intense. But don't cling to her - she's not yours, it's only your turn.

&#x200B;

>From a broader standpoint, I hope that if you're a father, please treat your daughters well. Train them up in the way they should go. Be a good role model and be present in their lives so that they can see what a proper man looks like. It is not a guarantee that things like these will not happen, but it will make a difference in your daughter's life.",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/15f2dm3/daddy_issues_an_experiencebased_analysis/,t2_8368rfvik,2023-08-01 12:43:13,25,12
My First Bumble Experience,"Warning: Very long post.

I came from a toxic 10-year relationship and I think it's time for me to meet some new people. I've been single for a year now so why not? Growing up, I mostly listen to heavy music and my fashion sense was greatly influenced by it. I exclusively wear black at all times. This also made me have a certain liking towards goth girls.

My friends pressured me to try bumble. I was hesitant at first but last week, I finally gave in and installed it. I was surprised because there I received lots of likes in the first hour. To begin with, I am 26 years old, I kinda look nice, and I mentioned that I like cats and I collect perfumes. I think that attracted a lot of girls. Sadly, I am uninterested because I was looking for the goth-looking ones. I almost uninstalled it because I am losing interest. But after hours and hours of swiping, I finally found one. Then another one, aaaand another one. I was excited and hoping they swipe right too. Hours later, I finally received an alert that I got a match. Three of them messaged me. Goddamn, my heart was pounding.

I talked to the first girl. She was a band member and plays multiple instruments. The conversation was going well but I gotta admit, she was boring as hell. I lost interest and then moved on. The next girl was also boring too. I don't care if you are the prettiest creature in the world. If you aren't interesting, and you lack a sense of humor, I won't give a fuck about you. I was so disappointed that I almost didn't bother to reply to the last girl. Let's call her ""M""

M is really pretty. She looks like your typical asian goth girl. Colored hair, tattoos, nose piercing, heavy makeup. I was hoping that she'll be interesting. I tried talking to her and I already knew that this girl has the sense of humor I was looking for. It was Wednesday, January 4. She immediately asked for my telegram and we continued talking there for hours. I can't stop talking to her but I gotta go to work soo I said ""let's talk again tomorrow."" She agreed. The next day, I didn't even care much about work. I was too busy talking to her. I am so into her during that moment and I knew she likes me too. Every time I heard my phone, I immediately picked it up because I am so excited to talk to her. She was constantly sending me her selfies and oh boy I'm telling you she's hot. When I got home, she invited me for a call. I was scared but fuck it, this is my chance. Surprised, she's very eloquent. She sounded like your typical radio host. We talked for almost an hour. To summarize, this is her background:

* 21 years old
* 4'11
* chain-smoker
* abusive family
* bare minimum ex (she had 3 bfs, her last boyfriend has Erectile dysfunction, surprisingly they lasted for a year)
* lost her life savings because her ex invested it into a shady crypto firm
* left her house, abandoned her family, and is now staying with her friend for 3 months
* currently jobless
* I realized that she has a rich family (Dad's a government official, mom's a doctor)
* Currently studying pre-law.

Knowing her story, I got sad and very concerned regarding her current situation. But there I realized she's a very independent and strong woman. I also realized that she's very loyal, given her ex's condition, she still stayed faithful to him even though she mentioned she has a very high sex drive. She got my respect. But hours later, our conversation turned into something very sexual. She called this ""demon time."" It was around 3 am. She described how good she is in bed. I don't believe her but she jokingly said ""try me."" My heart pounded. I immediately changed the topic because I don't wanna be awkward. I told her ""are you sure you aren't catfishing?"" So she opened her camera. My jaw dropped. She's very cute. She asked me how was my sex life with my ex. I told her that I really lasted long whenever we had sex. She was the first to get tired and she always cum first.  I also mentioned that I'm a giver. Honestly, I can go on for hours eating my partner's pussy without them reciprocating. I think that made her really excited. I heard her voice begin to change from a cute girl talking to a serious girl who was really horny and curious. Her ""uhuhs"" became ""ughs."" I knew she was really into it because she kept on asking ""anong nangyari next?"", ""anong ginawa mo?"" in a very sexy manner. I told her that I didn't use any kind of protection within our 10 years"" She then told me ""safe ka sakin, nag pi-pills ako."" Goddamn this girl is wild.

She then invited me to meet her last Sunday, January 8. I agreed.

Days have passed and we still continue talking to each other. There I realized that she was really into me and she was really horny. It was Saturday already and she asked me if she could sleep in my room. I've got no problems with it but I told her ""nothing will happen and we'll just sleep."" She disappointingly said ""okay.."" (Call me lame. I know that I'm a horny guy but I really do not like having sex on the first meetup. To me, it doesn't feel right.) That night we continued talking about her experiences in life. I did really feel sorry for her. Her titos sexually abused her and her parents didn't even care for her. For a 21-year-old girl, she's been through a lot of shit. She sounded very mature. I almost didn't believe she was that young. She mentioned she likes furniture so I had the idea to bring her to IKEA. Our first date, sa IKEA. Weird but it's cute.

Sunday, January 8. The day of the meetup. It was a 30 min drive from my house to her subdivision. I went there very nervous and not knowing what to expect. Finally, I reached her place. I waited for 15 min. and at last, after 4 days of talking online, we finally met each other. I got really excited. She has purple hair, she wore a black denim jacket with a see-through shirt and a black bra, nose piercings, choker, complimented with fishnets and boots. Her boobs are big for a 4'11 girl. She opened her arms from afar while walking and immediately hugged me. ""mMmhHMmm you smell really good!"" she said. Disappointingly, she smelled like a cigarette. We drove from her place to Mall of Asia, we spent our day there walking and talking to each other. There I realized she's really low maintenance. We ate at a pricy pizza place and surprisingly, she didn't like it.  She only eats at jollibee and other fastfood chains. We had a good day. Fast forwarddd and it was already 8 p.m. and she kept on asking ""what time are we going to your place?"" as if she was hinting something. I know she's horny at that moment. Whenever I remember her life story, I immediately feel like I am her ""older brother"" and that's what stops me from thinking about having sex with her because I am really concerned for M. I was tired so I decided we should go home already. She slept throughout the way. After an hour, we arrived at my place.

We're both inside my room. She brushed her teeth and I took a shower after. I dried my hair, did my skincare routine, and applied my night perfume. She asked if she could borrow any shirt so I handed her one. She quickly undressed her top and I got really nervous so I turned my back and pretend to look for a music on my computer. She told me ""It's fine, you can look."" I didn't. She looked disappointed. I lay on the bed and she immediately went there too. I was really exhausted and I don't really have any sexual plans with her that night. I told her ""let's sleep. Good night."" She replied ""ang bango bango mo naman"" and kissed me on my cheek. She continued kissing me there for a minute. Then she kissed my mouth. She fucking choked me, my god, I got horny. I kissed her back. We kissed for around 15 min. I told her I got no problem with us just kissing.  She then tried to undress me. I said No. She grabbed my hand and placed it on her chest. It was big and really soft. But I told her I don't want it. She got mad. She told me ""I am offering you my body, why don't you want it?"" followed by ""Why do you respect me so much?! Pwede bang bastusin mo ko kahit ngayong gabi lang?!"" Don't get me wrong, I am really horny during that time. She's really hot and cute but given her situation, I really felt like I wanna be her friend and not her lover. I told her that I don't want to and will not have sex with her. It's our first day of meeting each other and we only talked for less than a week. How could she trust me that quickly?

I asked her, ""Why are you so eager to have sex with me?""She told me ""because it's a form of validation. I'll feel validated.""I told her ""sex does not mean validation.""

She burst into tears. She told me it was her first time receiving that kind of respect because all through her life, she was abused and disrespected by the people around her. Strangers judging her looks. Men catcalling her, and exes who didn't even bother to treat her right. They really treated her with less than the bare minimum and that made me her first date because they didn't even go outside for a date, not even once. She continued crying as if she was slapped by reality.  I realized during that time, she was considering her body and herself as a tool that's why she wanted to have sex so badly. It made me sad. I comforted her for at least an hour. She thanked me again and again because finally, she realized her worth. I told her she was very strong, smart, and amazing coz even though she had a shitty life like that, she's still fighting. I'm proud of her.

Sadly, I want her to fix herself first. And she knows that she needs to fix it too. I told her I don't want to continue our relationship and be better off as friends only. I've mentioned she can contact me anytime if she needs anything and I'll be willing to help her if I can. The next day, I drove her home. hugged her for the last time, and let her have my shirt as a gift. It was a bittersweet moment.

There's my first-ever bumble story. The end.

To M, I hope you are doing well. I know you'll succeed. I saw your courage and passion. I believe you'll become the lawyer you always aspire to be. Good luck M. I don't even know if I'll continue using bumble. Who knows what the fuck will happen to me next. But to be honest, I am still looking for the right one.

Fuck fest with the best girl PT 1,"The two of us live on both ends of the Philippines and we have decided to meet in the middle, so somewhere in Visayas. We have met a few times before but only for the night and all those nights, we literally fucked until sunrise. Intro about my sub, she is one of the warmest person you'll ever meet if you ever get the luxury to do so. But only I have the privilege to see her other side. The side where she wants to be used and abused. 

The side where she WANTS to spend the entire 3 day vacation locked up inside our hotel room and naked the entire time just waiting for me to play with her fuck holes. The best part about the two of us is that our kinks are 1:1, making the use of safe words non existent for us. 

She arrive a bit earlier than me for our first day, so she is the one who checked in our hotel room while I arrived a bit past dinner time and had to make some stop over to grab a few things, but the moment I got into the elevator heading up to our room. My heart was racing and my cock was already throbbing because we hadn't seen each other for a couple of months at this point. 

When I opened the door to our room, I found just the most amazing sight I've ever laid my eyes on. There she was in the middle of that empty room, kneeling down on the floor waiting for me. Wearing nothing but an apron and collar attached to a chain. As I walked towards her, no words were said between the two of us. She handed me the the chains to her collar and proceeded to drop my pants down, wrapping her arms around me and immediately swallowed my cock from tip to base.From that point on, it was nothing but a haze of just the two of us sharing bodily fluids and me playing with her mouth, pussy and ass. We even got a dildo that can be attached to my cock so that I'd get to fuck both her holes at the same time. 

It was a sight to behold for me to see her entire face so full and covered in spit that it's all dripping down to her hair while getting both her holes stuffed. (Playing with our spit is one of our favorite kinks btw) In between fucking I'd pull out and start feasting on both her asshole and pussy using my mouth and to hear her moan as her cream oozes down in my mouth while her hips are shaking like a proper fuck toy is nothing short of a heavenly experience.Being a good sub, her rewards is that she gets to sit on my face with the condition that she plays with her tongue and mouth and let her spit drip down to my as I stick my tongue inside her fuck holes. 

My deal with her is that she doesn't get to waste any of my cum. It's either she swallows it, or I blow my load inside her ass. Since I was able to train her to be a proper anal whore, she would always prefer to have my load in her asshole. After that first round, I pulled out and and admired her gaping ass while all the cum I've saved for about a week starts to flow out of her beautiful and used up hole. 

Our first encounter lasted for three and a half hours, and we ended it with me dragging her by the leash towards the shower room. She knelt down in front of me with a smile on her she held my cock as I pee all over her face and body.",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/14go81v/fuck_fest_with_the_best_girl_pt_1/,t2_dpy3etah8,2023-06-23 12:00:10,21,4
(secretly) Manyaman 4.,"We were still on the bed. She wanted me lying on the bed and her on top. I removed her pants and she removed my shirt. 
She held my dick with two hands putting her mouth on it again-- This time walang sabit, it was smoother-- her sucking now on point, but still can't take it full.

'Thats a good girl, mas masarap yan baby..'

Still focused on sucking me with pride, playfully teasing with her tongue. 

She sucked my balls habang jinajakol niya ako ng dalawang kamay then licked from shaft to tip, sucking it back as much as her mouth and throat that can take. 

'Do you like sucking dick baby?' 

I teased her softly.

'I like sucking YOUR dick daddy..' 

I got turned on so much I held her hair and fucked her face deep with gigil, her small mouth salivating while gawking. Her eyes teary, mascara running down her cheeks and her mouth salivating like a wild dog in heat. She was a beautiful mess. 

I pulled her up and laid her down on the bed to switch, for her to rest (lie) and catch her breath.(another lie). I put my right hand under to support her neck while kissing her softly again. 

My left hand ran from her neck to fondling her breasts, my finger tracing slowly looking for her nipples outside her bra. 

'mhhmm..'

Her moans always in surprise pleasure and her body quivers at every pressure point I find. Her body was responsive, foreign to being touched and devoured bit by bit. The body of a woman is Wunderland, finding its pleasure is the key to life. Breaking her in for me was kinky enough, pero iba ang sarap pag nakahanap ka ng kapwa mo malibog. It keeps giving and cumming. 

She moved her bra up as I ran my tongue on her breasts heading slowly to her nipples and gave it a slow circular lick warming it up, I sandwich it in between my lips and applied pressure. 

'mmmmmm...' 

Her soft moans as long as my lips was nibbling her tits. 

Her hand reached out for my dick stroking it slowly as a response.

I added more pressure with the tip of my tongue on her tits, still locked with my lips continuously licking and alternating pressure points. 

'ehmmmm.....' 

an octave higher -ala japanese, with more gigil. Her hand is just gripping my dick holding for dear life until I release her. I was so pleased.

My hand reached out straight inside her panties, my fingers grabbing her pussy. She was dripping wet. Her face flushed, with That look that she got caught, because she's naughty and did it.  

'Napakalibog mo baby..' 

She can only bite her lip as a response as I easily slipped a finger in.

'ahhh..' 

'You're so wet baby, mukhang nag eenjoy ka ah..' 

I inserted Two fingers cycling in, looking for something.

'ahhmmmmm'

Her hips started moving, wanting to match the rhythm of my fingers desperately. 

Nag lilikot at di na siya mapapakali and I wouldn't let her go easy-- my middle finger found her Gspot, with three fingers in. She lifted her back. She was done. Her first will be quick. but let's see how much she can cum for me. 

I licked my fingers and had her taste herself, she was sweet and salty.

I released my arm, and positioned myself to eat. I fully remove her panties and stare at her wetness. I wanted more. I wanted her whole. It's rare to find a treat that turns you on with personality and submits to be used and abused ng kalibugan. 

I planted soft kisses behind her legs and trailed my tongue slowly to her shaved pussy, parted her lips with two fingers revealing her clit. I gave it a good sniff and licked it like ice cream... slow pressure applied, ending with a tongue flick.

'ahhmm..' 

She gasped trying to place herself. her legs locking my head in. I wouldn't allow it. 

Hinawi' ko yung legs niya, opening her slowly -- my tongue still on her clit signing the letters to complete my name. Hearing her moans as confirmation and her juices as my receipt.

She was a pleasure feast, and it was a sin I wouldn't shy away from me to fill.

Para sa’yo na nanghihinayang sa haba ng pinagsamahan nyo..,"Kung pakiramdam mo ayaw mo na, timbangin mo rin kung bakit nga ba nagstay ka pa.
Bigyan mo nang pagkakataon na tantusin hindi lang yung pangit, kundi pati yung maganda.
Tandaan mo, minsan may punto sa iyong buhay na siguradong-sigurado ka na minamahal mo sya.
Wag mo na syang tawagin ng kung anu-anong pangalan—bantay, chaperone, o kaya gwardiya.
Gusto mo lang nmn kasi ijustify sa utak mo yung pag-aakala mo na nakakulong ka.

At kung nakakulong ka man, hindi dahil kinulong ka nya.
Pagdaka’y tingnan mo, matagal nang bukas ang selda mo, at ikaw lang ang mismong pumipiling magkulong ng sarili mo sa kanya.

Stop counting those years in your life, instead start counting the life in those years.
At kung mas matimbang parin yung pag-ibig mo sa kanya, eh di martir ka, este, sige bigyan mo pa kahit isa pang tyansa, basta ipangako mo sa sarili mo na totoong ito’y huli na.
At kung mas matimbang yung mas makakabuti yung hiwalayan mo sya, then get real, a storm with the right person is more bearable than a paradise with the wrong one.

GF Plays With Herself But Forgets How Much I Need Her,"WARNING: LONG POST AHEAD

TW: Abuse/Rape, Blackmail, Deprivation

This is by far my second post in all of Reddit, so it's kind of a milestone for me, I guess...

But my situation is not a milestone but a living nightmare.

Allow me to tell you my story from the very beginning in Taglish:

I (26M) met ""Yor"" (24F) in 2017 sa isang computer shop dito sa amin sa Pampanga. She was still with her last ex back then, at kakapasok lang niya ulit ng school after giving birth to her unica hija from an earlier ex. Just for context, parehong abusive ang exes niya, tapos blackmailer pa itong huli (and they almost had twins kung hindi nakunan itong naging partner ko).

Long story short, dahil pareho kaming tambay sa iisang computer shop, we first became good friends until she was complaining about breast milk (kasi hindi pa niya alam na buntis pala siya after nilang mag-away at maghiwalay ng last ex niya). I joked, ""Sayang naman. Inumin ko na lang straight from the source."" To which she teased back, ""\[Gawin mo\] dito.""

After a month of subtle flirting, she took my virginity in January 2020, and I asked her to be my FWB. She didn't hesitate; hatid sundo ko siya sa university, at sustentado ko rin siya ng pills. Save for her red days and weekends, let's just say I bred her over and over and over and over. After all, I'm a male; I evolved as a seed dispenser. Siya naman, she was fresh from a breakup.

Lockdown happened. Obviously, walang action, puro flirting and teasing lang sa Messenger. Nagkita kami ulit August 2020, but still nothing sexual. We eventually became an official couple December of that year, but it wasn't until May of the following year na may nangyari ulit sa'min.

She wasn't on the pill, so I had to wear a condom, pero siya mismo nagtanggal on the condition that I should pull out. After that, nagsimula na ulit akong bilhan siya ng pills, but then she began doing the Yuzpe method instead simula noong September 2021. I had no idea what side effect that thing had, only that her period was getting more and more delayed by December.

Then came January of this year. That was the last time we ever had sex. At first, hindi ko pa gaanong pansin kasi ang usapan namin ever since is that she is the one to plan and schedule our deed. I did that out of what I thought was psychotherapy of giving her back control over her body and herself, not to mention na obviously mas experienced siya sa akin when it comes to sex. Pero nagsimula na akong makahalata 'nung nagalit siya sa'kin for having less effort than usual for our March month-sary.

Simple lang ang sinabi ko kasi ano'ng petsa na, ""Baka nakakalimutan mong may dapat tayong gawin pero hinihintay lang kita."" Natigilan siya sa paghuhuramentado that time kasi never niya akong nakitang nagalit, tapos poker face pa ang pagkakasabi ko nito sa kanya. She knew that I was dead serious, and that I wasn't in the mood for petty couple fights.

Right at that moment, doon ko rin narealize na the reason as to why I was beginning to grow colder and colder sa maraming mga bagay is because I haven't been flooded with oxytocin, y'know, after sex. Sure, pwede naman daw magkamay, they say. But I suffer from DE: delayed ejaculation. Hirap akong magmaintain ng erection kahit healthy naman ako generally, tapos next to impossible akong labasan. And from my own experience, the more na nagsasarili lang ako, with or without a toy, the more na lumalala lang ang condition ko.

But ever since we've been doing it, napansin kong significant ang improvement sa condition ko: I was almost as good as normal. When we resumed May 2021 some 14 months after we last had it, the more na tama ang suspicion ko na I need actual sex, and that masturbation only makes matters worse for me.

However, that's exactly the problem: ayaw na niya akong pagbigyan since January. Her inconsistent reasoning: que sio ayaw daw niya mabuntis ulit kasi baka ano na naman daw sasabihin sa kanya na mga masasakit na salita sa kanila, que sio gusto naman daw talaga niya akong pagbigyan pero gusto daw muna niya ng ""normal bf/gf"" na walang sex involved, at que sio hindi rin daw niya maintindihan ang sarili niya kung bakit wala na siya sa mood for sex (even though I did everything to get her worked up and she knows it, too).

I gotta be honest: the temptation to cheat is there, and so are the willing friends who want to volunteer in getting me off, PERO hindi ako ganung klase ng tao. BUT the worse part was that she casually admitted to being too busy at work that she forgot it was our month-sary just this previous month AND that she calmly confessed that she masturbated five times inside the comfort room at her workplace WHILE I needed her since January. And truth be told, pinipigilan kong maluha while typing all of this kada naaalala ko 'yun, kasi ito mismo ang last naming pinag-awayan.

Ayokong makipagbreak dahil pareho naming hindi kakayanin after all that we've been through as a loving couple, but she is being deliberately insensitive to my needs for quite some time now. I don't know, too, kung tama ba na sisihin ko ang Yuzpe method sa hormonal imbalance na cause ng lack of sexual desire niya.

P.S.: Please pray to Whomever you believe for my healing, kasi I'm tired of fighting off another episode of depression sa nangyayari sa'min ng partner ko.",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/wx6cyi/gf_plays_with_herself_but_forgets_how_much_i_need/,t2_f7x5i1mh,2022-08-25 14:09:13,18,37

""omg, are you whistling Trampoline by SHAED?""

This caught me by surprise, as I was just minding my own business, when this girl jumped out from behind my office monitor, with eyes wide enough you think she was staring at your soul.

Meet Julie (not her real name) my best friend since 2018

I never saw her as a ""woman"", in ways that I don't think sexually of her. She was, however, my safe space, my ""tangina, mahal ko pa siya"" person. (She also is aware of the entire Jane fiasco that you can read [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/1943ff2/little_did_i_know/)) That moment she heard me whistling Trampoline, we immediately clicked and became each other's go-to person ever since.

Now for context, Julie's your typical cutie / maputing chinita. Standing 5'2"", she had the attitude of a 6'footed person. She took no bullshit, and procrastinated to no end, with sassy remarks to end every complaint. We talked about so many things, like our favorite sex positions, our ""body counts"" and more, but everything was platonic and wholesome I never once questioned or wondered what she looked like naked. We just never poked fun at each other that way. Possible reason? maybe it's because she had a boyfriend of 8 years HAHAHAHAHA

One day, Julie messaged me on our work chat

""Beb, I need you. Something happened. Meet me sa locker pls.""

*Fuck. She must've spilled her frappe again and wants an extra shirt.*

Exhaling a deep sigh, I logged out for the day. Thinking about how she's probably taking advantage of me always having an extra shirt in my locker for her clumsiness. Whatever, anything for a homie, right?

Her locker was on a different floor, so after picking up my extra shirt, I took the elevator going up to where Julie's locker is. It was almost robotic how that trip from my computer desk to Julie's locker was, My mind was just aloof, not thinking about anything in particular.

So, as you'd expect, what I saw before my eyes caught me off guard.

*Julie has a black eye and a huge bruise on her neck.*

It took me awhile to process what I was looking at. At first I thought this was her classic clumsy maneuver to work, since agreeably, our office stairs are really slippery. I think it was a full minute before it registered what had happened to her face.

""Bakit ka may dalang shirt? Beb nadapa lang ako-""

""Tangina mo, I'm not stupid"" I said. I could see her eyes start to glimmer, but before she could burst into tears, I said ""clumsy mo kasi, ganda ka lang talaga e no?"" tears started to well up from her face, then her teeth started to show, flashing me a half smiling, half crying Julie. I placed my free arm around her shoulder, and gave her a good half hug. ""Tara hatid na kita sa clinic.""

Our friendship just grew from here. She witnessed the rise and fall of my relationships, the ""one night stands"" in betweens and my ""once in a lifetime"" chance at having a threesome (a story for another time).

In turn, I witnessed her growth too. Whenever her dick of a boyfriend comes home (OFW kasi), and when he's gone, and Julie would have this curiosity for women. Now I don't support cheating in any form, but she had a fuck buddy at one point. I know it was wrong, but I'd rather see her happy with that side dick than be physically abused by her boyfriend.

Then 2020 came, and she got covid. multiple times. in fact, we joked around how much of a ""masamang damo"" she is, because she got every variant and came out of each one strong and fighting and bitchy as ever before.

I was working in a different company by then, thankfully was WFH. I videocalled her everyday, making sure she's okay. ""aww, you're still alive."" was how I would always start our 5 hour long daily video calls.

Her last day of quarantine, I sent her her favorite Absolut Kurant, and we had an online inuman session.

By this time, I practically have seen her in her most comfortable state, her relaxed state. On this particular night, she was wearing a long oversized shirt, and no bra.

""Beb, I have to tell you something"" she said, on our 6th shot for the night.

""mm? I know, I know fuck Jane, I meant noth-""

""Ano ba puro ka na lang Jane daig mo pa ung may jowa e, this is my kwento, ok? shut up."" she said, then we started laughing and I got silent, waiting for what she had to say next.

""I think he's cheating on me sa Europe.""

I was silent, but I could tell she was waiting for my response.

""bakit kasi ayaw mo pa hiwalayan, mukhang malabo na rin naman ung green card mo.""

she was quiet. \*oh no, quick shot na bago pa umiyak. ""\*hey wait lang shot mo na. daya mo.""

She laughed, and took her shot, gulping the fiery liquid down her throat and exclaiming ""haaah putangina ang hirap ng may kipay"" I laughed.

Everything was right in the world that night. I was comfortable in my apartment, having recently bought an ergo chair, leaning back and watching my best friend give me that look she gives her potential ""victims"".

What she said next changed our relationship forever.

A core memory,"I met this guy maybe 2018 or 2019. He was my first ever walk experience. One night I was just bored and dahil uso dati sa whisper yung mga walker posts tinry ko lang din just for fun. And he's from nearby lang din and he was just bored that weekend lang din so we decided to meet.

It's been awhile so medyo blurry na yung details. Pero all I can remember was the feeling. Grabeng sarap, used and abused ako nun. Gamit na gamit talaga. He made me ride him till I couldn't anymore kasi hinang hina na ko. Tapos he ate me till I came over and over hanggang basang basa na yung bed, tapos finingger ako hanggang mag squirt ako. All the while smiling and just enjoying seeing me going crazy from cumming over and over. Playing with my body and pussy like a toy that he owns. Making me lick my own juices from his fingers.

Mga almost 3 hours yun and he didn't cum kahit nung finufuck niya ko, kasi pinipigilan niya. Nung ready na siya mag cum suko na talaga ako haha sobrang sakit at ngawit na. Pero he still enjoyed it naman daw and of course I enjoyed it. Kaya tinuloy tuloy ko that time yung walking phase ko na natigil lang because of the pandemic.

Anyway, after nga nun medyo nagka-crush ako sa kanya cos the after sex conversation was cool din. But he had to leave cos his work was based abroad. But after a year we got in touch again and was able to go out na hindi walk. I liked him and I thought he liked me too. But apparently he's going through something, and was crazy for some girl, and he lied about some things and I just felt used and betrayed. So I hated him after that.

Now the other day out of boredom I installed tinder just for fun, I unsinstalled din agad. But we matched and started talking again. And niyaya ako ng FWB or hookup. Good girl na ko ngayon. Over na ko sa hoe phase ko and I haven't hooked up in awhile. Pero because of that tigang na tigang na rin ako haha.

Medyo tempting patulan yung offer pero masisira yung promise ko sa sarili ko na hindi na makipag-hookup ulit. Pero he was really good in bed so I know mae-enjoy ko rin naman.

Sorta one more thing, I did go on one date with a guy two weeks ago and okay naman. We're supposed to go on a date soon din. Idk if he likes me enough. And if that should stop me from seeing someone else.",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/ue8g7j/a_core_memory/,t2_3p20l7cr,2022-04-29 07:38:47,9,4
"ate is 2 down, 5 more to go, folks","Disclaimer! :> By no means did I intend to promote substance USE or ABUSE, just wanna share my experience.

TLDR: 2 down, but not sure if I’ll push with 5 more to go.

I was supposed to meet only 1 yesterday but the second guy was so near (so near, it’s risky haha) that I just winged it. I gave him 2 hours, he gave me a creampie and a mouthful. :> He was the kisser type and was good at building momentum. Hindi rush which makes him a star in my eyes. Foreplay, baby. I kept saying ‘diserv ko to, diserv’ as he fucked me doggy-style. I managed to record (with his permission) audio of when I was rimming him. (I’ll post it!) I still have to apologize to his Stitch stuffed toy though for the scene it had to see. It was a sweet quickie. 

He gave me (more like I harbored) a b&w graduation photo with a sign on the back as a keepsake. It kinda looks like an ‘in memory of’ picture kasi b&w. HAHAHA T’was cute though. If you see this, thank you!
 
I was fucking stoned pauwi. I stop by sa kainan to have soup and sisig. Maulan pa so it was perfect. 

The moral of the story is huwag niyo po ako tularan. HAHAHA

As for the 5, I’m contemplating. Retiring na ba? HAHAHA I’m trying to win no nut November, eh. I’ll get tests this 30th too.

Can’t get this off my head,"My gf broke up with me last year this December after a fight with her abusive family…she told me that she couldn’t handle it anymore, but then she’ll tell me na she was already losing feelings, then the next day she’ll tell me that she was protecting me from her parents…and so on…

She wanted to stay friends and we hung out January and February, the last time we hung out, we ate and went to a karaoke…she wanted to cling to my arm and hold my hand while walking..
On the way home she asked me if it’s okay that we’re just friends, I said yes

For me, even if friends nalang, Basta nakakausap and nakikita ko sya, okay na sakin 

But at this time hindi parin clear sakin kung bakit sya nakipagbreak, I was there before, while, and after we broke up, I would always try to comfort her and talk to her….

But then today, I saw her story.

It was her and another guy, kissing her hand.

I know I should’ve moved on, I shouldn’t have kept hoping. I don’t know what to feel.

I replied to the story saying congrats and asking her how long have they been together and where did they meet?

She said her thanks but seemed cold and told me not to ask too many questions

I said sorry

But I can’t understand how she would move on so quick?? After her numerous reasons to break up? Was she being honest with her reasons? I kept asking myself that because she never answered them.

Now I keep imagining scenarios, things me and my ex would do, places we would go…how we would have sex almost weekly……now the image of her getting fucked by another man is all over my head…… her doing things that she used to do with me…..i tried my hardest for us to stay together, but her parents just always ruin things, now she’s really gone. For good. The only thing stuck in my head is her with that guy on the bed, having sex….I wanna get it out….I really wanna get over her…

She was my first gf.",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/12z4vmc/cant_get_this_off_my_head/,t2_qbkuzc7c,2023-04-26 11:21:21,2,11
What are your top 3 favorite sex positions?,"Aside from the missionary position (which is a classic), what else are your go-to sex positions that hit the right spots every time you do it?;) I have quite a few depending on whether we’re into rough, degrading sex or rough, passionate/intimate sex (always rough!;))

Mine are (in no particular order or preference): 

-Prone bone (with my legs crossed)

How we do it: I’d lie face down on the bed, legs crossed. I’d arch my ass up just a little bit so my guy can enter me from behind. Once he’s inside me, I’d flatten my arched ass and he may either rest on his elbows or completely press his body against mine (my personal preference). I would occasionally turn my head sideways for some deep kisses while he fucks me ever so gently at first which would eventually progress to deeper and harder thrusts. 

Why it’s a favorite: it’s a lazy fuck but it feels oh so amazing! It hits the right spots and I like how intimate it feels, how our bodies are rubbing against each other. I especially love it when he leans in for some deep kisses, how he sucks my lower lip while he’s thrusting and groaning.

-Spooning (another lazy fuck position)

How we do it: We usually start it out with me on all fours (like how you do a doggy fuck), he enters me from behind then we lie down sideways; my upper leg (usually left leg) crossed over the leg underneath, both  legs relaxed on the bed. My head usually resting on his arm (most of the time his right arm) while we hold hands. His other hand caressing my body, arm grabbing me closer to him or groping my breasts. My other hand is grabbing his fine ass or gigil grabbing whatever I can. He’d sometimes kiss my nape or my back. I’d occasionally turn my head towards him to make out  while we gyrate our hips in rhythm. 

Why it’s a favorite: another lazy, intimate fucking that hits the right spots as both of us move in rhythm, bodies in full contact with each other. I think this position also hits my g-spot the best, there’s a unique pleasurable sensation that I don’t really feel in other positions. Could be how his dick is angled too that’s why it really rubs the ridges a few centimeters in, inside my pussy (not sure what it’s called, basta that part inside, near the urethra).  

-the classic doggy style fucking

How we do it: me on all fours (supported by knees and arms or knees and elbows; or sometimes ass up, on my knees with my head, shoulders and chest on the bed) usually at the edge of the bed, him standing, aggressively fucking me from behind. He would sometimes put one of his leg up on the bed while thrusting. When he does that, I could feel his balls slapping against my labia, which by the way, feels really good. Since I like it a lot when he dominates me, he’d usually give me some good ass spanking during doggy fuck. When he’s gigil, he would grab my waist and pull me into him with each thrust or grab my shoulders to pull me in. There were several instances that I was left with light bruises near my collar bone and I kinda like that too.

Why I like it: I love this position a lot when I need him to use and abuse me like a fuck toy. I feel so vulnerable and exposed and the sensations are so amazing. He also gets a good view of my ass. I rarely cum during penetration and those rare times would usually be during intense and rough doggy style fucking. 

The classic missionary will always be a favorite but since it’s a given, i didn’t include it in my special list anymore. Easy access for making out while he thrusts and I can grab onto his muscular arms and wide chest. Fingers clawing their way sometimes because of gigil. It is quite notable that whenever he fucks me in this position, he has a certain rhythm that feels really good and I like it when my legs are high up on his shoulders, a bit spread apart and I feel his balls lightly slapping my perineum in each thrust. Feels fucking amazing.

How do I enlighten him?,"**Umpisahan natin dito sa aking background:**

While on a relationship sa bf ko may mga nakakameet and fuck na din ako. I already admitted it to him. In short, ang hoe phase ko ay never natapos simula college pa. 

***Sooo....***

Mid 2021 when my bf and I decided to take our relationship on another level. We are on a long term relationship na. It was just at first na habang nagsesex is we were discussing the possibilities na what if someone is watching or there are lots of guys fucking me and sobrang arouse ako doon. Then one day after having sex is naitanong ko kung seryoso ba kami doon or we were just talking about it because para maboost ang sex? Hindi naman kami naglolokohan so we agreed to find a unicorn. Then one day he introduced me his old friend which is for me okay naman because we vibe. 

Come 2023 early this year we are so desperate to find a uni kasi ayaw nya ng mfm na kasali sya. Madami rin sya nakakausap from here pero ang hindi lang maganda sa akin is the involvement of the substance abuse sa part ng girls from here. So it automatically turns me off na nakikipag usap sya sa ganon. He/we met some girls naman that are clean. 

***Madalas warning ng friend ko: Kaya na ba ng puso at damdamin mo?***

For me there should not be any feelings involved. I don't know why yung sa nakaka chat and meet nya is gusto nya i-take to another level. Sa ganito naman kasi wala dapat feelings involve, na it will be just pure fuck and fun. Pero eto may nakakausap sya ngayon and he asked the girl if she wanted it to take it to another level. I'm getting mad and confused kasi hindi dapat umabot sa ganon. I honestly feel jelous sometimes and okay lang naman na they fuck, but not on the same room kung nasaan din ako. Hindi keri ng palpitation ng puso ko. Im getting confused kung bakit ganon....",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/13r60th/how_do_i_enlighten_him/,t2_bzr4x5xz5,2023-05-25 10:57:56,3,5
I almost forgot he was taken.,"**He was taken.** 

Magkaibigan kami for several years already, and I knew he is taken. Medyo iba yung closeness na meron kami compared sa ibang circle namin. He would buy me breakfast or lunch and just treats me better than the rest. He even offers na ihatid ako after classes Later he confessed he was having feelings for me. I told him I'm not gonna be ""the other girl"" sa relationship so I just told him to stay away from me.

One day, we were making a requirement (we were in grad school na nito and he started all those treatment nung college pa lang kami) so ayun, we kind of had to go to his place to finalize our paper. Pag pasok ko walang tao and instantly naka feel ako ng tension. Hindi ko pinansin and just focused on the paper we were making. Shortly, tumabi na siya sakin (nasa sala kami) and he also worked on the paper. 

After a while, lumapit siya sakin to ask something. So we were discussing things na tinanong niya and one second after that we were kissing na. Like torrid passionate kissing. We were giggling and kissing at the same time. I was touching his chest and he was caressing my boobs. He was moving towards me para pahigain ako when suddenly may bumusina sa labas ng bahay nila. Dun ako natauhan. Inayos ko sarili ko at bumalik sa pagkakaupo. He went out to open the gate and ate niya pala yung dumating. I greeted his sister na kilala ko rin since university days so I don't think magdududa siya sa ginagawa namin dun. LOL. 

After a few minutes, di ko na kinaya yung tension. Nagpaalam na ako umuwi and grabbed my keys and drove home. 

I touched myself to the thought na we were doing that. Sayang may dumating. 

He asked me kung pagbibigyan ko siya if ever he leaves his girlfriend. Btw, he was with a verbally and physically abusive woman. However, I told him if you wanna get out of that relationship, do it. Don't make me a reason.

kantutin mo ako,"By no means did I intend to promote substance USE or ABUSE, just wanna share my experience :0

I met this cute babe, he was older but youthful. Tite for days. :> Kwela pa so we vibe. He claimed to be a sub which was 1/2 lang pala. I’ll only share what I remember. We tried edibs. Hehe

So kaya ko naman siya is deep throat, although kailangan effort kasi quite packing si kuya. The exciting part is when I gave him a rimjob.. then  when we were trying to figure out saan ang prostate niya, and trying to get him cum in my mouth. (Newsflash: He never did) Ang galaw TT He was squirming and moaning. I tell you, I think I came just from watching. He was extra sensitive sa glan, so handjob malala plus fingering combo. He was a fucking sight to see. May cute noises pa so kinikilig ako while watching him squirm. I think the whole hand/finger thing ended when he got overstimulated. Kaya niya ang 2 fingers sa ass TT, ako hindi. He also said “kantutin mo ako,” TT nakakabaliw ang power play.

Nung tinamaan na ako, ramdam ang every fucking stimuli. He gave me a lot of hickeys so medj doubtful ako kung sub ba to. He fucked me doggy and missionary. Pero di ko na talaga tanda. What I remember tho is ang bilis niya tayuan. :> Konting kiss lang ipapasok na ulit. Ang sarap kasi so medj matagal ako ma satiate kagabi. Human dildo vibes, tinamad na ako at may tama pa haha

The drive was short but it was bliss. it was nostalgic, like driving in the neighborhood (after) class when I was younger. This time M still driving like a boss and I was her date on the passenger seat on the way to our bnb. 

'This is cute, being a passenger prince is great'. My thoughts streamed through and my mouth followed. We were both chill, she was driving and I was the stuck up.

'Hmm...' 

She gave a short smirk, Her left hand shifting the back of head to rest, right hand to the steering wheel. being proud of herself.

'Mas maangas ka pa sakin e, gusto kitang kagatin'. 

She just bit her lower lip still smiling.

'Have you listened to this..?'

A Kendrick Lamar piece was on queue. 

'Not really, but she's smooth...' 

I was staring at her smiling, sizing her up close, licking her parts with my eyes. 

'I was imagining the things I'd do to you and I can't wait.'
 
She gave me a quick glance, looked at me like she wanted a bite off of me too.
She shifted hands, left to the steering wheel and rested her right hand on top of the hand rest between our seats. 

I put my left hand on top of hers. 

'I'm sorry my hands are cold..' 
she said softly. 

'Don't worry baby, I'll warm you up..' 

I held her hand lightly, moved to my chest and I planted a soft warm kiss at the back of her hand, warming it up. 

'Good girl'.

Our BnB was spacious, a bedroom, a sala, dual kitchen space, a single bathroom and shared parking space. It was more than we needed and more than enough given the late booking. 

We settled our bags. She went to the bathroom and I went to the couch locking the door behind me.

I was seated at the couch when she came out. As she was removing her shirt, walking towards me with intent, She's wearing a black sports bra fit for her size, but I could see clearly that she's above average for a Pinay.

Her face was innocently cute, but her eyes, hungry and wanting, turned me on instantly, my dick pulsed in excitement. 

'Come here baby..'

I held out my hand but she sat on me kneeling, her face looking up mine, eyes wanting.. a sweet babygirl in need.

I gave her a soft kiss on her lower lip nibbling while we're still lost in each other's eyes. She was warm and more relaxed now as we filled the room with make out moans. I motioned her to the floor, she knelt in between my legs this time, and my hands cupped her cute small face. 

I peeled back from her lips, foreheads together still locked with each other's eyes, it was sweet and sensual, her brown eyes drowning in mine still leering from our passionate kiss and tongue.

'Nakakagigil ka baby..' 

I kissed her again, this time mapusok -- My right hand at her nape, my left hand on her neck, thumb on her cheek, three fingers on the other cheek with my pinky below her jaw and squeezed her small mouth slightly open.  

Her eyes were excited, her smile evident even with my hands holding half of her lower face.

I pulled her face towards mine, I kissed her open mouth thrusting my tongue looking for hers. Her tongue was playful, saliva sweet and I replaced it with mine. She was a treat to make out with--submissive but knows how to tease you back. Lumalaban sa laplapan. 

'Id like to fuck your mouth now baby..' 

she just nodded like a cute good girl. 

I pushed her hands back, removing my pants hastily. 

'Relax ka lang baby, stay put..' 
I eyed her tumbler at the side for her to drink water and she obliged. 

I removed my pants but left my boxers. She was side eyeing the length of my boner while drinking, curious and excited. 

'Come on baby, suck me and make Daddy happy’

I leaned back and watched her reach my boner with both hands. She was smiling while biting her lower lip feeling how hard I was. I pulled down my boxers for her surprise. 

Her eyes widened, mouth open -- I grabbed her hair, guided her head and shoved as much dick in her small face and cute mouth. 

'Asan ang angas mo ngayon babygirl?' 

I looked at her eyes in full submission-- mildly choking with half my dick in, fucking her mouth slowly. 

'I told You, look very pretty with my dick in your mouth..'

'mmmhh..' 

Her eyes still in bliss, but her brain was empty - there was nobody home. she came vanilla, and I will finish her used and abused as discussed. 

We had to move to the bedroom after a few minutes of her sucking. I don't have a straight tool and she was wearing braces. I had her lie on the bed on her side to deepthroat her properly. Facefucking her was fair, I was helping her adjust to my length, she'll get used to it in a few sessions -- or so I thought.",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/198w9m1/secretly_manyaman_3/,t2_v8fvzwsh,2024-01-17 21:14:08,5,1
Wala na kami ng paborito kong tite :(,"1 year na akong walang dilig kaya naiinggit ako sa mga nababasa ko dito sa AJ hahaha. Nakakamiss man but I broke up with him na last month. A little throwback. We started doing the deed nung 2020, pandemic kasi and we started seeing each other often. We were high school sweethearts, nag-break kasi he cheated but nagkabalikan after 4 years.
I was his first but may experience na ako (I was abused by my former bf but this is another story). Kaya I taught him things nung first time namin, from kisses to bjs. We rented a room and ang bilis nya matapos maybe because first time nya nga. Tapos nangulit na sya kaya nasundan yun. Since we were jobless that time, we would go by a nearby beach and magsi-set up na kami ng tent, and he would fuck me there. Sobra ang thrill and excitement kasi may mga dumadaang tao. Pero alam ko aware naman sila since sino ba namang maglalagay ng saradong tent ng alas tres ng hapon hahaha. Ganun pa rin yung nangyayari, he would finish at 20 minutes. Hindi nga man lang ako nilabasan pero okay lang sa akin. Mahal ko eh hahaha.

And then we had the opportunity to go to Manila. First thing we did was book a hotel. Pagpasok palang, wala nang foreplay foreplay, diretso laplapan agad. I pushed him on the bed and I licked his ears down to his neck, to his nipple. He's a big guy kaya he has a dad bod. I like sucking and licking his nipples. But sa lahat lahat, gustong gusto ko na bini-BJ sya. His moans are music to my ears. I didn't care how sloppy and messy the BJ was. Lalo akong ginaganahan kapag napapamura sya and sinasabihan ako na ang sarap sarap ko raw sumubo. His dick has a certain smell na nakaadik. Hindi ko sya ma-describe hahaha pero I like smelling my hands pagkatapos ko syang i-BJ. Nalilibugan ako agad kapag naaamoy ko yun. 
Pero ang hindi ko malilimutan is one time after nyang labasan, we rested for a bit and nag-cr ako for a pee break kasi I was expecting na he would make me cum this time. Paglabas ko ng cr, kaloka si gago nakabihis na sya and nagsisintas na. I was looking forward for the cuddle pero walang nangyari. He did not even bother na bihisan ako or what. Nagalit ako sa kanya after kase I felt na parang naging bayarang babae ako. Alam mo yun, kulang na lang hagisan nya ako ng pera and say something in the lines of, ""I'm done fucking you, bahala ka na dyan"" HAHAHAHA.

We would meet once a month to have sex. Sobrang busy ko kase sa work that time kahit weekend may workload ako. Bumawi naman sya kahit papaano. What really turns me on everytime is kapag binabayo nya ako at nakatitig lang sya sa akin while holding my waist. Nandun yung look na love and libog. God, I love that man. I know he loved me naman.
Last sex namin sobrang rough. Sa sobrang rough, sinabihan ko pa sya ng ""Ayaw ko ng daliri mo, gusto ko yang tite mo ipasok mo sa puke ko"" habang fini-finger nya ako hahaha. Ito na rin yung time na nagkakalabuan na kami. Ang ugali nya kasi kahit dati pa, he would not talk to me. Nanggo-ghost bigla. Kapag naga-away kami, ako pa magri-reach out at mangungulit sa kanya para ma-resolve yung problem namin. It would take weeks bago nya ako i-chat o kausapin. Wala namang reason para maging busy sya since nasa dorm lang naman sya, waiting for the call ng agency. Dumagdag pa na stressed ako sa work ko since patong-patong yung projects ko and hindi kami okay ng fam ko. Pero okay ang bond namin pag magkasama kami, sa chats lang talaga kami madalas naga-away.

Aminado naman ako na it was my mistake. Nagkagusto ako sa ka-officemate ko. Crush lang naman. Hindi ako sexually attracted sa guy. We never even talked and the only conversation we had was when I asked who he voted, tapos yung simpleng ayaan lang pag magkakasalubong sa pantry na, ""Kape tayo, Ma'am."" May ka-live in din si guy and gf nya yun for years na.
Nabasa kase ng ex ko na kausap ko yung visor ni guy (na ka-close ko naman) and inaasar ako doon sa guy and sinakyan ko yung biro. Simula nun, naging cold na sya sa akin.

Umalis sya ng bansa na hindi ko alam. Sinasabi nya rin sa akin na hindi sya maka-online dahil busy sya sa work at shitty ang sched ng shift nya. Hindi na nga rin daw sya nakakapag-post kaya hindi nya na rin daw ako macha-chat palagi. Naniwala ako kase kita ko naman timeline nya, halos months ago na yung post. One day, hindi talaga ako mapakali. I checked his IG and nakita ko na yung pinagseselosan ko dati, na dahilan din ng breakup namin before, is nila-like nya yung recent posts nung girl. Yun din yung time na sabi nya hindi sya online. Tapos I asked my friend na friend nya sa fb kung kelan ang last post ni ex. Confirmed, naka-hide lahat ng posts sa akin.
Then, nalaman ko na lang na nakauwi na sya ng Pinas. Hindi ko alam. I cried for weeks. Nung di ko na kayang itago na alam ko na lahat, in-email ko na sya na alam ko na lahat. Oo, email kase hindi nya pinapansin yung chat ko sa messenger at viber hahahaha.

Nakipag-break na ako a month ago. Deactivated lahat ng socials ko para di nya na ako ma-reach out. Sabi nya, doon daw sya nawalan ng gana sa nalaman nya na nagkagusto ako sa iba. In-explain ko naman sa kanya lahat. May times na iniisip ko na baka mali ako ng desisyon kase mabait naman sya, hindi nya lang talaga ako binibigyan ng atensyon kahit sobrang dami nyang time. Tsaka kahit hindi nya ako kina-cuddle after sex, hindi ko pa rin talaga malimutan the way he stares at me habang binabayo ako. Just the thought of it makes me horny. Yun yung pinaka nami-miss ko.

Alam kong di mo to mababasa pero if oo, kung magawi ka man sa Manila ulit, i-email mo lang ako if gusto mo ng closure sex.

EDIT: Kaloka thank you sa iilang comforting words sa DM pero please, this is not an invitation po. Hindi ako interested for now sa hookups, ons, being a thirdy and a fubu.

"Of Pervert Doctors, Bus Ride and Humiliation 💔","I came home from Tagum. I rode the bus again. I went back and forth to Tagum thrice today. It is a very very long day.  This is not a juicy story but a diatribe of sorts to men and women alike that being too close to another person with plans of being intimate or to cut the chase short, or that engaging into sexual activities should always be with consent. 

I was planning to write this after a few days but words are flowing from my mind and I think it is better to write this while it hasn't sank in and I still feel apathetic about it. 

I woke up at 5am. I had planned yesterday that I will report for work on a Saturday to make up for my sick leave and to anticipate my absence on Monday for I was invited for a final interview with the VP of the University I had applied to. It was supposed to be a normal day. I was able to tie some loose ends at my work since I am alone and there are no interruptions. Until a resident physician came, let me name her Dr. M. She was a resident physician under Family Medicine and she was my doctor before Dr. Hen came. She was my doctor after the Doctor whom I refuse to remember since January. 

She had concerns on her contract and we also had a small talk before she upped and left. It was a good one hour of arranging my pending work on my tray when another resident physician came. When I saw him came in, it took a lot from me not to utter profanities. He is also a resident physician under FaMed. He was once my doctor. 

When I saw him, flashbacks of what happened last January came rushing to me. 

Early part of January of this year, I started seeing our Wellness Nurse because symptoms of my leukemia had been more evident. She is Dianne and I have mentioned her on several of my posts since she became a very good friend since that time. That's the time also when she endorsed me to Dr. F. He was tall. I can say that he is handsome. Typical tall, dark and handsome. Dr. F is kind and he is a very attentive doctor. Whenever me and Mira goes to Dianne to take our lunch, he volunteers in joining us for lunch and there were several times when he would insist in taking us home. I don't know. I just have this feeling that I am only safe with him whenever we are in the hospital. But whenever I am left alone with him, I feel uncomfortable. He asks too many personal questions and I find it intrusive. He has this mannerism of slightly touching my hand or arms which I find unusual for someone who is a doctor. Yes, he is my doctor but I think he has no reason to be touchy outside of the hospital. He also has this habit of uttering innuendos of him admiring me for being a single parent and being an independent woman. I did not mind him and took it as his kind of a joke. 

January 17, me and Mira went home late for she had to finish the statutory remittances. When we are about to go out of the employees' exit, he stopped his car and told us that he will take us home. Mira was at the front seat that time and it was too late when we realized that she won't be going home to Cabantian and will stay with her twin at Boulevard. I became anxious. This would mean that me and Dr. F will be alone for a long time. 

When Mira left, I was forced to transfer at the front seat. It was ok at first. Small talks about my health. Or so I thought. He then asked me if I had dinner and I told him that I am currently on IF and that time is my fasting period. It then started his banter on how he likes my determination and that he has been admiring me since we met. It would have been sweet but it made me uneasy. He then started touching my legs. To which I was startled. I told him, ""Doc ayaw ana. Dli gud ko ganahan na ginagunitan ko."" Then what he answered made me fear him and what he can do. ""Dili diay ka ani? Dili paka ani, hatod sundo tika. Libre na imung consultation fee pati tambal nimo."" He then resumed on holding my leg and he even caressed my left thigh. I was nervous but I vehemently told him that I don't want him and that thanks but no thanks, I can pay for my medicines and consultation fees. I told him to stop the car and that I will go home on my own. I had to swat his hands and repeat that he stop the car before he finally did. 

I finally realized that we were in Diversion Road and that the road was dark. There are no jeepneys there and taxis were full. I walked and walked. I felt humiliated and I asked myself if my stature is screaming sex. I don't know what to feel. Flashback of when my estranged husband forced himself upon me came back to me and it made me sit on the ground and cry. Angry tears are flowing down my cheeks and I don't know how long was I there. All I remember was that I was able to arrive in our house at 1 AM. I can't even imagine how I was able to walk from Diversion road to our house.

Only one person knows of what happened to me that night. 

Thus when I saw him this morning, nonchalantly smiling and walking towards me made me loathe him. ""Hi, kumusta naman ka? Nadawat nimo tung iced coffee ug mga pagkaon na akoang gipabutang dria sa lamesa nimo?"" And then it dawned on me that the person who keeps on leaving food and coffee on my table with notes of, ""I am watching you"" is him. I should have known. I asked him to leave. That I don't want anything to do with him. He upped and left. But him leaving just like that should have made me wonder and more vigilant. 

It was 12nn, I opt not to take my lunch and decided to prepare black coffee instead. I went inside our training room/pantry and it was my mistake that I did not lock the door of the office. I was holding my phone and was scrolling through my emails, with my coffee on the counter when I felt someone at my back. He was there and he covered my mouth with his hands. He started groping for my boobs and I can feel his aroused dick. I was crying while he kissed my neck and continued groping my boobs while still covering my mouth. He is vehemently saying that, ""Nisugot paka nako, dili na tana ta maabot ani. Sige pagsumbong kay akoa siguraduhon na dili naka makatrabaho maski asa. Ingnan nako akoang Daddy. Sige pakag pakipot. Dili ka nako, kwartahan ko. Sex ta pirme."" I have never been more afraid of anything at that time and at the same time I was praying that I can escape his horrendous plan. That's when I saw my coffee and while he was busy exploiting me, I threw my coffee backwards which took him by surprise and made him fumble back because it was searing hot. I ran outside the office and went inside the women's restroom and locked the door. 

I cried. I lost count of how many times I have cried this week. But I still cried. His father is one of the Board of Directors of the hospital. Yes I have plans of resigning but I can't shake the thought that he might follow me wherever I go. My hands and knees were shaking. I remembered how my estranged husband abused me. I remember J that I met here on reddit who also forced me to do something that I don't want to do. I felt dirty. I am humiliated. I felt sick. 

I don't know how long I was there. When I returned to the office, Yours, the Housekeeping personnel was cleaning the office. I got my things and told him to close the office and return the keys to the guard. I called Mama and told her that I will be late and that I had to visit Mira. But it was a lie. I just needed to be alone. I went to Ecoland and rode the bus to Tagum then back again to Davao. I did it thrice. I had to do it because I can't go home until I am sure that I am composed and that my hands and knees stopped shaking. I can't go home until I am sure that when I take my Mama’s hand to ""mano"" I won't break down. 

My tears can't stop falling while riding the bus. It was on the third trip that I felt empty. I am sad. I am tired. I wished I can ride the bus forever. I am humiliated. I never felt so dirty and abused in my life. I don't think I deserve to be treated this way. I am empty. I am empty and sad but when I left the bus and came home, I am pretty sure that no one will ever know and see the pain in my eyes. No one will ever know the hurt and countless tears I have cried.

She wanted wanted to bleed by my hands,"Not my fantasy, it was my ex's. I did partake in it.  
Her fantasy was lip bleeding from slapping. She loved getting her ass slapped, back and thighs scratched, she could take the pain and i loved it.  
While she mounted me, I slapped her face. She gave me a sly smile. She leaned forward. I slapped her again, harder this time. She stared back at me grinning with delight. ""Make my lip bleed, daddy,"" she said. I slapped her again. At this point i was getting concerned at the pain i was inflicting on her. Her cheeks looked red even though the lights were dim. I decided to choke her. She kept riding me as i held her neck in my hand. Holding her in place by her neck, i slapped her face again. She gave this evil smile and stare with her mouth open, as if she were possessed. I felt her wetness as she kept riding me. She was so into it. As i was nearing climax, she went down on her knees and braced herself as i stood up on the bed and wanked in front of her cute little face. All smiles and waiting in anticipation, she awaited her reward from me for being a good, good girl.  
""Open wide,"" I said. She obliged and stuck her tongue out as I shot my load on her cheeks, her nose, and, of course, in her mouth. As my waves of pleasure ended, she took my cock and sucked me dry.  
""I love how your cum tastes compared to others, daddy,"" she said as she swallowed and cleaned me up with her mouth. Just as she pulled my cock out of her mouth, I slapped her cum-covered face one last time. She giggled in delight.  
Aftercare ensued. From wanting to physically abuse her, I started to hold her and caress her gently, gliding my fingers softly along the red stripes i made all over her back. I caressed her red cheeks, held her chin, pulled her close, and I leaned for a kiss. I stuck my tongue inside her mouth and i tasted myself as our tongues danced in unison. I gave her gentle kisses all over her body and then we spooned.  
I did not make her bleed. I failed at attempting to make her fantasy come true, but that was definitely a one-of-a-kind experience. 

Na-miss ko siya bigla. LOL",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/14kfjuz/she_wanted_wanted_to_bleed_by_my_hands/,t2_9wv3r3p7,2023-06-27 22:39:52,4,2
I HAVE SINNED......,"So this story is about me having a relationship with somebody else gf. Yep you heard it right. Do I regret it? No, Do I feel bad for the bf? No. Before you guys bash me for this I'm aware it was wrong but the situation that i was in and circumstances it was unique experience to say the least . So I met this girl in my job, were co workers I was the new guy in the job. Basically we got really close when were both in graveyard shift since it was just the two of us. we talked about alot of things and since she was basically my senior she was teaching me all the things I needed to know about the works in graveyard. She was nice funny and we somehow kinda Vibed and had connection, we became best friend's in that 1 whole week of being together. I even met her bf once and even shook hands with me. Anyways I started to develop feelings for her which I kept away because duh she has bf and I enjoyed our friendship.

So fast forward she starts talking about how she is getting jealous of her bf having a best friend girl because they would always seem so clingy to the point they say MAHAL as there nickname, and I told her it shouldn't be a big deal since there just friends, but she always had a suspicion that her bf was cheating on him. Now the reason why I never felt bad for fucking the dudes gf because as time went by I realized the boyfriend was an asshole, she would constantly tell stories about how abusive he was, he didn't hit her or anything but you got simple red flags like verbal abuse etc etc and there was one point the bf nearly drove her to commit suicide once and I had to fucking stop her from doing it (I won't explain the suicide part because this story is super long already but if people say yes in the comments I will tell no problem"") So yeah the bf is an asshole, there was even time she got cried and hugged me and said she can't take it anymore. I never took this as chance to steal her away, but it kinda felt like I was the bf at times since I was the one comforting her and making sure she knew she was beautiful. I was basically making sure she wasn't sad. 

Now this is when thing's get dramatic. The boyfriend start's to get jealous of me which is weird because I never tried to flirt with her or even signs that I was flirting with her gf, I was just being a nice co worker to her, It turns out the boyfriend has a massive jealousy issues which is ironic af because her gf has always had an issues with his best friend girl but always said there just friends and she shouldn't be such a jealous person. So the boyfriend says to her that she should never talk to me ever again or else. When she told me that my heart stopped...I was scared and this is the part were I talk about my sins now..I felt like I was gonna lose her if I didn't say anything to her so I told her my feelings I said ""Ayaw Kita mawala bes, grabeh Naman FO na ganon ganon lng"" and she ask why, why was I being this dramatic and I said ""dahil gusto kita... gustong gusto kita""..she was shocked and that's were it started.

It didn't help that boyfriend was still continuing to be an asshole like mistreating her, not giving her attention, verbal abuse as usual, and since I told her my feelings for her she started to become alot closer, The sins started in our Christmas party...she was little drunk because of the alcohol, I didn't really get to enjoy the party since I was in duty during the Christmas party nice lol. So we went to the storage room and that's where I kissed her...she was shocked yet she liked it alot.. Couple of days past that storage room became make out room for us, She taught alot of things like how to user ur tongue in kissing, it was intense she was really experienced, one time I really got horny and started rubbing her panties while she was on top of me making out. .mind you were still on duty during that makeout session,, she moaned a bit and sucked my fingers.

The biggest sin happened is when me and her bf got into a fight..and she called me after the fight and said if was okay..I said I was. She said she was sorry that when were fighting she couldn't side with me...And this When it happened were I finally commited the biggest sin ever. Having sex with another man's gf..she decided to come home and fix my bruises and my black eye because of the fight...we were both tired it was raining that time and we went to our room...we both stared at each other until we finally kissed and makeout again...my dick was fucking hard but I wanted to play with her body before anything else. I fingered her slowly and fast, making sure each stroker she was getting teased, she was moaning alot bitting her lip, I wanted her to beg for my dick a that point and she did.

""please mark kantutin moh na ako pls"" she said while i was teasing her and fingering her pussy, I said ""gusto moh ba eh Pano si Joshua? Diba Mahal mo sha?"" And then she said ""Hindi Di ko na sha Mahal mark ikaw na Mahal ko so please kantutin moh na ako"" and from that  had her, I showed her my dick and slided it inside her pussy that was wet because of the foreplay I did, I kept fucking her and fucking her she kept asking her the same question ""Sino Mahal moh?"", I kept asking that, she refused to answer until I threatened to pull out my dick, and she finally said 'Ikaw mark ikaw Mahal ko, Di ko na Mahal si Joshua ikaw na Mahal ko"". She was brainwashed by my dick she was soo easy to manipulate when it comes to sex, I even said ""sino mas malake?"" And of course she said ""ikaw mark lake nang tite tangina ka"" (btw umm her bf was fat and she was skinny so yeah I kinda understand why I was bigger lol btw if ur curious my dick is 6inches and I'm also 6 footer)...and wanna know the most fucked up part? Her bf was calling and messaging her saying sorry that he did what he did, she saw those messages and i threw the phone away and continued to fuck her hard. We did everything that from doggie, missionary, blowjob finger etc. While her bf was trying to call her.

It felt amazing tbh, it seemed like a story straight out of porn video about cheating. We continued to fuck for 3 days after the first sex day.

And that's were I end my story ladies and gents..Do I regret what I did? A little because I knew it was wrong but the circumstances that I was in, who wouldn't wanna say yes to that...do I feel bad for the boyfriend? No lol I mean that's what happens when you don't take care of your gf and even drove her into suicide..she is bound to find other dick to pleasure her.

So if there is moral story to all of this....Please never verbaly abuse ur girlfriend or drive them to suicide. 
 

Btw those names I used In the story are not true I can't say my real name or put the real names of those people because privacy.",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/in7taf/i_have_sinned/,t2_7wm6ejp2,2020-09-06 04:00:06,0,14
Primboi,"Last night I posted an r4r ad about wanting to be fucked semi rough. I received a handful of immediate messages so had to weed them off by asking who they voted for, the list became short in a span of minutes and those who didn’t send selfies right away were seenzoned. Damn, there’s a lot of good-looking guys on Reddit but good-looking guys are not really my type. I was after the mature-looking guys. But anyway, I didn’t get what I wanted physically speaking. So, I went after how they communicated and luckily this guy and I had a convo prior like, last year so he already said his fave book writes good English so I gave him the location and room number. 


So, he’s about the same age as mine, slim, actually cute. Easy on the eye kind of guy plus nice hands. Okay, first off, I’m awkward at initiating things so was glad when he went immediately to the bed and sat. I knew he wanted to fuck me the minute he saw me so I excused myself for a bit and went to the rest room and gargled. So Yup, when I went out, he reached and kissed me, I reciprocated all right, smelled of old spice. Fuck, damn. 


He pulled my dress up, unhooked my bra and I unbuttoned his shirt, reached down and felt his cock. Jackpot! Fuck, this guy, perfect cock, perfect girth and hard. I knew right there and then that Im gonna get what I asked and immediately felt my wetness. Fuck this guy should fucking deliver or else im gonna cry and he delivered all right. 


He ate my pussy like it’s the only meal in the world, he ate it and licked it like it the best tasting pussy ever, I moaned hard and Im not a loud moaner mind you, but damn this guy got some mad skills. I totally lost it when he put his finger inside me, he finger fucked me while he was eating my pussy I have lost all the sanity I have left at this point. I also like that he’s verbal and was moaning too made me feel like he was enjoying what he was doing to me too and it felt good, made me feel less conscious.


When it was my turn, I still couldn’t believe how perfect his cock is. I sucked his dick like my life depended on it. Choked, gagged, licked his balls, played with it inside my mouth went back to the tip of head and worked my tongue while he pulled my hair and guided me with the right rhythm. I said that I finally want him to fuck me. Grabbed his condom and immediately pulled me on the edge of the bed and fucked me, Ecstatic. He raged fucked me just as I wanted, fuck, Leni lost and we were both sad and mad at the world so we fucked, fucked the hatred into this world. I said that I was his slut, im his pokpok and a lot of curses in between. “tangina mo! Gago! Ang sarap mo! Ibaon mo yan! Gago! Ka! Hayop ka! Putangina mo!” I may have verbally abused him while lolling out of my sanity. 


He let me stand on the edge of the bed and fucked me from behind, we used the chair, edge of the table, almost bumped my head into the TV lol! I wished we did anal though but maybe he wasn’t ready which was okay, and wished he slapped me. Would’ve been extra hot. 


He fucked me thrice in a span of two hours yup, pussy is sore. Lol!


I don’t always cum during penetration but damn this guy did it twice and it was life changing fucking epiphany. Haha!


Over all great skillful dude, 11/10 would fuck again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/uqrdjb/primboi/,t2_9pkibj0j,2022-05-16 16:51:02,96,2
when i was seventeen,"I recently turned 18 and I figured I will be posting stories of my sexual adventures/misadventures from my first time hanggang sa 18 years old na ako. (ex. When I was 16) 

I've always been into talking with strangers ever since nagkaroon ako ng access sa internet. I was seventeen and I had a cousin who had recently gotten married. Nagpapatayo sila ng bahay sa compound namin when a hot guy enetered my lola's house. He looked around 23-25 y.o., tall, moreno and had this beautiful set of lips! Turns out, he was the architect. BUUUUUT he's not the guy who fucked me... It was his colleague.


Late 2018, I met a guy on a dating/livestreaming app. His profile caught my attention because aside from having curly hair (one of my fetishes) and nerdy glasses, he was just 4km away.. easy. I checked his profile and ding! He instantly messaged me. And so we talked.. what I knew about him was that his name was Levi (I changed it for privacy purposes), he was 25, and that he worked as a janitor sa isang water company. He made me believe na yun nga ang trabaho niya! And so we talked more hanggang sa sinabi nga niya na he was an architect. And what he knew about me was that I was 18 and a student. (Don't worry, inamin ko naman na 17 lang ako around New Year)

Chats turned into phone calls.. late night phone calls iykwim. *wink wink* Levi was a dom bit he didn't look the part, all the more reason na na-intrigue ako. January 2019, we decided to meet up. Initially, magcocoffee lang sana kami but we both decided sa hotel na lang magpunta. :P History happened. Naulit pa ulit yon twice, malapit nang matapos yung bahay na ipinapagawa ng pinsan ko. Haha.

 I've always had this kink na I get fucked by guys that my close friends/family are acquainted to pero they had no single clue. Don't you find it arousing na you can get away with stuff.. dirty stuff. I just find it hot that I'm hooking up with my cousin's architect's colleague. Quite a mouthful, no? But so is his dick. ;)",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/cb0qrs/when_i_was_seventeen/,t2_3nhknhc3,2019-07-09 21:15:52,32,10
