I'm a 16-year-old who wants to run away from home at 19. Does anybody have tips? [TW: physical and emotional abuse],"I'm gonna tell something about myself first. I'm from Cavite. I just turned 16 in March. My family seems to be the nicest people you'll meet. They volunteer at church, they volunteer for Leni, and they help people out during crisis. But they're never there for me and my two younger brothers.

I am undiagnosed, but I've been dealing with symptoms of OCD since I was 10-years-old. It got really worse when I turned 14, and I keep getting intrusive thoughts and I'm anxious 24/7. I opened up about it to my family, but I shouldn't have. They said if I don't stop, they're going to exorcise me or lock me up in a mental asylum. They told me they don't want to help me, because they're embarrassed of me. They don't want our neighbors to find out that somebody in the family is mentally unstable. And almost every day, they're insulting me about it and kept calling me crazy.

(While I am writing this, my mom purposely tried to break a mug because she's mad at me while verbally abusing me. She's also shaming me in front of my family. She just called me ""walang kwenta"" and ""malandi"". I'm currently hiding right now just so I could use my phone.)

I had a boyfriend, but we broke up which led me into a lot of breakdowns every week. He's manipulative and I left him so I could work on myself and my studies. I've been doing bad in my studies coz I get exhausted from dealing with my mental health, and it would've help me a lot if my family just listened to me instead of silencing me. Whenever I breakdown about the things I'm dealing with, my mom verbally abuses me as if I have no rights to cry. I couldn't vent to anybody too coz I can only vent to my vent to my boyfriend, but he was just using me for his own happiness.

I just wish I could live normally without these people. There's not a day where I'm not insulted, manipulated, or gaslighted. I feel like I exist just so they have somebody that they could talk shit about. And it's been stressful for me and I just want to have a peace of mind.


Now I'm gonna explain why I want to leave and run away from home. My family, especially my mom and grandma, always verbally uses me. They won't leave me alone. Whenever I want space, they won't respect that. Instead, they'd insult me. And they always get mad at me. every time I open up to them about my insecurities, they get mad. When I tell them about my little every day achievements, rhey'd talk shit about me. Sometimes their getting mad at me turns into physical abuse. They'd often hit me and throw things on me instead of letting me explain. That's how they silence me. I try my best to be the daughter that they want me to be, but I'm always a failure to them. Also, if I don't get out of here, I can't get help for my mental health. I couldn't work on myself here because when I do, my family always brings me down.

Currently, I am looking for jobs suitable for me so I could at least earn money before I leave, but I have no idea how. I'm planning to do well with my studies too. Any tips? I just don't wanna spend more years of my life here. Thank you btw! :D

(i'm sorry if this is long, i don't post a lot on reddit. im sorta scared of posting too so pls dont judge T~T)


TL;DR: looking for a job and tips to leave my physically and emotionally abusive family before i turn 19.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/twobrr/im_a_16yearold_who_wants_to_run_away_from_home_at/,t2_i8c8783o,2022-04-05 14:18:14,37
Moving out/running away from my emotionally abusive father who was away for 10 years,"tl;dr: emotionally abusive OFW father recently came home after 10 years and we had a huge fight which made me too uncomfortable too stay in this house. Already planned to move out even before he came home but he might think I'm moving out because of him (tho it's also true). I don't know how to tell him that I'm moving out knowing his tendencies

Hello, I’m 23 years old and my father was an OFW for 10 years. I won't go into details sa history ng pagiging emotionally abusive/manipulative niya before and during the time na nasa abroad siya since that would be too long considering na mahaba din yung story.

Anyways, umuwi siya last month and since di sila okay ng mother ko, umalis na yung mother ko sa bahay so natira kami ng kuya ko. Nung first two days ang bait niya so naisip ko parang ang judgemental ko na inisip ko mga masasamang bagay sa kanya dati but then I was immediately proved wrong.

On the second night pumasok siya sa kwarto ko nang lasing at 1 AM and patulog na ako since may work pa the next day. Verbatimly sabi niya “lasing tatay mo” and then proceed to ask some questions, catching up ganun and at the same time ilang beses niya inuulit na na tabi daw kami matulog and despite me saying no multiple times, lumapit pa rin siya at tumabi. At first wala akong ginawa since tatabi lang naman but then sumiksik siya nang sumiksik and that’s when I got uncomfortable so tumayo ako at lumabas ng kwarto para sana uminom ng tubig pero sumunod siya sa baba so tumakbo ako pabalik ng kwarto and nilock yung pinto.

He kept on knocking and calling for my name pero ang sagot ko lang ay “matulog ka na pa bukas na tayo mag usap pag di ka na lasing” but of course he kept on denying na lasing siya. Eventually he said “sisirain ko ‘tong pinto mo” and started banging on the door loudly tapos may ginagawa pa siyang di ko alam sa doorknob so I started shouting saying na ipapabarangay ko siya pag di siya tumigil but he didn’t stop and confidently said “oh sige” until he finally opened the door without a key. That alone was scary plus may expression pa sa mukha niya na di ko maexplain basta nakakatakot so tumakbo ako malapit sa kwarto ng kuya ko just in case na may gawin siya.

Sumunod siya then he started his manipulative sad boi session saying na 10 years siya nagsakripisyo para samin tapos ganun lang turing ko sa kanya, how he always wanted to go to college dati pero hindi kaya ng parents niya so nag OFW siya para hindi namin maexperience yun. Hindi daw siya nanunumbat but kept on saying na hindi ako makakapag aral sa ganitong school kung di dahil sa kanya which is factually wrong since yung nanay ko yung nababaon sa utang para lang makabayad sa tuition namin dahil bihira siya magpadala. Sinisigawan niya ko the whole time habang dinuduro duro ako. Nakipag sigawan din ako asking questioning his actions that night then I made mention of the other traumatizing things he did and how he never realized that he's wrong but he kept on mentioning the 10 years/gusto niya magcollege. I ended it by saying na hindi ko naman ginusto mabuhay bakit siya nag anak tapos isusumbat niya lang lahat.

Days after that he started acting nice again cooking my favorite foods, other acts of service, etc but there was no apology, he’s acting like nothing happened and that we’re ok. I mean gets naman na ganun yung karamihan ng parents but the experience was not the same for me. Until now I’m still anxious whenever we’re in the same room so I’m trying my best para umiwas magtatanong nga lang kung kumain na ako kumakabog na dibdib ko. Di siya kumakatok sa pinto bago pumasok so iniiwan ko nalang na bukas para marinig ko and maready ko sarili ko pag papasok siya. And lastly tuwing iinom siya (around 3 times a week) kailangan ko i-barricade yung pinto sa takot. Basta this home is no longer a safe place for me and gusto ko na lumipat plus kami rin naman ng kuya ko yung nagbabayad sa lahat ng gastusin.

May nakita na akong lilipatan na malapit dun sa area kung saan nagsstay nanay ko tho dito pa rin sa barangay yung place. Pinapalipat na ko next week and I don't know kung pano ako magpapaalam without any drama knowing na may sadboi tendencies nga yung tatay ko. Tbh plan ko na talaga lumipat ng bahay by the end of the year bago pa umuwi yung tatay ko, baka kasi isipin niya na lilipat ako ng bahay dahil sa kanya tho it's true, hindi naman yun yung sole reason.   


I don't know what reactions I will get since the last time na nagpost ako dito about him natawag akong ""entitled brat"" for not appreciating his sacrifice despite showing evidence of him being an asshole but I just wanted to share my experience and maybe get some advice on how to tell him that I'm moving out",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/r6d7on/moving_outrunning_away_from_my_emotionally/,t2_h43j1slv,2021-12-01 20:01:35,7
How to deal with an emotional abuser?,"My stepdad is freaking drunk and threatening to kill my dogs, throw me out of the house if I so much as clean their pen. Then when I walked out on him and ignores, he thens threathens to leave. Now, he wants me to beg him not to leave. I've become the bad guy in the house when I don't want to give into his whims. 
We've had this song and dance a number of times wherein I catipulate and asks him not to leave. But he'd never threathen to kill my dogs and throw me out before. So, I have no fucks to give if he wants to have his drama.
edit:
Now, he's threathening to kill my cousins.
edit: After listening to his angry threats, I couldn't take it anymore and had to face him. Assuage his ego. Nod my head and agree to everything he says. Now, he's all smiles and gloating that we shouldn't disrespect him anymore. Also, he wants me to accompany him while he eats a late lunch. I'm hoping this blows over and he forgets why he's angry after he sleeps.
My gran, my depressed mom and my agorapobic self are no matched against him. I'm at fault too, I've gotten used to this kind of treatment for years.

Rant: Romanticizing abuse in wattpad books.,"I was 12 or 13 years old when I first started my wattpad journey.  I admitted I was into this type of novels na kung saan ung bad boy na inlove sa good girl, ito ang karamihan na kinakikiligan lagi ng mga kabataan. Ang  disturbing pa ay tumaas ang kanilang ""standard"" kuno sa mga lalaki pero nung binasa ko ang book ng character nila eh puro nalang egoism, emotional abuse and physical abuse ang pinoportray ng character. Minsan makakabasa ka rin ng stockholm and lima syndrome.  Ang mas malala mga babae pa ang nagsusulat ng mga ganitong novels.

Napaka talamak ng ganitong stories in this age na pinaglalaban natin ang equality and respect sa bawat isa.

The Philippines is mostly Pro-Lesbian but Anti-Gay,"This is not a hate post. I just want to understand why from the very beginning, in the early 1950s up until the present, that there's no hard stigma against Lesbians, but Gays are often condemned and mocked by society? Filipino Lesbians are out in the open from the very beginning, but society doesn't have any negative remarks nor judgement against them. They are always welcomed by society. I haven't heard of a story, past nor present, that a Lesbian Filipina suffered from physical nor emotional abuse from homophobic parents, peers and colleagues, but there's plenty of horrifying stories of what Filipino Gay Men have to suffer under the brutality of their parents and colleagues just because they're gay. Society has always been kind and mild towards lesbians, but harsh and brutal towards gay men in the Philippines. 

I hope people may enlighten me about our culture, on why this is.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/184x572/the_philippines_is_mostly_prolesbian_but_antigay/,t2_i6vjsyazl,2023-11-27 15:11:32,0
"I live in an abusive household, and I want to leave but they won't let me.","I tagged NSFW because of some things I may mention might trigger others. So fair warning.

I'm from the Philippines, I'm 18F. I have a very verbally, physically, and emotionally abusive mother, my dad and sister's the same except not physically abusive. I have an older brother who has autism and have >!sexually assaulted!< me when I was young but nobody believes me since he's ""autistic"". He has also let out his anger on me whenever he had tantrums growing up, and it only recently stopped.

I have been diagnosed with a dependent personality disorder, depression, and anxiety.>! I have attempted suicide on multiple occasions but failed. My family makes me want to kill myself everyday.!<

The abuse is very apparent everyday, and I swore to the day I turned 18, I will move out. My mother has taken my legal documents, (which I have on me again temporarily, I used university applications as an excuse for her to give it to me.) My bank account is legally still bounded to my mother so any transactions I make, she can see. If I try to do anything with it, she will beat the life out of me.

My sister doesn't help. She would do everything to snitch on any attempt she catches me that is against my parents' house rules. I don't even see her as my own sister anymore.

I've considered moving out of the country just to cut all contacts with them.

I don't have any jobs that pays, but I want to so I could be able to financially help myself. I want to move out to a safer place. Someone, please, help me. I don't have anyone to turn to.

EDIT (as of 11:54 AM, 24/11/2021):  
To everyone who have gave an advice, reached out through dms, sent encouraging messages, gave loving comments, and gentle reminders to take care of myself—thank you. With my utmost sincerity, and wholeheartedly, want to let you know that I appreciate each, and every single one of you. I have teared up and even sobbed because I'm quite a stranger to this act of kindness as I was deprived of this growing up. 

I used to think that living life was impossible for someone like me, pero naiintindihan ko rin na it will get better as long as I try to keep fighting and finding better ways to cope. It's really hard to live in the same house of your abusers, hence why I am trying to leave. I will take all of your advice that are logical, safe, and ensured to put me in a better place.

I love you all. Thank you.

I'll update in the near future, or a year or two from now.

Gusto ko sanang magtanong kung meron bang mga tao na galing sa healthy at emotionally supportive family dito? Ano feeling? Pano kayo magcommunicate? Mag-ayos ng problema sa isa't-isa? Bakit mabait parents niyo? (Chos haha. Pero di nga? As in, lumaki sa bugbog pero na-break yung cycle?) Halos lahat kasi ng nakapaligid sakin ay galing sa abusive na pamilya e.

Pero imagine kasi wala na kayong makain buong pamily tas nagtatrabaho ka para makakain ka at makapag-ipon ng sarili mong pampaaral, tas hihingin ng magulang mo para lang mag shopping?) Ako naman lumaking emotionally neglected. Ang hirap isipin kung pano umakto ang healthy and supportive family. Obviously di sila abusive pero kasi, pano yung support and communication niyo? Tangina kahit ikwento mo talambuhay mo babasahin ko yan para lang malaman at maintindihan ko kung pano nagwowork ang healthy fam.

Don't get me wrong, I know healthy families and good parents exist here. But I can't imagine talaga kung pano sila... Umasta? It's easier to imagine abusive families because that's what I know.

Child grooming in the Philippines,"I am a victim of child grooming during my adolescence and as an advocacy, I want to conduct a research about the lived experiences of my fellow victims who have survived. This is for the purpose of raising awareness and prevention. Does anyone here want to share their story? Preferably Filipino victims. Rest assured this will be confidential and private. You can hide your identity. 

Let's chat more about the details if you guys are interested.


For those who doesn't know what grooming is:

Grooming is when someone (adult) builds a relationship, trust and emotional connection with a child or young person to increase the likelihood of manipulation, exploitation and sexual abuse. A groomer can be someone in the environment of the child. For example, teacher, family friend, relative, pastor, and etc. They can be anyone. 

Stages in the process of grooming involves 
(1) Targeting potential victims 
(2) Building trust and friendship 
(3) Isolating the child 
(4) Initiation of abuse and maintaining secrecy

Grooming can go unnoticed because the groomer usually befriends and builds trust with the victim's guardians and other people in the community in order for them not be suspicious of the perpetrator's actions.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/qxykcd/child_grooming_in_the_philippines/,t2_c5x0t2oz,2021-11-20 13:18:59,253
Child custody on the basis of a possibly unfit parent.,"Seeking help.
(1) Who gets child custody between unmarried and split parents of children above the age of 6 years old? 
(2) What constitutes an unfit parent?

Anyone know where to find the legal basis?

TLDR: The father is the only one working and supporting the children. He experiences emotional abuse from the mother. The mother is unemployed, and constantly threatens and blackmails the father to take away the children if they don’t get back together.

Full situation: 
Father is the only one working and supporting the children. Mother is employed and has no plans to work. 

Father and mother has been in an on and off again relationship for around a decade years. Father continued to stay for the sake of the children, but could not take the emotional and verbal abuse of the mother anymore. The last they called it off, the mother initiated the break up. During the last break up, she specifically uttered to him that she wouldn’t care if he died. She tried to get back together with him, but the father didn’t give in this time. He, however, still supports and care for the children. Mother starts to threaten the father to take away the children if they do not get back together and if he gets together with someone else. When the father was in a relationship, the mother would constantly message his new partner to stay away. When the mother was blocked by the partner, she created another account to continue to stalk and harass her. Mother has had different boyfriends since their break up, and is currently in a relationship with one. Mother also creates fake chat screenshots between them containing false information and sending it to the fathers family, friends and partner to ruin his reputation. She currently threatens to send those fake screenshots to his co-workers, but hasn’t done so. Mother claims she just want to be a whole family again, but also tells the children that their father doesn’t love them, so that they would stay away from the father. This causes the children to cry and be bothered by it for a couple of days, even though it’s not true.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/157sipc/child_custody_on_the_basis_of_a_possibly_unfit/,t2_5xhu5qzpd,2023-07-24 06:34:16,3

Entitled Filipino Relatives,"I just have to vent real quick about my mom’s situation. Not too long ago my mom told me that her brother posted something vile on her Facebook page. He said something along the lines of “are you not going to send money?” First of, it sounded so rude to demand money and post it on her page when this topic could’ve been dealt privately. First off, my mom didn’t have a good relationship with her mom and her brother growing up. Her mom neglected her and sent her to her grandparents. My mom’s brother was also very physically and emotionally abusive towards my mom. There were instances where my mom would get slapped in her teenage years. It was only after we moved to Canada where they suddenly cared about my mom so much. But in then end, they always demanded money. It’s not even just her brother but his entire family that demands money from my mom. Their reason is that my grandma’s old and she needs money. But we never really get updates about her visits at the doctor.However, we do see photos of their family going out, having parties just a couple of days after my mom sends money to the Philippines. I told my mom that the instant her mom neglected her that should’ve been an indication that she won’t be part of my mom’s life anymore. 

It’s been tough for my mom financially and emotionally because my Dad passed away a year ago. Yet, her brother never asks my mom how she is, all he cares about is her money.

EDIT: hello everyone, I just wanna say how thankful I am for all your kind words and pieces of advice. I had a conversation with my mom not too long ago and with your help, I convinced her to block her brother and his family. She still shows a bit of worry towards her mom but I think an insurance would be a better option for her than sending money directly to them. So thank you!

Ngayon, I'm 23000 USD in student loan debt kasi nag-back out sila sa pangako nila sa nanay ko. On top of that, pinuwersa nila akong magtrabaho sa opisina nila kahit ilegal sa visa ko. Once a week lang pero limang taon ako ""nagtrabaho"" dun nang walang sweldo bukod pa sa pagiging katulong nila sa bahay. Ako na mismo yung tagalaba, tagaluto, tagalinis, kapag may party sila, ako na din yung server—lahat na ginawa ko. 

Kung tutuusin, kaya ko naman yung lahat na yan pero yung hindi ko talaga makayanan ay yung emotional abuse. Palagi akong pinapahiya ng tita ko in public and private, may it be my English/our dialect, my skin tone, my family history, my weight, my hair, my driving, etc. Hindi ko makakalimutan yung isang beses dinefend ko yung sarili ko in public. She was making fun of my weight. Sabi ko, ""Wag naman, tita. May nakakarinig sa iyo."" 

Ang sabi nya lang is: ""Oh so what? They won't remember."" Except for me. I remember. And I remember the time na sinabunutan nya ako in public kasi pinaghintay ko daw sya nang matagal... Ni nanay ko hindi kami sinasaktan nang ganyan. 

Grabe yung depression at anxiety na dinanas ko sa kanila. Limang taon ng emotional abuse at exploitation to the point na nag-therapy at CBD na ako... 

Anyway, kahit hindi na ako nakatira sa kanila, napaka-entitled pa rin nila sa oras ko. Bawat tawag at text nila sakin, nakaka-trigger ng anxiety. After months of no contact, out of nowhere tinext ako ng tita ko as if to reprimand me for not communicating with them. (Duh?)

Medyo takot ako sa tita ko because of those events pero ayaw ko rin maging pushover sa kanya. Kung kayo yung nasa posisyon ko, pano nyo sya sasagutin? How do you set the boundaries without ""disrespecting"" your elders? Ang hirap rumespeto sa taong sya na nga ang walang respeto sayo.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/yf0ou5/rant_lang_at_advice_needed/,t2_5fkgflx5,2022-10-28 03:18:20,5
Grounds to file a restraining order against a parent?,"Meron bang judge sa Philippines that would find merit in granting a restraining order filed by an adult child vs a parent?

Suppose the child actually has a diagnosed health problem wherein a physician recommends staying away from stress and any stressors to prevent worsening of the illness. Suppose the cause of stress is also seconded by years of sessions with both a psychiatrist and a psychologist. In this case, the mother is the constant stressor throughout the child's life.

Issues:
- no physical abuse during childhood
- very high on emotional abuse and neglect
- physical and financial needs met (that's why she gets away with it)
- mother denies adult child's mental health problems
- when adult child applied for a Psychosocial PWD ID (with doctor's endorsement), mother just asked ""di mo talagang kayang icontrol na lang?"" In fear na it will be known sa Munisipyo staff na gagawa ng ID.
- child has a current diagnosis wherein medication is needed daily
- child developed poor eating habits due to constant nagging during mealtimes growing up.
- adult child calls out mother's behavior every time and how she can do better but she gets mad and doesn't listen
- at the same time, she asks where she went wrong pero walang balak magbago
- child is undergoing possible screening for undiagnosed autism in adults so child actually experiences an adult version of a tantrum and mother's response is to yell back
- pretty much every solution is to yell back at the child (despite husband's constant advise not to yell at child during a tantrum)
- friends and family always excuse her by saying ""ganyan talaga yan""
- mother is panganay among panganays so nobody actually stands up to her
- husband is deceased so nobody can tell her how to parent

Apart from just cutting ties with the mother, it helps to prove a point with a restraining order in place because all attempts to tell her what she doing wrong to give a chance to change doesn't work.

Is there merit to a judge granting a restraining order filed by an adult child vs a parent?

Mother is a senior but has many other relatives at home to care for her so she's not really at home if her only child leaves and goes no-contact.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/14f0itz/grounds_to_file_a_restraining_order_against_a/,t2_tluexage,2023-06-21 15:16:01,0
What steps to take to formally file complaint against abusive relatives living in the same house?,"(Long post ahead! But please, take the time to read. I'd like to ask for help.)

Hello. I am an 18 year old college freshman with two younger siblings, 14F and 11M. As the title says, I'm looking for a way to formally file a complaint against our relatives, an aunt and her son (our cousin), which currently live in the same small house as ours.

As you can imagine, madaming tension. It's very rare to find a day of peace, lalo na when the extended family also lives in the same compound and are equally squammy warfreaks. 

My main cause of concern for filing a complaint is that I have no idea how to take the first steps. This is my first year being 18 and I don't even have any useable valid gov IDs as of the moment. I'm also not well-equipped to travel in the case of having to file complaints physically due to financial restraints and my limited knowledge of commuting. I just fear for the worst for me and my siblings.

Some background to all of this: 
Every day we are trapped in this house, we aren't treated like humans. Worst of all, father nalang namin kasama namin sa bahay, and he doesn't know or even dare to defend us, either, in all the years na nagdudusa kami dito. The main argument of all our toxic relatives is ""Edi sana sumama nalang kayo sa nanay niyo."" Like it was that easy, when she's living with the family of her current boyfriend (where the BF knows we exist, but his family does not, let alone know that my mother has an existing marriage she turned her back on). In short, oo, the entire family (father's side) is toxic, the classic filipino family tree that looks more like a cesspool than a ""family"", na may away sa lupa, and anything under the sun.
 
Me and my siblings are also viewed as ""perwisyo"", and worse than just garbage for simply existing, kase pinapahirapan pa daw namin ang lola namin since iniwan kami ng mother namin here when she left. This impression of me and my siblings existed as far back as when I was a toddler, where even as a young child they would call me ""abnormal"", or ""autistic"", ableist, disgusting names that a child should never be called, most especially in the most degrading way possible. We suffer the brunt of this abuse in the hands of our own aunt, cousin, and aforementioned lola. 

To recall some of the things we've endured while growing up (besides the name calling), we've always been verbally and emotionally abused, na kahit bata pa kami nasasabihan na kami na ""Lasunin niyo nalang 'yang mga yan, total perwisyo lang dito sa bahay"". My memory fails to surface the more repressed memories, but name-calling, belittling, and the occassional physical abuse have always been a key part of our childhood here. 

More recently, they have continued this harassment in more ways. Nagkaroon ng isa pang anak ang aunt namin, and he's currently a toddler. He's being taught constantly to call us names (eg. autistic/auti, bobo) instead of using our real names, and has followed in the footsteps of his older brother and mother. There has also been two instances so far where we left our shared bed unattended and it suddenly had been sprinkled with white sugar all over (likely an attempt to have pests and insects bite us). For it to happen twice is no coincidence, but my lola always turns a blind eye to it.

My lola is included in the list of perpetrators because, in simple words, kunsintidor siya. She lets them teach the toddler derogatory words, she doesn't believe us when we say our bed was sprinkled with sugar, and she doesn't bat an eye, or say anything when we are called names, verbally abused or even hit with a snide side comment when we aren't even doing anything except for existing. 

Just tonight, an hour before writing this post, me and my siblings came home to our shoes and slippers missing. We found it some time later, when we saw that they were scattered across our bed. Maybe that was the breaking point, and I had lashed out at my grandmother — to do something, say something, speak to them, before I let myself do something bad to them. She had the audacity to say ""tama na"" and call me a doña for wanting her to stop tolerating and defending her abusive daughter and grandson. I would understand simple favoritism, but to turn a blind eye to all this for so many years, you honestly can't use ""Eh 'yung mga kalokohan mo nga kinukunsinte ko din"", when we don't sprinkle sugar on their beds and purposefully trash our property when it inconveniently gets in their way. 

I have no idea where to begin to start change in this household we have no choice but to survive in, and it's even harder when no one in the family is on our side. Me and my siblings are not perfect and we are not saints, we are young and rebellious to a degree, yes — but that doesn't warrant them treating us like nasty pests all our lives when we didn't ask for it.

I will answer any relevant questions if this post gains traction. I just really need help right now, thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/18uiy8g/what_steps_to_take_to_formally_file_complaint/,t2_2nq2o6p3,2023-12-31 00:09:47,17
A psychologist's take on why DDS still support Duterte (saw this on Facebook),"From Von Guintu on Facebook:

 

A PSYCHOLOGIST'S TAKE ON WHY DDS STILL SUPPORT DUTERTE. AND NO. IT IS NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE STUPID.

A lot of people are understandably confused right now. How can anyone still support the President after all of this? Reasonable people deem that Duterte’s actions are no longer excusable, YET there are still people out there who defend him vigorously and passionately. Unsurprisingly, a lot of people are also quick to dismiss DDS as simply lacking in intelligence for continuing to support him. I’m afraid it’s a lot more complicated than that. In fact, I would even go so far as to say that intelligence has very little to do with it. The answer lies in the way our minds are predisposed to think. I will present two possible explanations here.

 1. The first has something to do with our tendency to mistakenly think that we need to keep doing what we’re doing because we have invested too much and for too long already. This way of thinking is known as sunk cost fallacy. Have you ever found yourself keeping an item of clothing that you NEVER wear simply because you paid so much for it? Or you keep it because it has sentimental value? That’s the kind of thinking that I am talking about here. My contention is that this pattern of thinking may be observed among loyalists. Consider only the level of emotional investment that people have had in the idea of Duterte as a leader. The emotional investment is so profound that not a few friendships or even familial relationships have been sacrificed over it. The level of investment has had a personal tone to it from the start. A lot of people really did believe that Duterte was the answer to our collective problems. 

 It is also important to note at this point that the emotional investment in the idea of Duterte can be made vicariously through group endorsement. For people belonging to a tight-knit group who support Duterte, the investment is not so much about their personal belief in Duterte as it is about their belief in the wisdom of their group. But whether the emotional investment in Duterte was made through personal or group choice, what is important to take note of is the amount of time doing so. Time increases the sense of importance of the investment. Which means that to retract their position now would mean that all of that emotional and personal investment will be for nothing. Most people cannot bear to think about that. It’s a similar thinking pattern for people trapped in unhealthy relationships: “Why stay in this relationship if it’s not working?” “5 years na kami eh…. We’ve been through so much already.” 

 What complicate matters further for those who have continued to support Duterte is the perceived implication of their withdrawal of support at this critical stage: it would be like admitting that they were wrong in the first place. For some, that is a far worse thing to do than accept that Duterte is not the man they hoped he was. This is especially true for those belonging in a tight-knit group who supported Duterte because it puts into question not just their personal choice but the collective wisdom of their entire group for supporting Duterte to begin with. That’s hard pill to swallow. The cognitive dissonance resulting from that would be overwhelming to say the least. So, it is not surprising to see DDS come up with convoluted reasons to justify their support for Duterte at this point. They’re not defending Duterte, they are defending their egos. The rationalization is their only way to deal with the cognitive dissonance. 

2. A second possible explanation for the continued support of Duterte is the mistaken belief that many who stay in unhealthy relationships also hold: that maybe, this person I have invested in will change THIS TIME. A lot of DDS seem to hold this belief as well often making excuses for Duterte. “He’s not perfect. He’s doing his best.” “Give him a chance”. This pattern of thinking is reflected in what is known as Gambler’s Fallacy. We seem to think that after a series of unlucky streak, our time to win is bound to happen. But that’s not true. If you enter into a relationship with an abusive partner, you can only reasonably expect abuse. Some may argue that people change and that is certainly true. But it is also important to remember that some traits are relatively stable overtime especially the older we get.

These two patterns of thinking are what helps DDS in dealing with the uncomfortable feeling brought about by cognitive dissonance. They believe Duterte is the answer, but they see evidence that he is not. It's a coping mechanism.

So what then do we do? I will leave that for another time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/ftkaal/a_psychologists_take_on_why_dds_still_support/,t2_11fys8,2020-04-02 18:51:23,193
"It was not just because of who they voted for, it was the last straw","Some people are thinking that cutting off relationships (family, friends) and limiting their help are solely from the choice of supporting 88m -- and people are coming in policing people for being petty (not that anyone should be doing that in the first place).

Ang take ko lang, karamihan nung mga kwento mukhang abusive and toxic ang relationships bago sila nagpasya na magcut-off. Laging inuutangan pala, sobrang dependent sa kanila, tinitiis pala nila yung verbal at emotional abuse -- tapos ngayon, the election revealed a fundamental non-negotiable for them and they honored it. Their resentment, disappointment peaked and they finally realized they supported people with the wrong values. Kaya proud ako makakita nung mga post na nagcucut-off ng toxic family member -- kasi napakahirap niyan sa mga pinoy. 

Dysfunctional ang codependent relationships, at parehong toxic yung behavior ng giver at taker. Unsustainable helping does no favor for both parties, it just deepens the dysfunction--the giver ignores the agency of the other party, gets an ego boost (kasi nga masaya naman tumulong) and the taker never learns to do anything for themselves. Pero sa mga pinoy, they dont see anything wrong with that or they dont see it.

Keeping the peace in ALL relationships is so toxic and also impossible w/o chipping away at you. I'm happy for those who have learned how to set their boundaries in the midst of all this, including myself and our family.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/uo569m/it_was_not_just_because_of_who_they_voted_for_it/,t2_6k8u4ji8,2022-05-13 00:35:18,40
"Philippine lawyers of reddit, pls help me","TW: blackmail and possible emotional abuse

EDIT: Thanks so much guys. After reading all the comments and knowing that there isn't anything he can use against me and all the info you put in, i finally, FINALLY got my ex to leave me alone without ""getting revenge"" or blackmailing me. He is now blocked and I feel so much better now. 

Hi! So my situation is that my emotionally abusive ex boyfriend doesn't want to leave me alone. He's a Filipino, I'm a foreigner from America currently on a student visa and going to college. My family didn't know that we were together. I've tried to leave him but every time I do he threatens to send my nudes to my family. He's in a lot of debt. He was in an accident in 2017 and he owes the doctor, hospital money for the hospital bills and owes a lot of friends a lot of money without any intention of paying them back. Instead he hides in the mountains or at a friends place. I had told him before that I will help him, but i never signed anything. He financially sucked me dry and continued to borrow from people and keeps begging me for more money. He guilt trips me often to try to get more money from me. I am no longer giving him money as I am now saving up for myself. He is now pretty suicidal and said that if he dies or go to jail he will get revenge on me and have my family hate me. I have ignored him on messenger. I'm scared to block him in case he decides to send my nudes. 

Based on what's stated above, is there anything that he can use against me that can land me in jail or deport me? And is there anything I can do to stop all he's doing without my family knowing?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/htiw7u/philippine_lawyers_of_reddit_pls_help_me/,t2_3ucnosxn,2020-07-18 23:57:44,12

How can I leave my Toxic Filipino Grandparents,"I'm a (19M) Still living with my Grandparents along with my former OFW mother we both suffer from Epilepsy and  I'm still in College while my mother is looking for work here back at home but as times continued to go as usual I continue to realize how equally bad my Grandparents are.

Firstly my Grandmother, as best I can describe her without getting angry is that she's incompetent she has always spent every single dime in her personal and money that has been given out to her into the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Lottery and she has done this for a while, even though she technically is a victim of my Grandfather's older rage fits she too has done horrible acts especially on me and also has disregarded her health aswell

Some of the deplorable acts

-Attempted to Abandon me multiples times during my Middle School years 

-Used me as her Courier for PCSO Branches even before I turned 18

-Gave me Capital Punishment so awful that had caused me to gain axiety attacks

-disregarded me being bullied for 2 whole years 

Lastly the biggest one is my Grandfather he's the on that has emotionally and attempted to financially abuse us for years and all we could do was either suck it up and take it in.

His Rage Impulses have always caused huge amounts of stress within the family and anything you either try to say or do causes great amounts of anxiety which my mother also started to develop anxiety attacks too the multiple medical operations and semi-narcissitic attitude along with the emotional and financial abuse and as of writing this he just basically called my Mom a Dead Weight and Donya as an insult when she's already struggling to find a decent job and trying to find a welcoming atmosphere at home because of how bad our grandparents made the home environment feel like a cesspool of bad vibes and petty grudges

Edit: I forgot to mention My Grandfather wouldn't care if I killed myself either and that he'd throw my body in a river for good measure",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/zaosuw/how_can_i_leave_my_toxic_filipino_grandparents/,t2_1b6g2mv9,2022-12-02 23:16:36,4

Can you legally change your surname due to family estrangement?,"My friend recently cut himself off from his family after enduring more than 2 decades of constant abuse (mental, emotional, and physical).

He's decided to start a completely new chapter of his life without them, and even went so far as to proclaim that he doesn't recognize his parents as his parents anymore.

He wants to change his surname to reflect this change, as he doesn't want to have any more ties holding him to his former family.

Is this legally possible in the Philippines? Has anyone done this and can share the experience?

PS. please don't suggest trying to mend things with his family, or going to counseling or therapy. They've tried that multiple times over the years already. It didn't work for them, and even after trying so hard to mend things with his family, he still ended up bruised and bleeding ,sometimes with broken body parts (I say body parts and not bones because his father actually damaged his eye already), c/o his father and/or mother.

Abuse as a grounds for annulment,"Hi everyone. I made this account so I could ask a question.

Is abuse (verbal, emotional, psychological, minimal physical but with threats of harm) grounds for annulment?

I'm a married man, and the pandemic has shown my wife's true colors. She barely does anything with regard to the house's upkeep. I always do the cooking, cleaning, paying the bills, going down for deliveries, etc.; basically the physical work. Whatever she needs I always try my best to provide. 

I guess as the man of the house these are my responsibilities, but whenever I make a mistake, whether minor or major, I am severely berated and insulted. I've been called stupid, useless, and everything in between. I've had bottles thrown at me, been threatened with violence, and have been hit, most times are just strong slaps on my shoulder, but there was this one time she hit me really hard on the back head, open palmed. 

I also have a lot of responsibilities at work, and she doesnt seem to recognize that. There are times that I needed to excuse myself from meetings, file emergency leaves just to attend to her needs.

I'm not sure what to do with my situation. I have pointed out her lack of patience a several times and it doesnt change. I can be forgetful yes, but I'm literally doing so many things. How am I expected to remember every little detail. 

Is this abuse? Am I in an abusive relationship? I'm not sure really. I make mistakes but do I deserve to be berated and insulted, and even hit? All I ever did to react was raise my voice, and she even uses that against me. I've been googling about annulment in here, the process is complicated and expensive, but if the above can be grounds for it, I'll make the investment. 

I really need help on this one. If there are communities online for this kind of thing, or organizations I can turn to for help, please do let me know. Thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/k90vcl/abuse_as_a_grounds_for_annulment/,t2_97z0uooi,2020-12-08 16:52:58,16
Raffy tulfo is the peak of all filipino toxic mentality,"Tulfo's show revolves around bombarding one party with threats, embarrassing them publicly, and encouraging netizens to attack them. In some cases, it is understood that this is a good method if its rich vs. poor, or the other party is someone who is in power. 

However, there is still a proper forum and venue for every complaints. Even he knows this, because he refers family fights to their respective barangays, but not before judging and concluding for himself who's right and wrong, humiliating the person he deemed wrong,  then claiming he's being fair because he lets them talk (only with too much interruption from him saying they're wrong). As if this is still not enough humiliation already, netizens will also say a lot of bad things to that party, even causing one guest to commit suicide. 

Family issues should also be communicated within the family, especially if its between parents and children. Tulfo, however, always sides with the parents, barely listening to the children's side, and emphasizes things like utang-na-loob and blind consideration because ""whatever happens, that is still your parent"". He encourages the mentality of making your kids an insurance policy. It doesn't matter if you can't afford it, it's okay to have ten kids, after all once you're done with the eldest, he/she is the one who's going to shoulder all the responsibilities for the other nine. If you don't give something to your parents (whatever valid reason you may have), you will be labeled as a bad son/daughter, when in the first place, giving should be something out of love, not obligation. 

Another toxic mentality he encourages is keeping a family whole even if its no longer healthy. If Party 1 cheated and Party 2 doesn't want to accept them anymore (perfectly understandable), Tulfo will conclude that Party 2 is the one destroying their family because ""even God forgives, why shouldnt you?"", and ""for the sake of the children"". Will it be healthier tho, for the children to see and hear their parents always fighting and not happy because they're forced to be together? The only abuse he sees is physical. If you're being abused mentally or emotionally, its as good as nonexistent. 

Tulfo's ""fairness"" also includes victim blaming. To be ""fair"" he's also going to enumerate the victim's ""katangahan"". You got molested by your friend? Then you shouldn't have worn skimpy shorts. You got molested by your boss? Maybe because you wanted to have the easy way out. He cheated on you? You must be a nagger, or maybe you don't give him what he wants. Being a victim means there is also something wrong with you too.

I appreciate Tulfo's help for the poor. Giving out personal help for those in need deserves a compliment. Let's not take it away from him. However, him being an almost perfect representation of a ""filipino boomer"" is far from being commendable. He may have the heart, but his sense of justice (attacking a person's dignity) is simply flawed.

Hindi ko na po alam ang gagawin. Tulungan nyo po ako.,"Piling ko po inaabuso na ako sa bahay. Gusto ko nang mamatay. Takot lang sa hindi ko alam na kalalagyan natin sa kabilang buhay. 19 na ako, legal age. Kasi simula nung mga elementary pa ako, ganon na sila. Lalo na ang nanay. Kapag nagagalit, salita ng salita. Kaya kong tumanggap ng mararahas na salita pero sobra na ito. Buong buhay ko nang ganon sya. Para bang pinagbubuntungan nya lang ako, lalo na ngayon kasi nagkaaway kami. Tapos simpleng meeting lang para sa online class kanina, nagagalit sya, pangdemonyo daw, anong kalokohan yun? Di na ako makakilos ng maayos, gusto ko nang magbigti. Parang kasalanan ko pang pinanganak ako. Tapos napansin ko dati, nagdadaldal sya like usual, tapos parang merob atang dumating na online order sa kakilala nya. Biglang nagiba tono nya. Hipokrita pa. Pag sya ang naninigaw pwede, pero pag ako na hindi. May emosyon din ako, pero parang wala syang paje. Parang gusto nya ng robot, hindi ng anak. Gusto ng trophy. Lagi din kinukumpara sa iba. Tapos more recently, bumili ako ng laser na pangilaw, panglaro sa aso namin. Lumabas ako, malapit yubg aso sakin, nililingas ko, may sinabi syang sonething like ""sige sunggaban ka nyan/kagatin ka nyan."" Parang gusto nya akong masaktan. Pansin ko na lagi syang ""sige, ganto ganyan mapapatay ka/sa preso marerape ka."" Parang natutuwa pa syang isipin yun. Tapos hanggang ngayon, hindi pa din tumitigil. Nagsasabi din sya ng mga bagay like ""walang makikinig sayo, pag nagsumbong ka, tiwarik sayo"" ""hindi ka na bata, walang kakampi sayo (alam ko yun, pero ganon na sya nung bata pa ako, pero ignore lang sya)"". Tapos ako pa daw ang masama. Hindi ko na po alam ang gagawin. Yung tatay ko naman talagang walamg pake. Ginaganon na ako cp pa ng cp, tapos ako ang sinasabihan na ""ah wag dapat pagcellphonin yan"". Kampi pa sya, kahit kalma akong nangangatwiran sinisigawan nya ako na tumahimik daw. Nagsasabi din po sila ng mga bagay katulad ng ""ang batas na sinusunod namin batas ng dyos."" Kasi sinabihan ko isang beses yung nanay ko na mental/emotional abuse sya. Ako po ba ang mali? Para naman kasing nanggogoyo eh. Mali po ba ako kasi 19 na ako?

Any kind hearts here to help me seek help for my mental health?,"Since last night, I've been having it hard. I feel trapped. I have no job because I am prevented to take a job for the past decade. This is because my parents applied for immigration and the only way they can successfully apply in the family category is if they can claim me as completely financially dependent. I went through a severe depression phase from 2011 to 2013 after the death of two elder loved ones and my own rare illness that prevented me to continue my studies and life in general. By the grace of God, I recovered from this autoimmune illness quite fast. I only suffered for a year. But something in me snapped in that year. 2011. The worst year of my life. My mental health continued to improve since June 2013. I went to a school counselor because it was required since my grades were failing. I appreciate that rule by the school. To be fair, I was already feeling better that time but the counselling helped me somehow get even better. So I'd like to think I've slowly beaten depression by then.

But here is my story.
I live at my deceased gradparents' house. I live with one aunt and 2 uncles. My aunt is very negative. All I hear from her all day is negativity and problems. She is also a highly-functioning autistic. And despite these things, I can see that she sincerely cares for me despite her limited self. I appreciate and love her for that. My other uncle is okay. He could use some leadership and balls but I also have love for him since he has been kind to me and my family. Now my other uncle is the biggest problem. He is a drug-addicted, violent, abusive, destructive sociopath. He's physically hurt my mom, their eldest brother, my aunt, my 2 cousins.. and me.
I can't remember how many times we have argued that led him to turn violent. He beats me up, verbally attacks me, destroy things and pointed knives at me on two occasions. There was also a time he attacked me and my mom when she was still here in the country. My aunt and other uncle are also somehow afraid of him. They have tolerated his behavior for the longest time. I also think they feel helpless. For this reason, I try to be distant and not talk to this uncle of mine as much as possible. There is quite a distance between him and us. He's done many traumatic things. He was also to blame for my grandmother's death. He has a very destructive behavior and he doesn't show complex emotions. Only anger and laughter. 

He also does things that inconvenienced me. And when I confront him for these abusive things he does, he turns physically violent and destructive.

Our family's application to the foreign country has been granted. This is also one of the things that has been bothering me for a few months now. I can't imagine living in another country without my longtime friends who are my support system that allowed me to pull through and cope. My parents also expect me to always agree with their choices.

This hurts to confess online:
My parents were physically and emotionally abusive. This has improved through time but I still can't get over their neglect when I was a child. I was forced to live with relatives who were cold to me because they kind of hated them and their lifestyle. I had to endure their insults, verbal abuse, unfair treatment and passive-aggressive comments just because they felt that my parents were neglectful and dependent on them. All those times, my grandparent was the only person I clinged onto. That grandparent of mine has died in 2011. I did not take it very well that time.

I am very anxious. I don't want to live in another country. I don't want to be forced to do things anymore. I want some distance from my parents since our relationship works best that way. I also feel that living with them after a long time will just open a can of worms. Something that won't help my mental and emotional well-being at all. They expect me to be something I'm not. They expect me to want the same things they do. They expect me to live life the way they want me to. They are always dismissive. I have to constantly watch how I act and talk in front of them to please them. I'm so tired of putting on a mask and acting in a role. The ""I'm okay"" and ""I will do what you want"" role. My spirit is crushed. My mind is exhausted.

But the problem is I don't know a way out. I have been financially dependent to them. And out of conscience, I agreed to the immigration application because I want them to fulfill their decade-long dream. But that isn't my dream. That isn't the life I want. I just want to be set free.

Everytime I open up my feelings and share my thoughts to my parents, I am dismissed and scolded. I constantly feel guilty for feeling the way I feel. I feel guilty when I'm happy. I feel guilty when I'm sad. I feel guilty when I'm angry. I feel guilty when I'm in love. I feel guilty when I'm depressed.

I am confused. Over the edge. Having suicidal thoughts. Afraid that I'm back to major depression which I dread. I hate it. I don't want to feel that bad again. A feeling I cannot get out of. Feelings of hopelessness, uselessness and dead end.

Last night, I have been on google searching for painless ways to end my life.

I feel that I have a lot to offer if I am given the chance. If I will be given support, understanding, patience and freedom for my own choices.

TLDR; My life has led me to feel suicidal. I want to die because I think it's the easiest way out. But I'm also afraid of hurting myself. I'm afraid of causing pain to those who truly love me. I'm afraid of having an unsuccessful attempt and living the rest of my life suffering its consequences. That will really suck even harder. I don't want to hurt myself and cause inconvenience to other people. I have wonderful friends but I'm afraid of being a burden to them. I need help. Please.

Bakit maraming kabataan ang natatakot na magsabi sa magulang,"A lot of therapists or guidance counselors always say na seek help from their parents or relatives which is fine pero di subjective eh parang sa pang kalahatan yung situation pero may mga magulang kasi na pag sinabihan mo ng problem mo eh kukudaan ka ng kukudaan, kuda dito kuda doon, sisi dito sisi doon eh di naman nasosulutionan yung problem ng anak nila and it leads to them finding someone na mapag sasabihan nila ng problems like someone who experienced it too or anyone who will hear them pero sometimes yung mga tao nayon is iba yung pananaw nila sa problem may bring alot of negativity to you and probably worsen the situation and sometimes those people are never help at all and may try to bring you into the bottom and may pressure you to do bad things. Or if someone have problems and never find people to share his/her problems it leads to overthinking and may worsen the situation and lead to depression, anxiety or even suicide.

Toxic filipino mom (pagod na ko),"Pagod na ko. 20 years old na ko and di ko alam if normal ba na diktahan buhay ko ultimo trabaho ko gusto nila diktahan. Yung pagiging family oriented nila yung nagpapabuo ng galet sakin dahil nassuffocate and nasasakal na ko sa Nanay ko.

Ayaw ako pagtrabahuhin halos lahat


Kada pinopoint out ko pagkakamali sa kanya, nagpapavictim siya sa mga kapatid ko kesyo na bastos at palasagot daw ako. Samantalang siya halos bastusin at insultuhin at mura murahin buong pagkatao ko sa araw araw at pinapahiya ako.

Ewan ko. Kung valid ba tong narramdaman ko dahil nagkakaroon na ko ng grudge at hatred towards her. 

Kung sasabihin man na komprontahin siya? Di siya makikinig. Sasabihan lang ako niyan na ""baket ano na ba narating mo"" favorite niya ipoint out yung mga bagay na obligasyon naman ng isang magulang.

Sometimes naiisip ko ng maglayas at hindi na sila balikan dahil sirang sira na mental health ko. Ilan taon na ko nakakaranas ng mental, emotional, and verbal abuse galing sa Nanay ko. Nakakasuffocate na sobra :)

Kaso habang nasa bahay ako feeling ko mababaliw na ko at sunod sunod na anxiety attacks ko dahil paulit ulit nag fflashback sa utak ko lahat ng mga sinasabi niya saken na hindi magaganda.

Lahat na ata ng klase nang toxic traits sa filipino asian mom, sinalo niya na

"""Anak ka lang. Tatay mo ako.""","It's one of those sentences that our parents say that I personally hate. My dad is verbally abusive towards us. He shouts and curses on us. He calls us names like 'tanga', 'bobo', and the likes. He's a definite control freak. Even when I'm already 24 years old (working male and paying my own bills), he told me that I should never accept an overnight outing with my friends on the weekends because he 'needs' me in the house on weekends.

Anyway, he tries to rule with an iron fist and every time any of my siblings try to reason out with him, he says ""Anak ka lang. Tatay mo ako.""

I personally think that being a father doesn't make you a species above anyone else. In a family, we only have designated roles. A father provides and guides the children. Nowadays, moms provide, nourish, and guide the children too. Children then should help their parents with what they can do, grow up and have their own family and teach the lessons they have learned to them.

Being a parent doesn't mean that you deserve 'better' respect than your kids. In the eyes of God (no offense to atheists), we are all created equal. We only have roles and paths to take in this world but you are not better nor lesser than anyone. Of course we should never shout at our parents. That's plain disrespect. But even as simple as reasoning out your right to decide what's best for your life, they tell you ""Anak ka lang. Tatay mo ako.""

At one point we argued because my sister told my grandmother that dad was being too controlling. My dad said ""Kung hindi ko kinontrol yan, matagal ng puta ang apo mo! (If I don't control her, she would have been a whore for a long time!)"" It got on my nerves because my sister doesn't go out to socialize much. It's just school-home every week.

I told him that what he said is bad. Then of course he scolded on me, cursed me, and again ""Anak ka lang. Tatay mo ako.""

He tells me, ""Pag nagkaanak ka, maiintindihan mo sinasabi ko."" I don't have a family of my own yet, but I don't have to have kids to know that his way of parenting is wrong. That he is verbally abusive and that his ways strips us of our liberty.

It's been like this for a long time. He tells me to not talk back. Of course, as much as I can, I don't talk back. There are times though that I shout back because as a human being, I can only hold so much. ""Tao lang, nasasaktan din"".

But all these years of emotional suppression led me to develop hatred towards him. I know its wrong to hate your parents, but it's the inevitable outcome of trying to suppress your feelings ""kasi anak lang ako at tatay ko siya.""

(Help) My friend's girlfriend is being abused and we need advice,"I have a friend/classmate who has a girlfriend, who we're gonna refer to as Jane. They are both helping each other out in their problems but Jane is also a victim of abuse and we're trying to go the right step in getting help and to keep her safe.

Jane is sexually and emotionally abused and her mother and stepfather do not care about her. Jane has been raped by her uncle during a reunion doon sa probinsya ng nanay niya. They were supposed to go there again this New Year but she didn't come and came to my friend to talk about it to his parents (more on that later). Her mom wouldn't listen and disregards it and her uncle continues. Jane's also been getting thin these past few months. Her drunk cousin also raped her in a separate occasion. She also has a sister who's separated from her parents but makes up stories and once sued their mother and won. She's also not to be trusted and she also doesn't care about Jane and she is manipulative.

At the same time Jane also has an ex (lesbian/tomboy) who threatens to commit suicide if she doesn't stay with her. There were times when my friend got punched/slapped by her ex but my friend didn't fight back. Both of them and my friend are depressed and have thought about suicide but to calm things down Jane agreed to stay with her for a while. However her ex became too controlling and threathened to hurt my friend and she also made suicidal threats and is trying to break them up. Her ex also blackmailed him and hacked his Facebook and sent numerous messages but fortunately we got it back. Jane and her ex are both in the same school while me and my friend are in a different one.

My friend brought her to his parents and told them what she's been through and still going through. They had a talk about her family, her ex, and the abuse. They now provide her school allowance and sleep in her classmate's house and are planning to report them but it would need to take time and resources to demand them in court. But so far they are going to lay low and take some time for now.

Should I take family and friends to watch Katips? No spoiler review.,"Should I take family or friends to watch Katips? A non spoiler review.

I watched this with a few redditors last night in Megamall, probably the theater is 70% filled. How about the ""other"" film? I can't tell because it's showing right next to Minions and Thor, so families could be flocking there. 

So I'll cut this short. It is good? Definitely better than the average Filipino film. Is it similar to western musical movies like Les Miserables? Don't expect you'll get grand sets and impressive visuals like that. Regardless of it's greatness and flaws, the most valuable thing in it is that it depicts a piece of history that we shouldn't forget or dismiss. 

**What is really good**: The music and the performances of the actors. The songs are catchy and memorable. Acting definitely deserve all the awards. If you think Mon Confiado was peak douche in *General Luna*, that was just his family friendly version. Other actors (sorry I can't remember their names) also shined especially in intense singing and heavy scenes. 

There's a lot of heart and humor so the audience can be attached to the characters, making some of the events more emotional for the audience. 

The film focuses on the little, invisible people rather than glorify specific heroes or big names in politics. 

**The weakness:** It's directly lifted from the musical format that it's straightforward ""tell not show"". There's a lot of scenes where historical events happen without visuals, and the characters just talk about it. 

I also feel that some subplot, particularly romance and characterization need some rewriting to align them to cinema standards. Some scenes transition are also massive mood whiplash due to the editing similar to the transitions in a musical. 

**The Warning/Exercise Caution**

It's R-16, and while I didn't bother to check the trailer because I wanted to see it blind, there's a lot of violence and upsetting visuals. It's potentially triggering as well due to the abuse inflicted on some characters. 

**Will the movie be effective in educating others or possibly converting fanatics to see the truth?**

**For moderates, could be an eye opener, for fanatics, it could be mixed results at best.**

The movie relies on the audience to have prior knowledge of the events in the 1970s. If you're already a sympathizer to social movements, then connection to the characters would be easier. 

**However, assuming you have little or no historical knowledge, especially the fanatical ones, they might not be that sympathetic with the characters and see them as radical, noisy, mobs who deserve to be disciplined.**

The main characters cry violation human rights, American neo-imperialism, and dictatorship, which are all big concepts. **But unless the audience sees them visually, or able to relate them to their daily lives, and understand why they should care about those issues, they might not see the actions of the protagonists as noble and selfless.**

It's also possible the audience might sympathize with the activists, but blame the cruelty on soldiers/cops than the Marcos family. 

The film uses romance as a shortcut to humanize the characters, and possibly to appeal to a specific demographic. Personally, it's mixed results due to some bad dialogue (and cringeworthy in some parts). However, if it worked with others, then it's good. 

Hence, when some characters are subjected to horrible things, the emotional attachment and visual horror might help open the eyes of the audience. 

Overall:

I wish it has a bigger budget to have more visual scenes rather than rely on dialogue and direct from musical format. But that's why we should talk with our wallet. Perhaps the film being made for the 50th anniversary will be grander. 

Please support the film! Hope this review helps consider who you should bring.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/wfnhtn/should_i_take_family_and_friends_to_watch_katips/,t2_52wyps5,2022-08-04 08:59:54,68

[Serious] How do I report my ex-boyfriend for physically hurting me?,"My relationship with my boyfriend wasn't good from the start. It was emotionally abusive at first, and sooner it lead to punching me at one point and left large bruises on my arm, face and popped my lips (this was a year ago). I asked helped from his mom and she told me to break up with him for a moment to let things cool down, but I was stupid and so blind, I did not listen to her.

Last night we went drinking with one of his friends. We woke up this morning and while hangover, he started a conversation about my personal issues. I'm very depressed lately, and things weren't going so good in my life. He started taunting me, then making fun of my depression, then started telling me things like I should kill myself because I'm just a burden for my family, his life and my friends. I told him to be quiet but he would never stop. This went on for full fifteen minutes. I got tired, so I just put my earphones on so I won't hear him anymore.

I was laying on the bed. He then kicked me on my thigh. I told him what the hell was wrong with him, and he took his desk chair and threatened to throw it to me. This made me so mad I shouted and slapped him on the face. He punched me on my left hip, then stomach. I shouted at the door so his mother could hear me. ""Your son is physically hurting me!"" I opened the door and let his mother in, I told her what he did to me and she helped me get out of the room. She told me I should report him to the police and advised me that I should take a break from seeing him, which I would gladly now do so.

Advice Po,"18yrs old po and seeking advice on family problems, my mother is a single mom at hindi naman sya emotionally or mentally abusive palagi. Pero mahilig sumigaw at magalit sa mga maliliit na bagay. (maling pagbubukas ng yelo kailangan ko iready sarili ko)

Normally hahayaan ko sya mag vent but it's got to the point where na palagi ako stressed pag nsa bahay siya at kailangan ko mag tiptoe kung ano yung sasabihin ko. 

Alam ko naman yan yung mga bagay kailangan natin tiisin sa buhay pero gusto nya rin sabihin ko lahat ng bagay nangyayari. Ok naman yan pero as i said she likes to blow things out of proportion and from experience ginagamit niya mga sinasabi ko as ammunition in an argument. 

In short I love her but I don't always trust her, 

Yung problema is hindi nya matangap yan, i tried to tell her wag palagi ganyan mag react or mag sisinungaling talaga ako minsan. Pero sinabi niya rin eh ganyan talaga siya at wala makikitang mali sa ginagawa.

I've resorted to using a suicide hotline weekly para hindi ma stress at mag lash out sa ibang tao. I can't risk informing extended family dahil baka madala rin sila.

Alam na natin kung gaano kalala ang problema sa sistema at mas lalo pa nating naramdaman sa election na ito. Ngayon, ang tanging paraan para makamit ang inaasam nating magandang Pilipinas ay ipagpatuloy ang laban.

>Ang namulat ay hindi na muling pipikit

Sana'y patuloy nating i-educate ang mga tao kung ano ang tama at mali, ano ang good governance na gusto nating makamit. Paano gumagana ang ekonomiya at paano mag isip para sa sarili. Paano malaman ang fake news at hindi.

Labanan natin ang kakulangan sa edukasyon ng mga tao na dulot ng pagbabawas ng gobyerno sa budget ng edukasyon.

At nais ko rin sanang isapuso natin hindi lang ngayong election kundi sa buhay natin ang ""**Radikal ang Magmahal.**"" Gawin natin itong main driver para sa pagbabago sa bulok na sistema ng Pilipinas.

Tulad na lamang ng kung paano nabago ng Black community, sa pamumuno ni Martin Luther King Jr., ang sistema, gamitin natin ang pagmamahal para baguhin ang pananaw ng lahat. (I implore everyone to take time to read the black social movement)

Let's make this moment a social movement sa pagbabago sa bulok na sistema. Isapuso natin ang values at gawing habits ang mga natutunan natin ngayong election.

**Wag nating susukuan ang mahal nating Pilipinas,**

[RANT] Let's address the 'elephant in the room',"**[TL;DR]**: Sometimes, we agree so much on politics that it already becomes a circlejerk. While that’s often fine and all, I’ve noticed that this is where we usually begin and end our agreements. When it comes to other social issues, most especially women’s rights, we tend to be somewhat “divided.”

---------------------------------------------------

**Inb4 “Feminazi”** - Not sure about some, but I’m pretty sure I know what a Feminazi is, and I haven’t seen one here on /r/ph go to that level (yet). Napaka-MILD ng discussions dito to even accuse someone here of that. To be fair, I personally detest the ‘feminazism’ I sometimes see from Western countries. I’m a feminist (male) and I hate them for being irrational SJWs that usually turn to misandry.

---------------------------------------------------

I’ve been frequenting /r/ph for a while and when I first got here, I was really amused of having like-minded folks. This became my ‘safe zone’ where I can express myself without appearing whiney as I supposed people think of me on Facebook. I’m pretty sure the same applies to most of us here; a better discussion thread where we can have educated debates over serious matters, and minimize ad hominems to produce fruitful discussions.

There’s just one thing I’ve noticed though. (I’m not sure if it’s because there are more redditors now (100k+), or it’s just really the majority of thoughts that you’d expect from probably a male-dominated thread) It’s nice when we talk about politics, sure. Sometimes, we agree so much that it already becomes a circlejerk. While that’s often fine and all, I’ve noticed that this is where we usually begin and end our consensus agreements. When it comes to other social issues, most especially women’s rights, we tend to be somewhat “divided.” I’m not saying we should all agree on one thing, but I just noticed that when discussions go towards that path, it seems that men here get easily triggered.

For instance, when discussions go about career-oriented stuff, we all have a general consensus on it. But when it goes specifically about say, the catcalling law, the [120-day maternity leave](https://redd.it/5xtbp6), [abortion](https://redd.it/5yy86w), [prostitution](https://redd.it/5u7rlp), et al, some of us tend to be so affected by it that they immediately point out the “possible” negative towards society. It’s also kind of amusing that most vocal people here happen to be men. Sometimes, they’d make a statement like they are speaking on behalf of women. So far, I haven’t read much comments from actual women about these issues who would actually give their two cents on the matter.

Just to give you a gist:

* Catcalling law - comments went on with ‘this is prone to abuse’ without actually reading the bill. (I can no longer find that thread as I’ve deleted it since discussions were becoming toxic instead of fruitful -- and most who commented were very triggered 'men')

* [120-Day Maternity](https://redd.it/5xtbp6) - comments immediately went on saying this will be a possible turning point of employers to not employ females (without even reading the article that fathers will also benefit from it extending their Paternity Leaves from 7 to 30 days). Someone even shared a ‘study’ that says it would lead to overpopulation, when upon reading the entire paper, it was non-conclusive.

* [Abortion](https://redd.it/5yy86w) - some seem to get emotional to the point that this subreddit is being accused of being “TOO LEFT” for them. Hey, the argument of a fetus being a human being is still subject for debate within the scientific community. Also, again. Some made statements like the girl involve has no right to decide for herself. Some bring up the “moral” card when that alone is as subjective as how we’d all agree on the essence of religion.

* [Prostitution](https://redd.it/5u7rlp) - Ah, yes. The thread kind of missed the point of legalizing it. It was meant to reduce possible human trafficking, and properly regulate sex workers to prevent STDs and give them rights to call out rape if clients tend to become abusive and forceful. Some even called them the demeaning term of ‘pok pok’ in an emotional manner which led to another discussion of ‘morality.’

This subreddit becomes toxic quick when these topics are brought up. The sexism and misogyny is apparent once these ones are on the table. While I do not expect everyone to agree on everything, I don’t know why some ph redditors become highly triggered and would resort to ad hominems and angered statements instead of an educated fruitful discussion. It’s not healthy. That’s one of the reasons why we all went here from Facebook, right?

Can I file a case against my father for adultery?,"Throwaway account.

&#x200B;

I'm 32 and I have three other siblings. One is 25, other is 23 and the youngest is 9 years old. We recently found out our dad is having an affair. At first, we were just plainly troubled as according to my mom ""matagal na siyang ganyan but nothing serious"". But now, things are getting out of hand.

Long story, short - my dad and mom are still together BUT their arrangement is that my father is going to stay at his kerida for the weekends. Mother is being verbally and emotionally abused and I can feel like my younger sibling is being traumatized. I have my own place and family but the rest of my family is staying at home. Two older siblings are not on speaking terms with father. We already talked to our mom and she doesn't want to do anything about it. Mainly because she is so in love with my dad and can't live without him. We're so frustrated. Dad expressed he wants to leave Mom and start a new family but Mom wouldn't let him go. We also full like he doesn't want to fully let go either because Mom does everything for him. She's like a servant and wasting away her golden years for this disgusting man.

Recently, we obtained pictures of our dad with the kerida. It's graphic, nudes and even have videos. I won't discuss the details of how we got it but we have it. It's Hayden Kho level of nudes, showing they are at the motel with their faces showing. It's disgusting. Worst, we found out the girl is 30 and they've been together for 6 years already. We had really no idea. Six years ago we were at a good place, financially and overall.

We told mom. She acted up for a day or two, tried to threaten dad as well so we thought everything is going to change now. However, as expected, started crawling back to dad after a week. Dad is aware that we know but acts like he's untouchable. We're financially capable without him and I feel like we don't need him in our life. I am just really worried for my younger sibling witnessing all of this and I feel like it's really affecting him psychologically. I keep telling my mom to file for adultery but she won't. I am fed up with her. She only thinks about herself and never about us. My younger brother is suffering and I want to remove him from the situation.

I want my dad to go to jail and file a case against him. He's still going to the kabit during the weekends. Can I do this without my mom's consent? We have the evidence of his concubinage. Pictures, conversations, dates. We have the name, details and address of the other woman.

I am extremely shy and an introvert but I'm willing to go out of my comfort zone to help my mom and siblings. I just find it really disgusting and unacceptable that he has the family for the weekdays and kabit on the weekends and MOM is actually okay with this. She needs to wake up as well.

Any legal advise would be appreciated. Thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/qy1nan/can_i_file_a_case_against_my_father_for_adultery/,t2_gqhk50s3,2021-11-20 16:55:36,20
"Lawyers of Reddit PH, please enlighten us about VAW procedures.","Sample situation: Ana lives with her partner, Juan, who is physically and emotionally violent/abusive towards her. Ana used to stay at her parents house in Old City but is now staying with Juan in New City.  In her official records, she lives in Old City. She also stays there sometimes. Ana experienced violence in their home. 

Whenever I go to different offices or organizations, I get different answers. Sometimes, I am being passed from the barangay to the police station and when I get there, they'd ask me to go back to the barangay. No, I'm not Ana. Just helping women like her. 

Could you please enlighten us of us who don't know (and couldn't find the answer on the internet) about the following:

* **Blotter** \- can this be filed in either the barangay or police station? If in the barangay, in which barangay can this be filed - in the place of the incident or Ana's residence, or both? Who can file for this?
* **BPO** \- can this be filed - in the place of the incident or Ana's residence, or both? Who can file for this?
* **Medico - legal certificate** \- Are these offered only in Public Hospitals? Can the victim be accompanied by someone during the check-up and can the hospital/doctor refuse that accompanying person entry? Just wondering in case the victim is uncomfortable being checked on her own. 
* **For all of the above** \- Are the issuances of these dependent on office hours or can they be acquired anytime, especially considering that Ana is at risk for experiencing more violence. 
* If the hospital, police or barangay (or the people in there) do not do what they are supposed to do considering these crises cases, can they be reported and where?

Searching for a Tagalog drama from the 90s,"Im trying to find a sad movie from the 90s. It’s about a young family gets torn apart by tragedy. The Father is killed by thugs. Mother loses her mind and wonders in the street. The young Children are left to the care of their Grandmother who unexpectedly dies in a rocking chair. They are soon orphaned by their Uncle and aunt who abuse them and treat them like slaves. Later in the movie, the Mother who appears schizophrenic sees a group of hoodlums hanging out outside a sari sari, drinking, eating, having fun. She approaches the men and asks if they could share a puto. One of the men takes sexual advantage of her after giving her the food. She shows no feeling and emotion and continues to eat while he is kissing her. Later she reunites with the children but she can no longer remember them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/kpw401/searching_for_a_tagalog_drama_from_the_90s/,t2_wdnao,2021-01-04 07:45:44,6
Move Out or Not?," Hi! I am a 21 (almost) Filipina. I'm kind of stuck being in a cycle. Due to the pandemic, I stopped going to school for a year and continued my work as a Call Center Agent with a more or less 20k pay monthly. Now, I got accepted to a free University to continue my studies.

I'm really stuck between staying in this house with my relatives or not because I am mentally so exhausted. My father is mentally and physically abusive to my mom and I see that almost everyday and I cannot do anything about it because everyone in this house thinks it's my mom's fault. My relatives who I am staying with are anti-social and I'm mentally drained. They are gaslighters as well. "" We took care of you so you should take care of us "" or "" You should be the one buying food since you are the one with a salary (none of them in the house is working and are depending on my aunt and uncle in the states). My mom is the only person who lets me be me and accepts me fully.

I feel so depressed living in this house and I always think of moving out. When I stayed by myself for a week ( not ran away from home cause I was 20 when this happened and they told me to return home to help with the homework of my cousin) I felt so alive and free and at peace with myself.

I really don't know what to do. Maybe I just need someone to talk to. I'm just so tired. I know people out there have it harder than me, but what else am I getting up for? I am mentally and emotionally drained. If I move out, I might have a difficult time juggling school, work and bills. If I stay, I can already guess that my mind and heart will have to suffer for a long time.

It's really a long story but this is the gist of it.

If anyone can give me an advice, that would be helpful. Thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/odgzj5/move_out_or_not/,t2_7qa1z6kl,2021-07-04 17:27:06,35
Im planning to run away from home...,"So... Im 16 turning 17 years old this upcoming april and Im planning to run away from home and cut ties with my family... Heres a little background of me....

Im 13 when my father committed suicide... And ever since then things about our family started to fall deep down.... After my father's death my mother's beating stopped for a while, yes, for a while because Im already 15 when i realized that it actually never stopped and that she went to emotional abuse rather than physical, i started to realized it when she went away and become an OFW (abroad) to work, she says its for us (me and my sister) even though she usually complains when she sends money as if she really doesnt want too.... And now things are getting worst and worst while my mom is not here at home my sister which is younger than me, started going out and wont be going back until late night or she'll sneak out at the middle of the night to go to her boyfriend's (which changes every now and then) who basically doesnt even go to school properly, or wont be going home for days and will occasionally be ""running home"" to go to my aunt's who's just a few walks away from the house were staying in. And my relationship with my mom is much more distant than before, she refuses to talk to me and will be ending the call when the phone was passed to me... And will be bad mouthing me on our relatives, they all hate me now, they doesnt even want me to set foot on their house or to see me, she also always blames me on everything, like she blames me that im the reason why she doesnt want to go back ..... And Now, that I am 17 I got enough of it, I want to run away from home and never talk to them ever again, rather than walking the same path as my father did to himself....... Is there any advice you can give me? Someone? Please?

• Im now 16 turning 17 and my sister is now 15 when my mom left im 15 and shes 13..
• Between me and my sister im the only one who is always getting beaten up by her... And my father is the only one who i can lean on and he's only home for 3 months after 9 months of being on ship. (He's a marine/ seaman)... Even a little advice can help.... Im just really in need rightnow....

Edit: I got a little talk with my grandma today... And she slipped an information without me or her bringing up... That my mother practically run away -ed from me.... Well.... Shit I guess...

Outsmarting the Filipino Architects of Disinformation - PH Elections,"**Outsmarting the Architects of Disinformation: A Primer**

Following this election’s turn out that is said to be heavily-influenced by mass distortion of truth, misinformation, negative campaigning and trolling efforts, we must take a stand to fight for truth and real history.

The disinformation machinery behind this is sophisticated. They got the funds, the process, the social media systems, the hierarchy, and people willing to do the dirty job, whether because they are paid, or they truly believe the person (or idea) being marketed. 

Uh-huh. This is not fake news. Just read up the report named **“Architects of Networked Disinformation: Behind the Scenes of Troll Accounts and Fake News Productions in the Philippines”**

https://newtontechfordev.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ARCHITECTS-OF-NETWORKED-DISINFORMATION-FULL-REPORT.pdf

People can be professionals, people looking for part time or side line work, media influencers and ordinary people consumed by social media like Facebook and Tiktok. Unfortunately, we can never identify them in real life. They can use up to 20 social media accounts. They use fake names. Outside of their gruesome work they are our relatives, friends, coworkers, neighbors. This is as per one troll whistleblower who called in Mo Twister’s radio show at Magic 89.9:

*  They have think-tank groups that make up “scripts” or templates to be used in responding / content creation

* They can be paid as high as 60-80 thousand pesos per month

* They dig up old Facebook accounts to be bought, then are then used to post content and comments for the campaign

* They play dumb in their responses or comments to elicit engagement from people

* They do not create fake news – means another group of people does that *ehem* influencers *ehem*

https://interaksyon.philstar.com/trends-spotlights/2022/05/11/217024/troll-farm-workers-radio-caller-salary-campaign/

In short, they are an army. A covert army. Integrated into our society. Infiltrated our psyche. Playing the long game. So subtle we have no idea until the last months leading to the elections. Such effectiveness.

The call now is to fight disinformation and fake news. Truth farms versus troll farms.

It is not easy. Not at all. Seeing them is seeing humanity as almost at its worst online: lies, insults, profanity, gaslighting, name-calling, misdirection, memes, you name it. They have it all. One wrong move and we fall into their traps. We must take a stand. Before that, we must be well-informed:


***SO WHAT IS FAKE NEWS:**

**Fake news** is *false or misleading information presented as news*. Fake news often has the aim of damaging the reputation of a person or entity, or making money through advertising revenue. Some people also claim that truthful stories are ""fake news,"" just because they don't agree with them. This can lead to the dangerous ignoring of vital advice. This is the first weapon of the disinformation machinery.

*Example of news media spouting fake news:*

1. SMNI
2. Manila Times


**HOW TO SPOT FAKE NEWS OR CONTENT:**

Getting the idea from this site, we have at least six ways on how:

1. **Develop a Critical Mindset** 

- Keep emotion in check. Read, hear, watch rationally and critically. Ask questions about it.

2. **Check the Source** 

- Check the web address for the page you're reading. Spelling errors in company names, or strange-sounding extensions like "".infonet"" and "".offer,"" rather than "".com"" or "".co.uk,"". Check if the website or blog is real or fake or doctored or copied. Check if the author or publisher is truly the expert in the topic. Fake news may have no or inactive links, questionable websites where information was taken from, hard to fact-check or would easily fail a fact-check when compared to other news or information.

3. **See Who Else Is Reporting the Story** 

- Has anyone else picked up on the story? What's their take on it? See if the story checks out in reputable news sites or media. Check if these are created by questionable or biased content creators and influencers (they may even be legit influencers before but check their profile and contents and you may see a pattern of contents becoming solely about the person being promoted or being bashed)

4. **Examine the Evidence** 

- A credible news story will include plenty of facts – quotes from experts, survey data and official statistics, for example. Or detailed, consistent and corroborated eye-witness accounts from people on the scene. Fake news usually has no or unreliable source of information provided. Also check if these are created by questionable or biased content creators and influencers who may be promoting one person or idea over the other. The content are also exaggerated, and possibly biased.

5. **Don't Take Images at Face Value**

- Refers to low or questionable quality of graphics and videos (but they are getting more creative!). Photo editing programs are so sophisticated we can barely tell fake or manipulated images or videos from real ones at times. Images and videos can also be 100 percent accurate but used in the wrong context, so check for evidence of image manipulation, photo editing or video splicing.

6. **Check That it ""Sounds Right""**

- Finally, use your common sense or intuition or stored memory! Bear in mind that fake news is designed to ""feed"" your biases, hopes or fears. still, this is only effective when one has an idea or background about the topic. Fake news usually has sensationalized headlines to entrap us (tabloid style, shock value, inciting extreme negative or positive emotion or reaction, depending if ostracizing the enemy or praising the person - product)
 

**HOW TO IDENTIFY A TROLL:**

Here we will have a [link](https://getkidsinternetsafe.com/how-to-spot-an-internet-troll/#:~:text=How%20to%20Spot%20an%20Internet%20Troll%201%20They,They%20are%20likely%20attacking%20more%20than%20one%20account.) to some interesting ideas, but for the sake of the topic, we will make it more applicable to the Philippine setting:

**What are internet trolls?**

An internet troll is someone who makes *intentionally inflammatory, rude, or upsetting statements online to elicit strong emotional responses in viewers or to steer the conversation off-topic.* Internet trolls are easy to spot once you are aware of certain online behavior patterns;

* They usually have newly created account or old accounts that seems suspicious

* They have mostly empty profiles or accounts or few posts.

* They may set their profiles to private.

* They don’t show their own face in their profile image. Instead, they typically use a seemingly “funny” photo of a cartoon character, a celebrity photo, or a random image.

* Their username is a nickname rather than their real name.

* Their education is listed with cheesy, funny or cliché phrases (ex. “Studying at: your heart”

* They are typically following several accounts but have few to no followers themselves.

* They usually have a lot of memes on their profile.

* There often have several offensive and controversial posts or interactions with controversial comments.

* They usually take extreme political or opinion positions on certain issues and repeatedly focus on them.

* They are likely attacking more than one account.

* Once you meet several of them you will see they post similar posts or comments.

* They use these scripts / response templates to provoke responses from others. They also ask incredulous or stupid questions.

* Once you engage with one, several more trolls will swarm you with responses even if you are not responding anymore. They try to isolate and then gaslight the victim. Gaslight means that the abusers make the victims think they did something wrong

* When you are winning the argument, they will resort to name-calling, demeaning nicknames, and insults, or changing the topic and starting the cycle all over again. They use ad hominem attacks or make fun of other people’s bad grammar as a way of shutting down an opponent’s argument. They refuse to back down.

* They may also fake with aggressively poor reading comprehension esp. on your responses that makes perfect sense.


**HOW TO HANDLE FAKE NEWS AND TROLLS:**

There have been many tips shared on how, so let’s categorize them into five:

1.       **Do not engage the person.**

“They (trolls) mention that their ultimate failure as fake account operators on Facebook is when they are called out as a fake account.”

a.       This is the simplest and safest solution. More effective if done by many.

b.       Do not reply to a troll comment or reply. Bore them into disengagement

c.       You can also say something like “I do not feed trolls / Troll spotted.”

d.       React with the appropriate emoticon or reaction icons only.

e.       Avoid sharing or just share to a targeted audience.

2.       **Report the comment / post / profile / account.**

a.       This is the right action if you do not wish to further engage.

b.       Make sure to have checked if the news / post / comment is indeed fake before doing so.

c.       There are websites or apps where you can report fake news or posts. 

                                                             i.      These may ask for links, photo screenshots and timestamp / time and date it happened.

                                                           ii.      For photos, you may be asked to blur person identifiable information of the innocent / those not related to the troll

d.       It helps if you are familiar with the common topics / categories and the process. Usually we use either one type of offence or report several times with different offence depending on the nature of the post.

e.       The Report button can be found on the comment / post / group / profile’s Menu button. It is also referred to as the three-dots, three-horizontal-lines or hamburger icon.

**FACEBOOK:**

1.       Account – 

2.       Post / Comment – Report Post / Report Post to Group Admin > Select a problem > either:

a.       Harassment > Me / Other persons

b.       False Information > Political > Election / Other Political

c.       Hate speech > Something Else

d.       Something Else > Fraud / Scam, Mocking victims, Bullying, Hate Speech

3.       Group:

a.       Harassment or Bullying

b.       False Information > Political > Election / Other Political

c.       Hate speech > Something Else

d.       Spam

**TWITTER:**

1.       Account

a.       It’s suspicious or spam

b.       Their tweets are abusive or harmful

c.       It appears their account is hacked

d.       They’re pretending to me or someone lese

2.       Tweet / Responses

a.       It’s suspicious or spam

b.       It’s abusive or harmful

c.       It’s misleading

 **YOUTUBE:**

1.       Videos

a.       Hateful or abusive content

b.       Harassment or Bullying

c.       Spam or misleading

**TIKTOK:**

1.       Account – go to account profile, select Menu button (three dots), Report (flag) > Report Account (and Content if you want)

2.       Posts – click the share icon / button instead (looks like a curved arrow), click Report button (flag)

a.       Misleading information

b.       Hate Speech

c.       Harassment or Bullying

d.       Spam

e.       Other

3.       **Engage smartly.** Use facts, logic and scripts.

a.       This is the most dangerous as we might get caught up with our emotions, or get targeted. Tread with care. Do as last resort.

b.       Remember to save a copy of your mostly used responses / scripts / photos / links etc. so it is easier for you to leave the message.

c.       You may just comment on the main post with factual information. Provide a simple explanation, in the local language or vernacular if possible. Provide the link. Attach a photo or infographic. Leave at it.

d.       If you dare comment with facts directly to a troll comment, expect a barrage of troll answers, brace yourself with the misinformation. This is where things get ugly. You either stop responding altogether, ignore them and continue posting other factual info to the main post, or answers objectively as possible. You have to draw the line though.

4.       **Troll the trolls.** Use their scripts, your wit, humor and sarcasm.

a.       You may take a lesson from the trolls themselves.

b.       Save their *lovely* scripts. Edit them to suit your narrative or the context. Then use it back. That usually shuts them up.

c.       You can use dry humor and sarcastic responses as well. This can work if they do not understand it, so they think you are with them. If they understand it, then you can switch to playing dumb, using their scripts, etc.

5.       **Go on the offensive. Troll them instead.**

a.       This is the most ballsy move. When you find a post directed at praising the person / item, comment something negative, but factual. If trolls comment, you have your options: Ignore, report, or lay out factual information.

b.       When you find a post that seems to insinuate the person’s shortcomings or negative aspect, comment something that exaggerates that negative aspect.


**SO THAT’S IT?**

Oh no. If you are willing, we can do so much more. If you are into the **Positive Campaigning,** you can:

1.       Share positive posts of the better candidate / person / product.

2.       Like follow / subscribe and share.

3.       React with like or love emoticons.

4.       Comment. Use scripts. Leave correct hashtags.



**OOPS WE FORGOT ABOUT SAFETY FIRST**

We were caught up in the moment that we forgot the basic: social media or online presence safety. Ideally:

1.       Use an alternative account / profile if you are engaging in negative campaigning (trolling the trolls). Close unused profiles.

2.       Beef up the security. Private view, Locked account, Restricted access, the works.

3.       Keep your personal information private, and share personal / intimate posts privately or to selected audience if possible.

4.       Protect yourself from red-tagging. As per Wikipedia, in the Philippines, red-tagging refers to the malicious blacklisting of individuals or organizations critical or not fully supportive of the actions of a sitting government administration in the country. These individuals and organizations are ""tagged"" as either communist or terrorist or both, regardless of their actual political beliefs or affiliations. If you get red-tagged, take evidence like screenshot, and contact your lawyer or reach out to public law practitioners.

"Need advice. I want to file a police report for a Victim of Violence against Women, but the victim and witness are vehemently against","The victim is my grandmother. The witness is my mother. They are afraid that the police won’t do anything and are deeply afraid of retaliation from the abuser. They are so afraid that they are looking at me as if I’ve become the enemy. That I’m just bringin in more trouble. That I can’t defend them if anything goes wrong.

Also, my mom seems to be symphatizing with the guy who has hurt my grandmother. She deems him to be important in our lives m, which I think not, he’s an alcohol addict, a gambler, someone who regularly hurls emotional abuse at me and my grandmother, and has been recently becoming more violent against my grandmother. I think that this is a chance for me to send him to jail. But I’m so afraid. 

Its just the three of us, our other relatives are too afraid to help me. It’s just me all alone and I need support. I can’t get it from my mom and grandma. I want to go to the police, I feel it’s my duty. I’m just so afraid. I want someone to help me. 

We just got back from the Barangay. All I can convince my mom to do is file a blotter report. She and my grandma won’t do anything else. I planned to go to the police but they went hysterical and became angry at me. They say that he’s going to kill us before the police can do anything. My grandma had become pale with panic, grabbing my arm, not letting me go, to calm her down I have no choice but to bring her home. 

I’m sitting here feeling guilty that I feel a little relieve that I can leave that mess behind. But I know that this is not the end of this. My stepdad is an alcoholic addict. He won’t stop drinking, he won’t stop venting his anger at us. He’ll probably become more violent. 

I made a mistake, I should have gone to the police the day he hurt  my grandma. I let a day pass, made my grandma and mother reluctant to take action. That they just want to let the whole thing blow over. I admit, years of abuse had grinded on me. Made me a weakling with no gumption. To take action. I’m a coward. I have depression and I have social anxiety. I’m afraid to get out of the house. I don’t think I’m the right person to save myself and my mom and my grandma. I’m calling for my relatives to help me but they say that this is my problem. They don’t want to get involve. All they say is to go to the police. Is it really that easy?

Edit: The reason we can’t fully trust the police to be able to protect us. If they arrest him, will they let him go a few days later. If they do. It will be like we’ll be sitting ducks against his retaliation. I’m severely lacking from information about what’s going to happen afterwards. This guy was a former NPA terrorist, a police asset, a Korean Mafia vip guard. He used to brag being a killer for hire and killing his ex-wife’s lover in front of her. The tales of the things he did, hunting for his escaping ex-wife. Fortunately for her, she was succesful in her mission to hide her sons and daughter from him. She was much stronger than me.

I can already feel the disgust, distastes my relatives are feeling for me, because of my inaction. My inability to do the right and proper thing. I’m such a shameful human being. 

I’m sorry for making you read all of this. And thanks for all the advice. 

I’m considering, secretly buying a gun. And maybe talking to a lawyer. And next time something happens I’ll go directly to the police.

"Maria Clara and Ibarra: A bulleted commentary on GMA's recently concluded series, inspired by u/ShiroClayGuy's post","Amidst all its flaws, it is the Filipino television series that made me interested in checking out GMA (and PH mainstream entertainment) again. Here are what I think made this show great:

* **Dennis Trillo as Crisostomo Ibarra/Simoun** \- He wasn't called GMA's ""Drama King"" without a reason. Here, with his acting prowess combined with great writing and character wardrobe, he owned these roles very well. I can go on forever on how I adore him in this show, but of course, this shouldn't be a dissertation, eh?
* **Julie Anne San Jose as Maria Clara** \- I knew little of Julie Anne's acting works before this show (I haven't watched TV for years, not even GMA dramas), so seeing her do so well in so many aspects just earned my respect for her. Not only she is an undeniable match for Maria Clara's supposed beauty and immaculate voice, but she also shows excellence in delivering lines both in Filipino and Spanish and has a wide range of emotions and nuance in all her scenes. Her characterization of Maria Clara greatly improved from what most people have perceived her to be in the novels, and I greatly rooted her character. She is the best lady in this series IMO.
* **Rocco Nacino as Elias** \- apart from the ""Baguette!"" outcry that made me chuckle when I watched it, Rocco is actually a great choice for the freedom fighter Elias. I loved it when he survived, he really deserved more air time.
* **The supporting cast played by veteran actors** \- Maria Clara's parental figures, played by Juan Rodrigo and Ces Quesada, are well-fleshed out and equally worthy of sympathy. I also liked Gilleth Sandico's Donya Victorina despite her character being totally annoying. The same sentiments go to Raquel Pareño as Consolación and her husband, Giovanni Baldesseri´s Alferez.
* **Minor characters such as Lucia, Salome, Juli, Tales, Tasio, and Basilio are portrayed well too.**
* **Set and costume design** \- reimagining Manila and the fictional town of San Diego is not something I would call easy, despite existing resources showing some inklings of what these places looked like during the Spanish colonial era. With the help of set extras, the atmosphere felt almost real, alive, and nostalgic. The variety and intricacy of costumes on the majority of the characters is something worth noting as well, save for a few nitpicks I have on Fidel's costume, which I will be elaborating on later.
* **Some of the cinematography was actually appealing and fitting for the show.**
* **The theme song** \- I found it lovely and fitting for the series, with Julie Anne singing it well (as expected), I am also drawn into singing it too! I find it memorable and not pandering to one's ear, as compared to a lot of OSTs from Filipino TV shows.

The other pieces from the score aren't bad too, however, there are things I'd like to point out with this in the next section of my critique.

And as I said, it has its flaws. Here are the things I wish GMA will improve in their upcoming projects:

* **That dotted maroon cravat** \- What's with a cravat, girl? I am referring to Fidel's dotted maroon cravat, which, for some reason, appeared on a couple of episodes that were meant to depict separate days and events. I know, this is bordering nitpicking, but I could not help but notice how repetitive the appearance of that cravat is, which tells me three possibilities: Either 1) Fidel is some sort of a basic guy and has multiple cravats and suits of the same pattern and color (talk about Spongebob, or even Tom Scott the YouTuber), 2) A lot of scenes were filmed within a few hours or days time, and since costume changes are complicated, it stays as is, or 3) Unlike Dennis Trillo's Crisostomo Ibarra, Fidel's wardrobe was limited to a few suit, cravat, and hat options since it is implied that he wasn't supposed to be a bigger character than he is now. I mean, I understand that there will still be constraints in budgeting on costumes and other stuff, but I really wished that they could have at least given Fidel better cravats, you know. Perhaps more equality in costuming I guess since he is a wealthy man too (repetitive costumes make someone look like an NPC).

*(Edit:* u/ajujubells *provided an excellent counterargument with this entry in the comments below! Kindly check it out!)*

&#x200B;

* **The Klaybarra trap** \- I have heard that there were people who hated some of the earlier episodes' Klaybarra traps that got alluded to the ""kabit-seryes"" we all hate, and apart from that reasoning, I despised it since I knew its a filler tactic, and an effort to flesh out the familial bond between Ibarra and Klay. While it somehow justified Maria Clara's growing suspicions and jealousy over Ibarra and Klay, I do think there were better ways to do this.
* **Klay's light switch emotionality** \- Of course, Klay hails from a broken family, with her biological father calling her a mistake, and her stepfather being abusive to his mother and brother, which makes her internally emotional about things concerning feminism, social justice, and other events in life. But there was something that worried me, she seemed to flick on-and-off her emotions, especially tearing up too quickly, making it oddly unrealistic at some point in the show. I admire and respect Barbie for the actress she is, and I think the flaw lies within the way she was written. I think even for people who shed tears easily, this is not the most accurate representation of them too.
* **Some of the minor characters feel odd and out of place, you know?** The actor who plays Alfonso Linares is one of them. The younger version of Damaso is another one. I cannot enumerate all of them, but I hope you now understand my point.
* **Awkward Spanish-speaking characters** \- It is understandable that characters of Spanish descent are played by Filipino actors instead, but then I expected more of their better Spanish-speaking scenes. I found it ironic for a woman who only has gone to Manila, San Diego, and Antipolo to speak better Spanish than the actual Spanish Franciscan friars, government officials, and citizens! Yes, I am referring to Julie Anne's Maria Clara. How come two Spanish-born priests cannot string a single Spanish sentence properly? I do not know whether it was an intentional choice to depict their villainous theatricality and ridiculousness, but dear God, this isn't theatre, right? ([https://lajornadafilipina.com/commentary/spanish-maria-clara-at-ibarra/](https://lajornadafilipina.com/commentary/spanish-maria-clara-at-ibarra/))
* **Subpar sound mixing on some episodes/scenes** \- There are moments in the entire show wherein the dialogue suddenly becomes oddly sounding, as a result of a redub, and it can get jarring, especially to someone meticulous about things like that. Also, the show still bears problems in knowing which scene needs music, specifically loud background music, which can make it pandering. Can't we have a moment of serenity sometimes? You know, just appreciate the nature around them?
* **That seemingly never-ending Michael Bay spinning/arc shot** \- This typically happens whenever a romantic interaction between Klay and Fidel takes place, and I AM SICK OF IT. I saw the same dizzying shot in a couple of other Filipino dramas before, one example would be Joseph Marco and Maja Salvador's first kiss in *Wildflower*. There are better shots to show a couple's romantic and sexual attraction, and this is not it. (The Michael Bay spinning shot: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPtHPgZmZdA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPtHPgZmZdA))

This is so far my simplified\* commentary of GMA's Maria Clara and Ibarra. I hope to get either affirmations or challenges to the things I listed above! Thank you!

Why the country's religiousness is the root cause of its biggest cultural problems,"Admit it, at some point we have to discuss how religion, especially Abrahamic ones, are the reason why the Philippines:
• is mostly misogynistic, patriarchal, and sexist,
• is being taken advantage of its resilience,
• is so conservative that it leaves no room for liberal but beneficial and progressive ideals.


Misogyny, Patriarchy, Sexism (feat. Homophobia)

You could tally as many female-supportive Bible quotes as you want but it still wouldn't be half as many as those supportive of men. And by ""supportive"", I mean basically dictating that men are more important than women. And that's without even equating the quotes that dictate women to be compliant and obedient to men, especially their husbands.

And that's without including the Quran.

To think that these ideas are being instilled to us for 333 years, the Philippines went from being ""genderless"" or ""gender doesn't matter"" during pre-colonial times to using bakla as an insult whenever men show weakness or non-masculine traits and calling tomboyish, non-feminine women undesirable.


""Resilience"" aka Enforced Placebo

Ignoring the Bible's sexism, incest, and murder that rivals that of Game of Thrones, it does have a lot of feel-good quotes like Songs of Solomon and the many assurances that God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit will be there, will provide, will help you in times of trouble, etc.

The problems is too many Filipinos take these quotes to heart (and not just in the spiritual sense) that they let it affect their lives to an impractical scale.

Drowning in debt? God will provide! Suffering with physical pains and emotional trauma? Jesus will save! Having too many mouths to feed and pregnant with one more while barely living above the poverty line? It's a miracle from Him!

You don't have to wait for God to provide if you manage your money more and vote for politicians that don't inflate our costs of living every decade or so.

Yes, Jesus might save but you also need to go to the hospital to have it checked. Or maybe you just need to go to a psychiatrist and acquire some meds for your depression. You're not sad because you need more Jesus, you're sad because your brain is stubborn at it.

No, having more than 5 children with an incoming 6th while you could barely scrape by for your next meal is not a miracle, it's a disaster for dysfunctional family dynamics and lost childhood. You would've fed less than what you can afford if you weren't so adamant to believe that condoms and birth control pills are marked with 666 and ""kills"" life. You can't kill what's not even there. There's also the topic of abortion but, of course, our country will never be ready for that.

And all this is made worse by the fact that politicians and government officials love to exploit the hell out of this resilience by quoting God, praying for him, and seeking help from him while they pocket the expenses meant for the assisitance they are praying for.

And the crowd would follow suit and say ""Amen"".

And these people wonder why most secular and practical countries are first-wolrders.


Ultra-Conservatism

Religion, especially Catholicism, has long been enforcing the idea that too much freedom corrupts. Even though God gave as free will. But apparently everything is also God's plan so that free will is pretty much pointless.

Either way, these ideals are pretty much the reason why any law or idea that's rooted from liberal ideals are shot down immediately. And more so if those laws are not in line with a politician's Biblical views, no matter how great they will be for the general well-being of a lot of Filipinos.

And we're only talking about rights that give people a little freedom in general like:

A SOGIE bill that could ensure the well-being of LGBT Filipinos from being discriminated in their workplace and basically have the same civil rights as heterosexuals like getting married by law? But the Bible says no, so NO.

A divorce bill that could be for beneficial for women in abusive marriages but do not have the financial means for annulment and could ensure that their children are financially supported even after separation? But th-the-the sanctity of marriage! DENIED!

And let's not get started how a lot would talk shit about the Anti-Bastos Law before it was passed like: Women making men accountable for their unconsented sexual advances? Then they should dress and act more modestly like the Bible says so! It's their fault they're dressed in shorts and tank tops like a whore!


And they would stand for all this while doing the opposite. Except, of course, for misogyny.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/i69nid/why_the_countrys_religiousness_is_the_root_cause/,t2_64y6g13e,2020-08-09 08:01:28,183
[LF: Advice] Minsan Pakiramdam Ko Nasa Panganib Ang Buhay Ko,"Di ko mae-explain masyado pero may napapansin ako minsan sa kuya ko dahil sa malakas na aggressiveness niya at maliit na emotional maturity. 22-23 years old na siya, kaso malakas siya magtantrums. Nung nao-overload siya sa workload niya sa online classes niya sa college, nasusuntok niya yung pader tas napapasigaw sa galit. Naiintindihan ko na nakakasama ng loob yun kaso napaka-abnormal na yun para sa edad niya. Siya lang yung kilala ko na ganiyan.

May mga panahon din dati na hindi niya maintindihan ang concept of consent. Hindi talaga kami nagkakasunduan ng kuya ko, pilit lang na makipagsunduan esp nung sinapak niya ako nung 15 years old ako (20 na ako), nao-offend siya nung pinaparating ko sa kaniya na ayaw ko sa kaniya at kapag sinasabi ko na ""no"" o ""ayaw ko"" tungkol sa mga bagay-bagay. Napapa-tantrum siya. Ang lakas ng boses kung magtanong ng kung bakit ganon nararamdaman ko.

Dahil sa mga characteristics niya na ganiyan kasama na yung sobrang lakas niya magalit, minsan nararamdaman ko na baka at some point magwala siya at mapatay ako. Aside kasi sa mga nabanggit ko, nao-observe ko na may mali nga sa kaniya psychologically. Gawa rin ito kasi ng pagiging physically abusive ng tatay ko nung mas bata pa kami, at siya palagi yung scapegoat.

Nakwento ko na ito sa mga kaibigan ko kaso hirap kami magisip ng plano if ever may mangyari. Hindi ko kaya iwan mga alaga namin kasi parehas kuya ko at tatay ko mapanakit sa kanila kapag napipikon o naiinis sa hindi nila maintindihan sa mga aso namin. Nagaalala ako baka kung ano gawin nila sa kanila kapag bumukod na ako dito. Hindi ko rin kaya sabihan nanay ko kasi ofw siya at masyado niya binibigyan ng significance ang mga sibling relationship kaya mas uunahin niya yun kesa sa mga napapansin ko dito sa bahay.

duterte‬'s gambit #4: gold + shit.,"#duterte‬'s gambit #4: gold + shit.

Tell the story of an awesome accomplishment you did years ago (gold) but add a shocking joke (shit) so people all over will be aghast and spread the bad shit far and wide. But when the stink wears off, they find something golden.
Free national, local and international news, opponents talking about him, supporters of opponents talking about him, people who saw the gold defending him, the real mud of his opponents get dug up and thrown by supporters. Everyone gets mud all over their faces.

Media mileage so wide and the gold (that awesome story) is what the right people (he was targeting class B-C-D-E) now knows.

Sure, class A people and some got pissed off but he is the opposite of a rapist (see his protection of Women's rights in Davao City) so the shit he threw at himself will wash off. Meanwhile ‪#‎binay‬ and his mistress and ‪#‎roxas‬ abusing a beauty queen resulting to a son (allegedly) are now out in the open again.

So the B-C-D-E classes who were shocked and shaken realized the plot twist, allowing an emotional conversion that hooks them more to Duterte. This is how fan girls and fan boys are made.

Wow, just wow.

The perks of an anti-fragile candidate.

Respeto movie discussion [Spoilers],"""It's a great movie with a political message"" is the only thing I knew about the movie before I watched it last night.

Let me start off by saying - **For me**

**For me**, the movie is a train wreck. There were a lot of ideas the director/screenwriter/producers could've executed better. I'd like to enumerate some that I think could have been done in a different or more simpler way:

***Abra's chubby friend*** - The chubby guy had no other purpose than to die in the end. It was pretty obvious when the movie established him with a death flag by being the ""guy who hears about everyone dying"". The comic relief shtick of his was unnecessary and the ideology that ""innocent people are being killed/ejk's are real"" can still be pursued without him. 

***Abra's female friend*** - Her purpose was to show that women are being abused still by people with authority as seen by the cop harassing her with the unnecessary inspection. That's literally it. That's her character arc climax and nothing noteworthy happens to her again. The ideology that ""women are treated like 2nd class citizens/police are still abusing women"" can be conveyed without her.

Also I think the only time we hear her name was when the doctor mentioned it at the latter part of the movie. Not sure with this one.

***Abra's sister*** - Which conveniently brings me to her. She could've been the weak willed, kind hearted, martyr that loves Abra, and is stuck in abusive relationship sister instead of the druggie/junkie sister who hates his no use brother to make the story less complicated and more streamlined. It would've made the diy budget cake more meaningful and heartfelt and her death more impactful. She could've played the chubby friends purpose of getting emotionally invested to a character while also being the female friend's purpose of conveying women's abuse.

What's my point in what I've written above? Well, Abra's friends were written because they needed to progress the story, which is bad writing in general. The story should progress organically and not because it needs to. The movies story could have still happened without the two so why include them in the first place?

Another thing I noticed is the lack of character motivation and development.

***Abra's love interest*** - So you see this cute guy, give him fuck me eyes, see him bomb and pee himself and get obviously repulsed. Everyone makes fun of him and he gets known to be the loser guy who pees himself. You see him again (now you hate him) yet he pulls out a few corny lines (he lost a rap battle so it's clear that he sucked) and now you guys are okay? What? Pareho bang Martha pangalan ng nanay nila? I actually cringed and looked away when they kissed because the whole shoe horned love interest was terrible. 

Again, Candy was also there to show how people can be easily abused in that kind of environment and nothing else. Could've been written better.

***Doctor*** - Not much at fault here except the flashbacks. It was too much artsy with the papers falling. Also, it was **hinted** that he considered Hendrix, a guy he recently met, his son and his real son as someone he regrets putting up with during the last few scenes when he muttered anak at the direction of Abra. Why? Maybe because he saw his younger self in him with all the Rap Battles/Baligtasan? He saw potential? He's cute? We don't know. And that's another problem. Wala naman problema kung maattach ka sa isang tao na kakakilala mo lang, ang problema ay hindi claro kung bakit.

***Abra/Hendrix*** - The guy who was born into poverty and wants to get out to get a better life. Skilled, talented, has his way with women, and not really a criminal but enough of a trouble maker to charm you. Aka Gary Stu until he kills the cop at the end for no reason at all than just to show that the cycle that happened during the marcos regime is still happening. He was shown to have a good heart when he ""defended his sister"" before the opening chase scene, repaying the doctor, and wanting to get out of the drug trade industry, so why the hell would you suddenly make him ""go blind with rage like the doctor"" when it's not part of his character?

The last scene also made me go ""what the fuck"" which made other people around me laugh. What is with this spurts of artsy scenes with the paper? Symbolism of what, the Marcos era? There are several, more simpler ways to allude to that.

The movie had a certain theme of old school vs new school and showing that not much has changed. Whether in rap battles, the government, authorities, crime, and abuse. I think that was the main message Respeto was trying to convey. **For me**, the issue is with the story telling and pacing. It could've been better with a little bit of streamlining and making things simple. Especially when you're trying to show a very complex idea that ""nothing has changed since then"". It was trying to be so many things at once; an art film, a political film, a film about xyz culture, a film about a man born into disadvantage wanting to have a better life, et al. 

Why not try to be a decent, simple, effective movie first?

Hopefully, the word disccusion in the title elicits just that and no ""ur wrong bc u dont get the movie u stupid nd shallow support pinoy films huhu"" nonsense. It's fine if you liked the movie and you don't share my opinions. It's completely fine if you loved the movie and think it's the best film this year. If you think I'm wrong, then please tell me why properly.

Let's take a minute to discuss the position of ALL the presidential politicians on the issue of legalizing divorce.,"I'm surprised to learn that NONE of the presidential candidates are in favor of legalizing divorce, and I've speculated on their reasoning for this:

1) Sadly, there is not enough voters who are strongly in favor of changing the family code to allow divorce to make this an issue for politicians, and risk offending ""the religious Filipino"" and being seen as too liberal (ha!).

Being the only nation in the world that criminalizes divorce supports the romantic (and IMO unhealthy and unrealistic) ideal of love being ""forever"" and ""happily ever after"", notions that come from movies and songs and give people fuzzy minds about the realities of love and lust, and allow so many people to be hurt and used by others. Still, Filipinos, seem to get a sense of pride and satisfaction from the illegality of divorce, it makes them feel like, ""at least in this one area, we are better than the rest of the world, we still believe in love.""

But that is a false perspective, and in fact, the relationships of people in countries with legal divorce tend to be stronger, more realistic, and above all, more mature, because those people know their relationships are in their own hands and they have the freedom to make up their own minds.

2) It would be too much work, and involve too much time and effort to overhaul the legal system to include divorce as an option for people to end their marriages when annulment already exists and serves the function of ending a legal contract. Legalizing divorce would add several complications to the process that would clog up the courts with an abundance of work, as they would have to figure in child custody decisions, alimony decisions, etc.

3) Alimony and division of property cases would be horrendous, there would be marriage/divorce scams where people would marry someone just to try to get ""50%"".

4) The claim of most of the politicians for not supporting a divorce law is that they support the nuclear family as the backbone of society. What President would knowingly allow people to divorce, creating that kind of instability in the social structure during their term? That would be self-defeating.

It's true, that divorce would destabilize the social structure AT FIRST, then there would be a growing period, and people would become more mature in their relationships, and families and society would become stronger in the long run.

It is inevitable, in a free and civilized society to have the option of divorce. The longer it stays illegal in the Philippines the more social damage it will cause when it does become law. The sooner the growing pains are out of the way and overcome, the faster Philippines can become a more mature people, and a more free and civilized developing nation, not simply the facade of one.

However, it would be a very difficult change and would not impact any presidential term positively, so what must be done stays undone out of fear, and the longer we wait, the harder it will be.

(Fun fact: Divorce was legal in the Philippines until 1950, only in 1950 did it become illegal, and then it was written into the family code in 1987.)

The important thing to remember is that not allowing a place for divorce in the family code is not due to a strong belief by lawmakers and politicians in marriage and love. It is an attempt at preserving the facade of social stability which in reality is a ticking time bomb to social instability. It allows for marital abuse, marital rape, unhealthy financial and emotional dependency, helplessness, emotional immaturity, adultery, abandonment, and unhealthy manipulations and control in relationships. Children suffer more from a bad marriage than they would from a good divorce. Change and growth cannot be prevented through resistance to change, that only makes the change more damaging. A culture of people cannot remain as children, allowing ""authorities"" to guide and control their private lives (and their minds) without nightmarish consequences.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/4e4o0k/lets_take_a_minute_to_discuss_the_position_of_all/,t2_wqx7j,2016-04-10 13:00:49,5
The Postmortem: The Hilarious Case of the KakamPinks; A Concise Guide on How NOT to Campaign for Dummies BY Dummies,"| mean, seriously, is it any wonder why Leni Robredo lost? If you still don't understand it yet, let me spell it out.

The KakamPink branding, along with its associated product, were doomed to fail from the start.

From the moment Robredo proclaimed her intention to run ""if only to block another Marcos from assuming office,’ up to the moment she queued up to the voting precinct. Failure was written all over the place.

In this guide, let's ascertain point by point where your (the KakamPinks') campaign went south.

But first, a disclaimer: **Whenever | talk about KakamPinks in this guide, do note that | am not generalizing KakamPinks as a whole but am pertaining to its noisiest and most toxic sample of population. Bato bato sa langit, ang tamaan, wag masyadong pahalata.**

**1. You tried to sell your candidate as the sole moral choice, the ""good"" choice as compared to other candidates.**

\-This has been the fatal flaw of the Pink campaign machinery. In my experience, it is wise not to view politics as a simplistic battle between ""good"" vs. ""evil"" and light vs. darkness.

\-In politics, there are no such things, only necessities and interests.

\-By selling your candidate as the ""moral"" choice, you unwittingly created an army of moral crusaders and zealots indoctrinated to fight the ""good"" fight. This sense of self-righteousness leads to societal division as these moral crusaders are rendered willing to compromise even familial ties and romantic relationships in the name of their twisted perception of what is good.

\-In your obsession with the notion that you're fighting the ""good"" fight, you forget that the other side also believes that they're also fighting the ""good"" fight in their own perception.

\-You disregarded the fact that everyone, at least in their own mind, is a good person. It just so happened that you believe to be the ""good-er"" person because you're voting Pink.

**2. Instead of actually listening to the other side, you dismissed them and called them names.**

\-In your ""tara usap tayo"" shenanigans, you never actually attempted to listen to the other side. You engaged with them, but you sure did love the sound of your own voice.

\-When a person from the other side presented points and quoted sources, you readily dismissed them, called them names such as ""trolls,"" ""bayaran,’ ""bobo,' ""enablers,"" “apologists, and many more. Some even turned off their sense of reading comprehension! Many others dismiss sources like Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and TikTok without ever realizing many credible sources do use those platforms, or even have a sense of discernment.

\-In your perceived superiority, you forgot that people have their own minds and will not be readily swayed by being verbally abused.

**3. You bullied non-Pinks into submission and BBM supporters to the point of hiding in the closet. You engaged in cancel culture.**

\-Many have been subjected to this. There are those who endorsed other presidential candidates that can see this behavior. While this behavior can be seen in other candidates' supporters, it is readily exposed in a lot of KakamPinks by simply calling them out, and in a more substantial amount.

\-Many times, tweets belonging to other supporters, especially BBM supporters have been taken out of context, shared among social media echo chambers so that they can circle-jerk among themselves. 

\-On the other hand, KakamPinks resorted to ""cancelling"" out and proud BBM supporters by having them fired from their jobs, by shaming them in social media, by treating them as social pariahs, and the worst, disowning even loved ones who intended to vote for BBM.

\-As a result, BBM supporters had to hide their partisan colors for fear of losing livelihood, loved ones, or face.

**4. You focused too much on negative campaigning.**

\-Elections are personal and emotional matters. A lot of people hold their candidates close to heart. As much as you claim to profess love for Leni Robredo, so too do Bongbong Marcos supporters.

\-Instead of highlighting what's good about your candidate, you focused too much on what's bad about THEIR candidate, under the guise of truth, and the excuse that 'hindi paninira ang pagsabi ng totoo'. But when KakamPinks are subjected to it, they easily disparage it as 'conspiracy theories.' 

\-Even a teenager will be able to tell you that once he's enamored over someone, all he can see about that person are the good and there's nothing so bad you can say that will change his mind. In fact, he will just double-down instead of caving in.

**5. A lot-and | mean a LOT--of KakamPinks are clout chasers**

\-Enough said. KakamPinks made the Pink campaign about THEMSELVES, and not about their candidate.

\-As such, you ended up sounding insincere and inauthentic. You even resorted to outright lie about encounters that could only possibly happen in a telenovela.

\-You were such attention vampires you forgot that the cause was not about you but about the nation.

**6. You have no sense of humor.**

\-You cant laugh at yourselves. 

\-You can't laugh at your candidates, presumably because they're already laughingstocks, or worse, they're treated and even unduly venerated like some goddess.

\-Everyone must walk on egg shells to cater to your fragile egos.

\-Politics isn't for the faint of heart nor is it for the weak-minded. If you can't handle a little bardagulan and end up blocking your banter-mates, then better let the actual grown-ups handle things.

\-You pick a fight with anyone who said something you didn't like.

**7. Last but not least, your candidate was never saleable to begin with.**

\-For the last 6 years, Leni Robredo mindlessly opposed a vastly popular president.

\-For the last 6 years, Leni Robredo antagonized the BBM supporters instead of bringing them into her fold.

\-For the last 6 years, she fumbled her way interview after interview spewing mind-numbing nonsense which were turned into memes and reaction videos.

\-Filipinos were laughing AT her, not WITH her.

Next time, for these rabid KakamPinks, maybe try not to be such pompous, insufferable pricks and rein in your own comrades when they step the line?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/un0yg5/the_postmortem_the_hilarious_case_of_the/,t2_6lkjlsxe,2022-05-11 12:00:25,0
Why I stopped supporting Duterte,"

By: Rene Bustamente

""As a small business owner and somewhat influential in our small community, at least fifty of my friends and acquaintances decided to vote the then Mayor and Presidential candidate Rodrigo Duterte, after talking to them personally.

I think Duterte’s uniqueness and unorthodox style is what made me liked him. That was more than a year ago though, a couple of months before the 2016 General Elections.

I donated hundreds upon hundreds of T-shirts bearing Duterte’s name. I distributed thousands of Duterte stickers to Jeepney drivers and tens of thousands of rubber wristbands. My devotion to then unknown Duterte was unparalleled.

Several months after he took office as the new Philippine President, the New Bilibid Prison scandal broke out, and Sen. Leila De Lima was thrown inside jail. Duterte accused De Lima of having bank accounts containing hundreds of millions of drug money, but that accusation has never been proven while De Lima is living with uncertainty behind bars.

After a year in office, Duterte’s cursing has been becoming stronger and stronger – an attitude that made himself looked like an uneducated bully who grew-up in a squatter’s area. As the years progresses, Duterte is showing himself to the public a clear example of someone who, despite of high education, has no breeding.

Duterte’s insults are backfiring towards him. His arrogance is becoming unbearable. Instead of proving himself innocent and silencing his critics, his rotting mouth is always in full display like a broken record (sirang plaka). Duterte is not a “strong man”. He is a weak old man who, like many other politicians, is hungry of power. Without guns and power, Duterte is nothing but a useless sob.

I didn’t like Sen. Antonio Trillanes ever since. But the continuing rift between him and the dirty old man only proves who is a better strategist. Trillanes is always calm, while Duterte is always a crybaby, like his disciple Ronald “Bato” dela Rosa, an unqualified police officer to handle such big responsibility.

I couldn’t believe, that at the age of 72, Duterte still has no balls to silence his critic by signing a waiver. Instead, he continue to play people’s emotions in order to divert the real issue.

While Trillanes has proven Duterte wrong, the latter did nothing but hide behind his power.

Let’s take a look at Duterte’s failures and some lies
He promised to end drug problem in three to six months.
He boasted to end Marawi confict in three days.

He is fond of appointing unqualified and incompetent people due to “utang na loob” (debt of gratitude). Ex. Mocha Uson, Cesar Montano, etc.

He is always full of himself, saying unnecessary words on public. Example: In a speech during the DOJ anniversary, Duterte taunted some of his cabinet members of being first honors, but ended-up being his employees. “Si Delfin, si Dominguez, mga first honor yan, pero nasaan sila ngayon? Empleyado ko lang” – What exactly are you trying to say Mr. President?

He promised to double the salary of policemen. He promised to wipe-out rogue police, but in the case of Supt. Lito Cabamongan, the highest ranking police officer caught red handed while taking meth, the officer only suspended more than 5 months later. No police officer has been jailed yet because of drugs, especially those who were caught in the act.

He invented Trillanes’ fake bank accounts and lied to the whole public.

I supported Duterte’s war on drugs, but I do not support how it is carried out, especially when innocent people are killed by his trigger-happy policemen.

His plan to pick Brgy. Captains instead of going through elections is alarming and dangerous as well. If not endorsed by abusive people close to him, may alam kaya si Duterte kung sino ang i-appoint niyang maging Brgy. Captain sa lugar niyo? What a stupid plan. Appointing someone who local people don’t like will only result to a bigger problem. Is Duterte a real lawyer, or just old enough to think sensible things?

Duterte has been showing frustrations when taunted by his political opponents, especially Sen. Trillanes. Trillanes knows exactly what Duterte’s weakness is – galitin si Duterte at malay mo baka sa sobrang pagka-pikon ay atakihin sa puso. Duterte can’t really handle criticism, because he is not used to it.

Why Duterte Won’t Destroy the NPA (Even If He Can) “Ikaw ba naman ang hari sa Davao for more than 20 years. Hindi ka sanay na may taong bumabatikos at sumasagot sayo, tapos nong naging Presidente ka kaliwa’t kanan ang batikos? Duterte is not prepared for this kind of pressure”, political analyst Prof. Sotero Purcel said.

Why I stopped supporting Duterte? Well because he is starting to show his true colors. That he is nothing but incompetent President who only a leads in cursing, lying, and using force in order to achieve what he want. I don’t expect him to finish his term. I don’t expect him to face his critics in a civil way. Duterte is half-civilized with zero breeding.

Only people with low-level IQ and without personal principles, will continue to support this rogue president.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/ca688j/why_i_stopped_supporting_duterte/,t2_vhu2o2g,2019-07-07 20:18:03,86
Narcissistic Filipino mother wants to move with me to the US,"I barely have any positive, happy memories of my mother. From what I have researched, she either is a Covert Narcissist or has Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). Many of my memories of her are her being physically, emotionally, and verbally abusive to me. My father worked in the Middle East from when I was 4 years old and permanently returned when I was 16. Until then, I would only see him once a year, so my mother really ruled the roost. I'm the only child.

I understand that in our Filipino culture, corporal punishment towards children is ""somewhat acceptable."" I say this because from what I've noticed, some Filipinos still uphold this belief, and are quite proud of this as well. I experienced it all - midribs of the coconut leaf, kneeling on mung beans, belt buckle, chili peppers forced into my mouth but would often times get smeared all over my face and eyes, etc. Slippers were to weak for her.

I was punished for simple ""mistakes."" For example, on my first grade graduation, I refused to wear curlers. Apparently, being an honor student didn't matter to her because the curlers were of more importance that she beat the sh\*t out of me with her high heels only because I refused to curl my hair. Looking at my graduation pictures, I looked very sad and my eyes were very swollen.

One of the worst things that happened to me was when I was 6. I was beckoned by our landlord into his house (my mother was at home busy karaoke-ing and smoking with her younger sister and friends). This was where the abuse happened. I was too afraid to tell my mother that I never told her until 3 years later. But she didn't do squat. My parents didn't do squat. Often times, I would try to justify this that maybe they were too afraid, maybe there weren't enough resources at that time unlike today, maybe they didn't know who to run to, maybe they were embarrassed, maybe I told them too late, I don't know. All I know is none of them did squat. This topic sometimes comes up when my mother and I fight, but all she says is, ""you're so blessed now. Just move on with your life.""

I don't know how my mother was raised, but I'm sure she learned the sh\*t she did to me from somewhere. One of her brothers, my uncle, wrote a song for his middle child. He would ask her to sing this song over and over and if my cousin made a mistake, he would beat the sh\*t out of her. How could you beat your child for this reason? He does this kasi trip lang nya.

When I became a teenager, the physical beatings stopped, but her anger she expressed in other ways. The worst of them all was every time she was upset, she would wake my dad and I up to start havoc. She believes that if you purposely disrupt someone's sleep, this would upset them too much that they would be more inclined to listen to you. One night, she tried to wake me, so I pretended to not hear her and pretended to continue sleeping. She then picked up the remote control and repeatedly threw it on my head to wake me up. Often times, I would go to school groggy having been woken up the night before.

When I was in my mid 20s, I was already working, but still living with my parents. My cousin, who studying for the nursing board exam, moved in with us. My cousin and I were like sisters and were very close growing up. For some reason, my mother developed really strong affection towards my cousin and her anger towards me became stronger. This was probably because my cousin was more affectionate that I was, but then again, how can I be affectionate when she would always beat the crap out of me. My cousin would even ask why I seemed to always be the target of my mother's tantrums.

One day, my cousin was wearing super red shoes. I commented, ""Those are really red shoes!"" My cousin and I didn't think much of it, but this drove my mother insane thinking I was being critical of my cousin. She was so mad that she told me, ""You're just jealous because your cousin is prettier than you!"" Mind you, I never felt any jealousy towards my cousin. We were very close and often, there'd be some friendly banter between us.

Some time during that time, the movie ""New Moon"" premiered. None of my friends and co-workers could watch it with me and my cousin was the only one available, so we watched it together. My mother lost her sh\*t again. She accused me of seeing my cousin only because she believes I had intentions of backbiting her. None of this was true. My mother is so exhausting that talking about her with other people just never interested me.

For many years, I would repeatedly write the words, ""freedom"", ""emancipation"", etc. I really wanted to live on my own, far far away from my mother. I applied for jobs in Singapore and Australia, but none of them worked out. However, I believe I was still manifesting this in some way because in 2010, I landed a job in the US. Mind you, I never applied for this particular job. My employer just found my work online and invited me to work with them. It's almost like God or the universe found a way to remove me from the toxic household I was living in.

When I was getting all my US paperwork ready, we found out on my birth certificate that my parents weren't actually married. Apparently, my dad was married prior to marrying my mother (that he never filed annulment for), so their actual marriage was never valid to begin with. This catapulted my mother from being crazy to being absolutely batsh\*t insane.

When I moved to the US, she offered to help and stayed with me for 6 months. We would still often fight that one time, she locked me out of my own apartment. While I was so happy to get my own place, it still felt like I was walking on eggshells in my own home.

Just before I left the US, I purchased a condo in the city. I have been sending my mortgage ($500/mo) to my mother's bank account trusting her to pay my mortgage for me. This went on for \~4 years. One day, I got a call from my dad saying he's too tired of my mother pushing him to work. Apparently, my mother has been pocketing the money I've been sending her and she's been forcing my dad to pay for my condo mortgage. While my dad actually enjoys working because this forces him to leave the house and not have to see my mother's face every minute, the pressure from my mother was too much for him.

When I asked her about this, I tried to do in a non-confrontational way. I told her that I don't have a problem if she needed to use the money. What mattered to me is that she communicated this. But as always, she lost her sh\*t again to the point that she was almost hyperventilating. She tried to justify this, but eventually turned into victim mode - that I am trying to take away something that she enjoys (""managing"" my condo).

I really don't know why my mother seems to be so money-hungry. I remember when I was in high school, she would get so much anxiety if my dad's salary were a couple hours delayed. She would force me to call my dad's Finance Department to follow up and ask why my dad's salary is delayed. I remember being utterly embarrassed having to do this.

My parents have visited me almost every year here in the US, but every time my mom is in our house, there's always a lot of tension in the air. One time, she was crying uncontrollably because I apparently didn't ""invite her to dinner."" TBH, this was never intentional. I don't even have any recollection of this happening. But this was a time when I was almost going into labor, so there were a lot of things running through my head that I may have just eaten on my own and she happened to walk by. She told her relatives that ""we never invite her to eat"" and ""we deprive her of food."" Victim mode again. Like wtf. This couldn't be farther from the truth.

The other time they were here, we were fighting about something. My husband walked in on us and asked what was going on. I was so upset that I just told him, ""I don't know, I can't f\*ing deal with this"" and walked away. My mother twisted my words and launched a smear campaign against me. She texted her relatives and MY friends and told them I said ""f\*ck you"" to her.

Up to this day, even though she's so far away, we often fight. I limited my contact with her because it was stressing me out that I would sometimes snap on my own husband and young daughter. I'm very determined to end this generational trauma, but every time she calls me, she always says something that I find triggering. For example, she asked if she could move in with me and be given an allowance of $100 per week, so she can help around the house. I politely declined, but told her I can send her money when she needs it (I just sent her $1,500 to pay for her attorney fees). I told her we were on a budget which she then scoffed at and mocked.

Since I moved to the US, she's been asking to move in with me. She says that ""I'm the only child that refuses to sponsor their parent for a green card."" She's been blaming my husband - that it's my husband who is convincing me to disallow this.

I really want to forgive my mother, but I ABSOLUTELY CANNOT have her live with me. Her definition of us reconciling is me sponsoring her for a green card. I also can't really have an open, heart to heart, honest conversation with her because she just shuts me down, so nothing ever gets resolved. I'm afraid she will ruin the life and family that I built. Plus, I cannot afford it financially. Not only will my mother rely on me for healthcare, insurance, etc. (which I'll find ways to make it work if she were a loving and nurturing mother to begin with), but in addition to this, she demands to be paid $100/week or $500/mo in exchange for ""helping around the house.""

If I've noticed change in her, maybe I would reconsider, but so far during their visits here, she still constantly screams at my dad over trivial matters in front of my husband and daughter. The topic of my dad's first wife from over 40 years ago still constantly comes up. Every time I tell her to calm down, she says, ""this is their normal,"" so I shouldn't get all bent up. My husband and I never really fight. We made it a point that if one of us is upset, we always talk through it. So I'm very afraid that if she does move in with us, this will ruin our family and our peaceful home that we worked so hard for.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/133zmz8/narcissistic_filipino_mother_wants_to_move_with/,t2_99h5dut0,2023-05-01 02:44:34,11
A long/short history of why the Villars are the biggest Stock Market conmen in Philippine History,"Yesterday, the Villar telco company Streamtech announced that they will back out of the 3rd telco bid. That's not much news in itself but if you're familiar with how the Villar's routinely milks the stock market, it's just shows how these fuckers are making a travesty out of stock trading.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Let's start from the top. The Villar's own a public company, Camella & Palmera Homes (C&P). In 1997, they borrowed some 150 million USD from different banks. This debt is due to be paid by 2003, and theyre required to pay interest every year before maturity.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

2 years later, C&P says it cant pay anymore so it defaulted. Manny Villar was at the time Speaker of the House.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

C&P then hires Deustche bank to help them with dealing with the debt they cannot pay. Working with the banks that lent money, C&P and Manny agreed that the debt will be lessened in exchange for Manny paying some of the debt out of his pocket, and for C&P to be partially controlled by the lending banks. In turn C&P can continue paying regularly. Fair enough? Fair enough.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

What the lenders did not know at the time though was that C&P was a terrible company. Ayala in their willingness to buy the company looked into C&P records and revealed that C&P have lands that have no titles, they have titles that have no lands, and cash control is known only to one man: Manny Villar. The total price of their assets was largely determined by how Villar himself valued the lands it owned. Naturally he overpriced junk lands.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

When the time came to finalize the debt restructuring, C&P just went silent. The representatives of C&P said Villar will have the final say, and guess what, he never said anything to the group.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Instead, Villar approached the banks one by one, offering lands in exchange for the debt. The lands were priced set by Villar, which were of course overpriced. Along with the lands, allegedly, came threats that if they don't accept it, they don't get anything at all, and earn the ire of the 3rd highest public official in the land.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

With the debts ""paid"", Villar then took what was left of C&P and then had it absorbed by a shell company called Vista Land (VLL) and then once again, SOLD the company to the public at an overpriced rate. Why did they agree? When the third most powerful politician at the time tells you it's a good deal, it IS a good deal and you're not allowed to think otherwise.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Take note that public owners of C&P stock never got anything after they defaulted citing lack of funds to pay back stock holders without liquidating assets it's owned. No need to get into details, but that's not how backruptcy works at all.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Instead what they owned, got sent to another company and had that sold to other people.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Imagine if you let a car to a friend, a friend told your car is broken and instead of returning the broken car to you, he just sells it to somebody else. That is Villar.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

With the money he got from the VLL sale, he used it to run for President. And with the prospect of becoming president, VLL share prices rose because traders know Villar was the type who'd abuse his power to get his company ahead - why not join him in reaping the fruits?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Instead he LOST, taking away billions from him. And VLL? People found out how bad its assets were

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Money had to be made back somehow. Take note, that this is just on stocks and not even including any sleazy shit he was pulling on the property side of things, the redirection of the C5 extension and how his properties somehow always gets in the way of govt roads, how Daang Hari roadside is mysteriously filled with Villar-owned villages etc.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Anyhoo, flash forward to the last 2 years. People have been clamoring for a 3rd Telco to compete with PLDT and Globe. Naturally, anybody who would become the 3rd telco will likely become a very big entity. And it will get the help of the government.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That also meant that any corporation that might even have a hint of pursuing 3rd telco status would have their stock prices surging.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The Villars saw another opportunity.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So early last year, they dropped hints that they ""might"" be interested in becoming 3rd telco. No details. Just press release.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

But they had no telcom companies! So what's going to happen? Somehow, ""somebody"" mysteriously leaked that one of their companies might get repurposed to become a holding for a new telcom company (Streamtech).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

First it was STR (Starmalls). What better company to hold streamtech than a company with a similar sounding stock symbol? STR went from 78billion valuation to 164 billion almost overnight. Then Golden Haven (HVN) was rumored to be the actual telco company! (Yes, it's the funeraria whose closest business to telco is the free wifi you get during wakes) The ridiculousness didnt matter. It went from 10 billion valuation to 33 billion valuation in a few days.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Then no other news after those stocks rose. People got antsy, so Villar announced that Starmalls actually had new malls to open! For stock speculators who were already deseprate for news that they did not get conned, any news is good. So this became the official justification of the rise. For HVN? Same banana. The Villars sent some other diversionary news to justify holding on to HVN - also unrelated to the telco issue.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Meanwhile, the Villars saw their valuations grow at least 300% by just playing with the idea that they are interested in the Telco industry.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That was January this year.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Later this year, the 3rd Telco race heated up. No news from the Villars still. Then, as the filing approached, franchise was in a very timely manner given to Streamtech, sending people into a frenzy. Why else would streamtech become a franchisee if not for the 3rd telco slot?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Starmall, despite not having anything to do with Streamtech at all, jumped again. All on the idea that maybe streamtech will win the bid and that maybe starmall will eventually own streamtech - despite having no real justification.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The past few weeks, Streamtech went so far as submitting a willingess to bid for the 3rd telco making it official. Share prices jumped even more.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

All the while these share price jumps are happening, stocks are slowly being sold into the market by people who know the timing of these ""news bits"". This is called insider trading. Very illegal, but hardly ever enforced. I can guarantee you at least a dozen companies do it at any given time, but nobody has ever gone to jail for it. NOBODY.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Which brings us to today. So the Villars have now sold what they want to sell, at a price that's factors higher than their initial prices, and then on a Sunday, in a Hitlerian move, they announce that Streamtech is no longer going to pursue the 3rd telco. That they just changed their minds.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The effect?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Villar company stocks will likely plummet. Allowing those who've already sold to buy back their previous stocks at cheaper prices, essentially making money by circulating their shares.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

But likely people will still be in denial, so the share prices will never go back to their original prices, making the Villars and whoever else did insider trading both rich from the sales, and rich from the value of their shares.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

These moves earned people billions. Just by manipulating the news, emotions, rumors, and the

&#x200B;

stock market.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Sure, other people do it, but not in the scale that the Villars have done over the years. They've been earning BILLIONS in the last 2 decades doing these shenanigans.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

What's my point? Why do I write this? Because I want people to avoid Villar stocks in general. (VLL, HVN, STR). Not because you can't earn from it, but because participating in this scheme of stock manipulation you become an accessory to the people behind them.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

tl;dr The Villars are shady as fuck. Never trust them with anything. Specially in the stock market.

"Worst News Ever: No BGC Cats were ever found, and now nobody directly involved wants to step up to formally file legal charges against Shangri-La BGC and PestBusters","FROM THE FACEBOOK ACCOUNT OF BAGUIO ANIMAL WELFARE (PLEASE HELP SUPPORT THIS GOOD MAN)

UPDATE: 
I will be in Manila (NCR) Saturday to Monday, March 3-5, to meet with potential complainants and witnesses in the BGC Cats case and the UP Manila Cats case.
If interested, please contact me for meeting arrangements.
Otherwise, if you have concerns that need my assistance, please call or text.

ORIGINAL POST:
When cat lover Marcelle John Marcelino revealed in an expose posted on February 16, at 8:41 pm, the case of the relocated BGC cats, it has become a discussion in a group chat (gc) that I have been involved with, named Alabang Cats (labeled as such because it has been addressing concerns on the abused cats in Alabang, among other issues), which also included CARA President Nancy Cu Unjieng.

On FEBRUARY 17, 12:05pm, Luzviminda Anne Santos Morales created the group chat Justice for Shangri-la The Fort BGC Cats, which included Marlon S. Gregorio (Philippine Dogs and Cats Rescuers Association, Inc.), Nancy Cu Unjieng, Leslie Ann Santos (admin of Cats of BGC), and later, added 3 other members of the Cats of BGC (Claire a foreign national who is out of the country at that time, May and Laverne) . . . just 7 members.

I HAVE BEEN ADVISING the 2 discussion groups, from the start, on the legal implications, and what possible recourse can be taken to seek justice for the cats, should talks inevitably fail. Moreover, I inform them of my next steps so that there should be no surprises.

I ARRIVED in Manila from Baguio on February 21, and talked on the phone to some members of the Cats of BGC, trying to convince any one or more of them to act as complainants since they are the publicly acknowledged active ‘caretakers’ of the cats.

AT THAT POINT, it has been my strong suspicion that the cats may have already been terminated by PestBusters in the same manner that they probably habitually, routinely and methodically eliminate pests (by poisoning and disposing off by incineration or burying them in their usual pest graveyard).

A CASE OF ABANDONMENT

MOREOVER, I believe that while there have been dedicated efforts to find the cats, a complaint may already be filed for violation of Section 7 (ABANDONMENT) of the Republic Act No. 8485, otherwise known as the “Animal Welfare Act of 1998” as amended by RA No. 10631, to state:

""SECTION 7. It shall be unlawful for any person who has custody of an animal to abandon the animal.

“If any person being the owner or having charge or control of any animal shall without reasonable cause or excuse abandon it, whether permanently or not, without providing for the care of that animal, such act shall constitute maltreatment under Section 9.

""If the animal is left in circumstances likely to cause the animal any unnecessary suffering, or if this abandonment results in the death of the animal, the person liable shall suffer the maximum penalty.

""Abandonment means the relinquishment of all right, title, claim, or possession of the animal with the intention of not reclaiming it or resuming its ownership or possession."" (END)

SECTION 9 states that:

""If the violation is committed by a JURIDICAL PERSON (corporation), the officer responsible thereof shall serve the imprisonment.

“If the violation is committed by an ALIEN, he or she shall be immediately deported after the service of sentence without any further proceeding.

""The foregoing penalties shall also apply for any other violation of this Act, depending upon the effect or result of the act or omission as defined in the immediately preceding sections.

""However, regardless of the resulting condition to the animal/s, the penalty of TWO (2) YEARS and ONE (1) DAY to THREE (3) years and/or a fine NOT exceeding TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PESOS (P250,000.00) shall be imposed if the offense is committed by any of the following: 
(1) a syndicate; 
(2) an offender who makes business out of cruelty to an animal; 
(3) a public officer or employee; or 
(4) where at least THREE (3) ANIMALS are involved. [Here is where PestBusters is qualified] (END)

The CATS of BGC REPRESENTATIVES.

In the afternoon of February 21, I invited members of the Cats of BGC to meet with me at the BGC Park where the “relocated” cats have used to roam. My intention is to brief them on the law and legal procedures and motivate them to fight for justice. And should they decide, and only then I shall craft the Affidavit of Complaint.

In the group discussion, a member of Cats of BGC states: “Cats of BGC is just a loose group of members trying to find homes for cats. Personally, I see it as a FB group and not a legal entity. Hence Claire and I were always clear that we want to stay out of the ‘campaigning’ or the lobbying against whoever and leave that part up to CARA as it is way bigger than us. If you think we still need to do that affidavit, Im open with discussing about the implications before I sign up for anything.”

Two members of Cats of BGC were available and met with me at the park. I also saw 4 cats leisurely wandering nearby, which are occasionally are being pet by park goers, some of whom are children.

At the start of the meeting, I introduced myself and informed them that I am Senior Advocate of Baguio Animal Welfare (BAW), and that we have been assisting in animal welfare legal cases from Isabela to Davao. Moreover, I informed them that I need person(s) who shall act as complainant(s) on the affidavits that I shall draft.

They reiterated to me that Cats of BGC has no legal personality, and that they are just concerned with the feeding and adoption of the cats. Therefore, they are not interested to engage in legal pursuits. On the other hand, one of them asked me what will happen (implications) if they file a case and win. I explained to them that they shall serve as a role model of initiators of seeking justice, the entities involved may be penalized, and the officers and personnel (respondents) may have criminal records. Furthermore, it shall serve as a fitting education for people to know that justice could indeed be served, and that will be a source of tremendous hope for animal lovers. Lastly, one asked what will happen to the fine should there be a favorable decision, they were advised that the amount will go to the government.

Cats of BGC representatives need not file the complaint in the group’s name since they are not SEC-registered, however, any citizen, as an individual, can file a complaint, solely or as a group, and they shall be regarded as “People of the Philippines” in a criminal case.

The representatives of Cats of BGC informed me that they are dependent on CARA on what course of action to take. One of them states this in the group discussion: “I personally just do not want to sign the said affidavit after learning the implications and the end result we would be aiming for should we go that way.”

The ORIGINAL FB POST REPORTER.

Incidentally, Marcelle was at the park at the same time that I met the representatives of the Cats of BGC. I approached him and asked, to this effect -- if he is willing to give justice to the cats, being the individual who has personal experience with them, and act as complainant in the case.

His response was that, like the Cats of BGC representatives, his future actions will be reliant on the decisions of CARA. Meanwhile, at the moment, he will join any search for the “relocated” cats and added that he is hopeful since there are cases when cats are found even 6 months later.

CARA WELFARE PHILIPPINES STATEMENTS.

As of last statement of CARA on February 22, 3:18pm, it states:

“As mentioned last night, the FINAL ROUND OF SEARCHES will be done today in the locations previously stated. . .

“We believe that the most productive thing for us to do right now is to channel our emotions towards finding solutions to the current situation. THE PARTIES INVOLVED ARE COOPERATING AND ARE TRANSPARENT WITH THE INFORMATION THEY ARE PROVIDING. Please allow us to continue handling this situation and first resolve the searches today. . . [emphasis supplied]

“We ask for your continued support and patience. We will continue to work on the PRIMARY GOAL OF LOCATING THE CATS, and again, the team asks for everyone’s prayers. We will update as soon as we can.” [emphasis supplied]

In the previous statement of CARA on February 21, 9:10pm, it states:

“2. SHANGRI-LA MANAGEMENT CONFIRMED THAT 13 CATS, not 11, were taken by Pest Busters. Details on the exact dates and the exact number of cats per day are as follows — [emphasis supplied]

Jan 31 - 8 cats released in Brgy. Buting
Feb 1 - 2 cats
Feb 3 - 1 cat
Feb 6 - 1 cat
Feb 12 - 1 cat

“All Feb cats were released in Anastacio Street.”

“5. Pest Busters was asked to relay how they went about relocating the cats —
They first called ANOTHER ANIMAL WELFARE ORGANIZATION (THEY DID NOT IDENTIFY THEMSELVES AS A PEST CONTROL SERVICE) and asked if they could take the cats. The organization has expressed that they had no room and are currently operating beyond maximum capacity.
THEY THEN CALLED TAGUIG CITY POUND and were told that they could only accept 2 cats every 2 weeks.
THIS IS WHEN PEST BUSTERS DECIDED TO JUST RELOCATE THE CATS THEMSELVES —
The first 8 cats were picked up and placed in cages and then taken to Buting via taxi. The Anastacio cats were hand-carried in cages to the location. . . [emphasis supplied]

“6. Pest Busters has expressed that THEY ARE TRULY SORRY FOR WHAT THEY DID. They were clueless when it came to handling this situation, IT WAS AN AD HOC, A ONE-OFF, because Shangri-La requested them for assistance. . .

“7. Pest Busters was informed that they are IN VIOLATION OF IRR 10631 (ABANDONMENT). They condoned, saying that they had no permit from BAI to transport small animals. . .

“8. Pest Busters continued to apologize. In their words, “We are truly very sorry for what happened. We did what WE THOUGHT WAS OUR BEST WITH GOOD INTENTIONS. We thought we were doing the right thing. We acted on our best knowledge that was not good enough. WE TRIED TO ACT PROFESSIONALLY. We are determined to make it right.” They said they should have told Shangri-La that they don’t do this service.” [emphasis supplied]

MEANWHILE, in reply to comments directed at CARA Welfare Philippines asking for updates on the efforts to seek justice for the cats of BGC, this is their copy-pasted statement: 
“Good day. Thank you for your patience. We are still consolidating information after the final round of searches conducted last Thursday. Kindly standby for our official statement. Thank you!”

NEED FOR GENUINE JUSTICE.

FROM THE STATEMENTS CARA, on speaking for Shanri-la and PestBusters, the lack of explicit next step, after the final round of searches have been conducted, could very well be an indication that things have already been wrapped up as far as the active search for the 13 ‘RELOCATED’ (nay, ABANDONED) cats of BGC are concerned.

THEREFORE, technically, WE HAVE NOT GIVEN JUSTICE TO THE 13 CATS of BGC. PLEASE NOTE that by the absence of their whereabouts does not constitute a lack of probable cause, since this is not a case of violation of Section 6 (CRUELTY, MALTREATMENT OR NEGLECT) of the Animal Welfare Act. RATHER, the REPEATED ACTS (NOT ONCE BUT FIVE TIMES) alone constitutes a violation of Section 7 (ABANDONMENT). For all we care, they might already been poisoned, incinerated and/or buried.

AT THE MOMENT, nobody involved, or directly concerned with the cats, wants to act as complainant. 
People would rather waste their energy on barking and cursing, and turn to social media to popularize unpunished offenders. BUSINESS (WITH IMPUNITY) AS USUAL, . . . BACK TO NORMAL. Lost cats are shall now be forgotten . . . while new cats have already moved in to replace them. There will always be plenty of them anyway. . . MOVING ON to the next animal welfare concern to waste energy on. Wait, there is another case in UP to once again undertake another angry routine and experience another desperate cycle for the so-called animal lovers TO WATCH ANOTHER EPISODE OF A TRAGIC TELENOVELA OF ANIMAL ABUSE EPIC DRAMA.

HAVE THE CULPRITS LEARNED THEIR LESSON? OF COURSE, YES.
HAVE THEY STOPPED THEIR HABITUAL ACTS OF ANIMAL ABUSE? CERTAINLY NOT.
They are now even more cautious, and cunning, and canny, that it would be harder for animal lovers to catch them or even notice.

IF representatives from Cats of BGC, or the reporter of original post, who have personal experience with, and the publicly acknowledged caretakers of, these cats, are not interested to act as complainants and witnesses, then the next logical entities are the SEC-registered parties to the meetings with Shangri-la and PestBusters – the CARA Welfare Philippines and the PHILIPPINE DOGS AND CATS RESCUERS ASSOCIATION INC. (PDCRAI).

On FEBRUARY 17, 12:27pm, PDCRAI founder Marlon S. Gregorio addressed me in our GC, Justice For Shangrila The Fort BGC Cats: “[ ] can you help us file a case? My group is an SEC registered association Philippine Dogs and Cats Rescuers Association, Inc.”

MEANWHILE, I would like to acknowledge the kind words challenge of Madam Nancy H. Cu Unjieng, President of CARA Welfare Philippines, on February 21, 7:07 am, when she messaged me: “We truly appreciate your concern and help Norman. This meeting with PB today is only for CARA volunteers set up by Shang. We shall keep your pointers in mind and I will update you after the meeting. You have come up with important information and hope you continue with your investigation to bring justice for the Shang BGC cats and give due punishment for those involved in this most cruel issue.”

In addition to the above organizations, we are encouraging individuals who have personal experiences with the cats of BGC to COME FORWARD AND HELP ENSURE GENUINE JUSTICE for the abandoned and lost cats of BGC.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE IN READING THIS.

Pagpalo sa mga bata. Tama nga ba?,"Proud to say I'm a battered child. Here's my story goes.

My Grandpa was a retired military officer. Sobrang strict niya sa mga anak niya. Pero yun Papa ko once lang napalo. Lahat nga mga brothers and sister niya literal na mata lang walang latay. Pero sa lahat ng magkakapatid, yun Papa nag-adapt nun gruesome method ng "" palo "" . And to make the story much interesting, amplified version yun discipline niya.

Almusal, tanghalian, merienda, minindal, siesta, dinner, at midnight snack buntal naransan ko lahat. And to think na disciplined na kami, munting pagkakamali lintik na buntal ang kapalit.

2nd ako sa magkakapatid. I have my ate and yun brother kong sumunod sakin. Lahat kami binili ng mga wristwatch na synchronized yun time sa relo niya. Di ka pwedeng magdahilan about the battery if ma-late kasi weekly checked niya if ok pa yun battery nun relo. Eto sample rules and the punishment we received.
 1.Bawal ma-late ng uwi. Not even a minute. Sabay sabay dapat kakain and nakatoka yun mag-sasay ng grace before we eat. Minsan na late ako ng uwi ( project sa school ), sa takot kong mabuntal. Sinama ko classmates and teacher ko. Nakatayo na sa may front door si Papa, and when my teacher explained yun reason. Lumabas ng gate Papa, no uttered words. Kinulyaran ako, sabay batok ng malakas, subsob ako sa front door namin, instant spaghetti sauce yun labi ko nun tumama dun sa handle. Di na naka-imik teacher ko. Isa lang sinabi ni Papa nun. Next time teacher wag niyo ng ihahatid to ha. Ako ng susundo sa kanya. Kala ko tapos na appetizer lang pala yun. ( happened when I was in grade 2 )
 
Punishment... Pag-upo ko para kumain, ayun habang kumakain ka, binabatukan ka. Tapos you will see your mother, walang magawa para tulungan ka. She can only shed tear. Tsk awang awa ako sa sarili ko nun. To make things worst. I have offended another rule while being punished dun sa pagiging late ko.
 1.Pag-kakain, dapat kain lang. Kailangan "" clean plate "". Since binabatukan ako dahil nga na-late ako. Ayun may nahulog na grain of rice out of my plate. When I was about to pick it up. ' Blammmm "" sa lakas nun batok sakin, subsob nanaman yun face ko sa plate ko. And he literally, send the plate flying so lahat nun laman nun sumabog na sa sahig.
 
Punishment... I have to put my hands behind my back and eat every last bit of food sa sahig. Talo ko pa manok sa pagkain kasi patapos na sila kumain dapat matapos na din ako. That time pag-uminit na ulo ni Papa, di na siya kakain and di ka niya tatantanan. Di ka maktulog nun when you are sent to bed, and to console me sa nangyari, in the middle of the night, alam ni Mama na umiiyak ako. She will only go to our room just to kiss me in my forehead, and away she goes. Gusto ko siya tawagin and beg to stay with me until I fell asleep, kaso di pwede. Paga na yun labi ko and sobrang hapdi na.
 1.Bawal maging hero. Since I consider yun araw araw na sinturon, lahat ng klase ng walis and hanger ay minor lang. I will narrate nalang yun worst whoppin'. Basta konting mistake very little lang talaga, gulpi ka na agad, kasi who would dare na gumawa ng kalokohan kung ang kapalit nun eh a week of recovery. back to rule#3. One time, thesis ng Ate ko, she was late for dinner. Like the rule stated above buntal din siya. Ayun pinunit yun report niya, the thesis itself. Almost a month work ni Ate napunit lang in an instant. Tapos habulang buntal ang naganap. Di ko na matiis, since sa lahat ng magkakapatid na-immune nako sa sakit ng katawan, sa buntal, sa gulpi, sa bugbog. Nun nakahawak ng antique chair si Papa para ibato sa Ate ko since ambilis niya tumakbo, 'alam kong tatamaan yun sis ko. Ayun, ako humarang. Sobrang sakit and ramdam na ramdam ko nun tumama sa shoulder blade ko yun upuan. Di ko magalaw right arm ko. Next thing I knew.
 
Punishment... Ayun sabi sakin "" Ah, gusto mo ikaw ang masaktan ha? Bibigyan kita ng sakit "". Parang sinentensyahan nako ng deathrow nun. Dinibdiban ako, sikmura, and that time highschool nako. May batuta siya, gift from Grandpa. Yun lumang batuta, PC daw yun eh ( Philippine Constabulary ) yun ang hinataw sakin. Bawal tumakbo, bawal umiyak or umatungal. Di ko kayang maluha, hirap pigilin. Magaling pumalo si Papa. dahil di kita mga pasa ko pag suot ko school uniform. so yun pasa ko, korteng uniform. Pag nakahubad ako, parang naka-polo ako na kulay blue violet.
 1.I forgot na yun reason kung bakit ako nabuntal. Since very minor lang talaga para maalala ko pa yun dahilan. Pero here's one of the worst punishment.
 
Punishment... Siguro napagod na yun kamay kabubuntal kasi nakita niya na hindi nako nasasaktan. One time sabi niya..."" Lumayas kana, at pag lumabas ka na ng gate. Kalimutan mo ng anak kita at wag na wag ka ng babalik...Alis!!!"" quote and un-quote. So ako natuwa na, palabas nako. confident ako na maraming kukupkop samin kasi nga yun mga kapit-bahay namin awang awa samin kapag naririnig yun buntalan moments. And since sobrang sipag namin, raised and born in military way. Lahat ng gawin namin magkakapatid, we have to make sure it has to be perfect or else...kaya respeto sa nakakatanda, ingat sa mga gamit and toys 9 we barely play our toys kasi onting gasgas, or may maputol an kamay or ulo ( lego ) tsk tsk, alam na. back to the story, I was about to exit our front door. Bigla akong sinigawan, "" Pu%8#!na ka!!!, san ka pupunta ka? "" ngali-ngali kong sabihin na "" Ah, eh sa labas po...pinapalayas niyo po ako diba? "" pero siyempre..ala komiks mode na enclosed lang sa ulap yun thoughts na yun kundi sasabog nanaman nguso ko. Sabi sakin.."" Ipinanganak ka ng Mama mo ng walang damit, aalis ka sa pamamahay ko ng walang dala na kahit na ano."" Gusto ko ng mamatay that time. ( grade 6 ) ako nun, tuli nako pero pano ako lalabas ng naka-hubo?

The event happened when there was a heavy rainfall. Liliw yun place namin and if anyone has ever been there, mataas yun lugar na yun and the little cozy town was previously called "" little baguio "". So sobrang lamig that time, freezing cold plus the rainfall. No choice ako, so tanggal damit. Tinira ko brip ko, I was about to open the handle...biglang... "" Nakakaintindi ka ba? Pag sinabi kong hubo..HUBO!!! "" and believe me, it wasn't even a shout. It was roar, roar from hell. Yun tipong send chills to your bones. Ayun, hubo mode nako. Siyempre ayoko lumabas. That happened around 12:30 pm. Nun elem days eh, we had to go home to eat our lunch then balik ng school. So if lalabas ako, bukod sa lamig and ulan na malakas...makikita ako for sure ng mga kaklase ko. 

"" Labas!!! "" and that was out. I was out cold and I ran and ran. Nakapikit ako, I was praying na pagdilat ko, panaginip lang lahat pero hindi. Good thing 20-25meters across sa house namin ay bakanteng lote with wild grass that stood approximately 3ft. Ayun nagtago ako behind da bushes. No trees to shed me from the rainfall. My hands and feet went numb sa sobrang lamig. I closed my eyes and prayed na maging ibon nalang ako ( kaya naiiyak ako dun sa Forrest Gump, yun scene with Jinny, childhood bestfriend niya na inaabuso nun dad, she prayed to have wings ) or maging hayop nalang ako, mabura na lahat ng memory ko. Grabe mga tumatakbo sa isip ko nun that time. As I kept my eyes closed, I heard a voice. Like an angel's. When I opened my eyes, ayun sumambulat sakin. Two of my girl classmates. To make the story worst, yun isa crush ko. Nun nakita ko sila, they are both crying, naaawa siguro. Lam na kasi sa school yun pambubugbog samin so alam nila na parusa yun sakin. Yun crush ko di nagsasalita, nakatingin lang siya sakin, sa katawan ko.. hehehe...that time todo yupyop ako para di makita yun tweety bird ko ( sobrang lamig kasi eh, what do you expect )

The other girl her name is Kristine, she told me na "" Huy, sama kana samin. Uwi ka sa bahay. May damit don. may pagkain. Dun kana muna magpalipas ng ulan, kami na bahala kay Ma'am ( teacher ). "" Gusto ko na ayaw ko. pano ko tatayo? grade 6...tsk tsk..sabi ko umuna nalang sila and baka makita pa sila ni Papa, madamay pa sila. So on they went. Worst day and night of my life. I fell asleep, siguro sa gutom, and lamig. Ayun, sight na di ko malilimutan till this very day, I saw my Mom held a flash light and heading towards my location. She brought a blanket, nun makita ako, napahawak nalang siya sa bibig niya. Trying to hide her sobs. Ayun lang sabi niya "" Halika na Anak, tulog na Papa mo "" T'was 9pm. Taas na ng lagnat ko. I recovered after a week, ayun back to buntalan moments nanaman for such tiny mistakes. mahal na mahal ako ng Papa ko... 

Even nun college, ligaw moments na. Bugbog sarado kapag late muwi dahil sa GF. Up until now she still remember na ako yun di mapakali kapag nanliligaw ako sa kanya. I sue to tell her na.."" Una nako ha, talo ko pa kasi si Cinderella , pag nalate ako eh yun mukha ko magiging kalabasa sa pasa "" Pag na-late ready na katawan ko sa bugbugan blues. The next day, pag punta ko kila GF. She use tend to my wounds. Sabi ko ok lang yun...minsan kapag trouble sa school. Ayaw na makipag-away sakin kasi nga kapag nakikipagsuntukan ako, yun parang wala nakong paki-elam. Di nako nasasaktan eh, yun pananakit nila eh wala ng epekto or hindi ko na na-fee-feel yun pag-inflict nila ng physical damage. Tapos all-out ako makipag-basagan ng mukha. Buti nalang la naging mga peklat sa mukha ko...

My Dad was proud only at one thing, di siya nagagalit na malalaman niya na nakipagsuntukan ako, pag uwi ko he sees my face bruised, lips are cut. He'll only ask one thing. "" Nasaktan ka? siguraduhin mong nasa tama ka. Labhan mo na yan damit mo, magagalit nanay mo pag nakitang may dugo yan "" and this was grade3 or grade 4.

Madami pang story ang nangyari until nun college nako. We were asked to write an essay. Madaming topic to choose from pero isa yun pinili ko. "" The most memorable person ""

Typically, I should have wrote my mom. Pero instead I wanted to be different. I wrote my dad instead. The composition of the letter was very ironic. I wrote halos kapareho nun post ko dito lahat nun pambubugbog niya, pero nilagay ko sa latter part nun letter. Never akong nagalit or nag-rebelde sa Dad ko. But I always kept on asking one and always the same question...."" Why?""

nilagay ko yun irony nun mga ginawa sakin like...

through tears I learn to smile through pain I learn to love through hate I learn compassion through the bruises I learn to hug and make people smile through the cuts I learn to care and to mend broken hearts

things like that yun sinulat ko sa last part. And my dad thus made me this way, I'll never forget him and he's the most memorable person. Who molded me, creating me of who I am.

Balewala sakin yun, gusto ko lang isulat yun past ko. Tapos di ko one day, our Prof came into our room with tears in her eye. She told us about the essay she asked us to do. Eh gags ako nun sa school. I teased pa na ang cheesy naman nun nagpaiyak kay Ma'am. She then blurted out my name and yun piece ko. She ask me to read it in front of the class. Natatawa pa ko and reasoned na Ma'am seryoso kayu? So ayun, no choice but to read it, Read it as fast as I could, I put no feelings when I read out the words. Nun matatapos na, saw my fellow students...teary eyed. Upo lang ako, and my Prof asks for my permission if she could get a copy. sabi ko no prob. Ayun ang dami nila nagpa-photocopy, mostly mga babae. Di pa natapos story nun, paguwi ko ng bahay, a month passed ata. when I was about to leave our house for another week for school ( sa manila nako nag-cocollege that time ) my dad held my shoulders and said... "" May naiwan ka na yellow pad, assignment niyo ata "" isip ako ng sip kung anu yun until he said na "" Memorable person yun title "".. he looked into straight into my eye, as if he has seen my soul. Gusto kong pumikit that time and sabi ko patay, the worst thing could ever happened already did happened. He then said softly.. "" h'wag ka umalis, mag-uusap tayu...""

My Dad told me to stay for the day, and ok lang daw na umabsent ako sa class. Di ko lam kung ano dapat maramdaman ko that time. Pinagpapawisan ka ng butil butil na malamig, kahit maaliwalas naman ang panahon. He then ask me to buy "" Lambanog "" and some pulutan. That time ang tumatakbo sa isip ko, na iinom siya mag-isa and pagna-reach na yun super saiyan level saka ako hahagupitin, dahil dun sa pesteng essay na yun na hindi ko lam how the hell he obtain that?? I prepared my body for the torture of my life. And there he was, we have a bahay kubo at our backyard, I got the drinks and then he called me up. It wasn't even a call, more of like a "" pakiusap "". he told me. "" Halika dito, maguusap tayu. "" First time I've heard that tone of voice, it was very meek. Aaminn ko, that time mas napraning ako dahil iba yun mood niya. Di ko lam kung paglapit koba eh, bigla nalang ako hatawin nun bote or what. Very cautious ako that time. Di ako umiimik. Then he spoke. "" Inom tayung dalawa. "" First time he ever asked me to have a sitdown with him. One on one. Miinom nako that time, pero not with him. Not that kind of setting. He told his life story, how he was raised up when he was a child. Ako yun nag-tatagay that time. Gusto ko talaga dayain. Ayokong magulpi ng naka-inom ako, di ko lam magiging reaction ko. I was afraid na baka gumanti ako pag binira ako, pero mas natakot ako kasi for sure pag nakainom ako, di ako makakailag sa uppercut, jab, roundhouse and sa fatality. Parang mortal kombat lang. The conversation went smooth, hours have passed. My mom watches us from a distance, maybe preaparing for a bloodbath. I was surprised my Dad, forgot na yun essay thing... 

But I was wrong. He reached down to his pocket. Pulled out th letter. Stared at me. And then asked me to read it. My mom rushed and sat right next to me. My angel my guradian. Thought came passing through my head, I am saved. 

My Dad told my Mom, "" Makinig tayu. "" Inabot na niya yun well-folded na yellow pad. And then I read it. May part dun na sinadya kong hindi basahin. How can I read it? Andun yun "" memorable person "" sa harap ko. Kapag binasa ko yun, 100% yun ang magiging "" memorable gulpi "" ko. My father spoke, gulat na gulat ako. When I skipped a sentence. he told me.. "" Basahin mo lahat, gusto kong marining lahat. Every word you wrote. Read it. ""... I froze and pumasok na sa isip ko that time. He already read it, probably over and over. La nakong magagawa I have to fully read it. I heard my mom crying. I found myself tears falling down my eye. When I made the letter, I made that out of sadness. Emotions came rushing in. And when I read the final words. I looked up at my Dad. His eyes kept closed. I saw tears falling from the corners of his eyes.

Is this a dream? I came to question myself? Siguro I was drunk??

My Dad spoke, his voice was trembling. His eyes still closed. "" The sweetest words I could hear from my son. I never dreamed that I will live the day to hear these words. "" He opened his eyes and said... "" Maraming salamat...anak. I want you to read that sa burol ko. Kapag namatay ako, I want everybody to know what kind of a father I was. "" The most sad thing I ever heard from him. Masahol pa yun naramdaman ko nun nakipag-break up yun GF ko. My heart was shattered. I don't want to see that, I don't want to hear those words from him. Mga profanity, mga pagmumura niya sakin...that I can endure pero yun words na he told me. How he felt bout the letter. I wish I hadn't wrote it. My father's words broke my heart apart. My fear pala is I don't want to see my Dad in pain. Seconds passed, pero it felt like days. My childhood life flashed before my eyes, and then yun questoin ko was answered.

My Dad looked upon my Mom and said. "" Mi, sabihin mo lahat sa kanya, I wanted him to know everything. Gusto ko sa lahat ng magkakapatid siya nalang yun makaalam. "" My mother held and squeezed my hand..and then she told me everything.

"" Mahal na mahal kayung lahat ng Papa mo. Gusto niya na matuto kayung maging matibay sa lahat ng bagay at hindi basta basta bibigay o susuko. Lahat ng mapait at masakit pinatikim niya sa inyo, dahil wala ng mas mananakit pa inyo kung hindi yun taong nagmamahal sa inyo at yun ang Papa niyo. Nagusap kami ng Papa mo, we had an agreement. He will be hated and I ( my mom ) will be loved. He will die na alam niya galit kayung magkakapatid sa kanya pero nabago yun dahil sa sulat mo. Nalaman niya na hindi ka galit sa kanya. Hindi niyo lang alam kung gano kayu kamahal ng Papa niyo. Tuwing gabi bago kayu matulog, matapos niya kayung paluin. Siya yun unang nag-aalala s inyo, uutusan niya ako na puntahan kayu sa kwarto niyo para i-check at gamutin mga sugat niyo. Tuwing may pinapalayas sa inyo, siya yun nag-uutos sakin na hanapin kayu. Ang Papa niyo ang nag-aalala sa lahat, siya ang hindi makatulog kapag wala pa kayu sa bahay. Siya ang nagpapahanda ng pagkain kapag alam na pauwi na kayu. Kaya wag niyong iisipin na sa lahat ng pamamalo niya hindi ko kayu tinulungan. Ang gusto ng Papa niyo ay matuto kayung lahat, he will die happy knowing na hindi siya kahit kailan nagkulang ng pangangaral sa inyo. How hard it is for him everytime hinahataw kayu. Ang totoo niyan siya ang umiiyak sa gabi. And he let me do the explanation sa inyo kung bakit kayu napalo. All he wanted is to have his children learn how to stand up on their own. Ayaw na ayaw niya na maging hangal kayu katulad nun mga kapatid niya. At alam niya, na minsan dadating sa buhay niyo, kapag wala na siya. Lahat kayung magkakapatid ma-rerealize that all along your father was right. ""

All fluids naglabasan sa mata and sa ilong ko. Nasagot lahat ng tanong ko. My father asked me to keep those words within ousrselves and he asked me to tell it to my sister especially my brother when the time is right. He also made me promise to read the letter sa funeral niya.

To end the very akward moment. My father cracked a joke... "" Akin na yang yellow pad, ako na magtatabi. Mababasa pa ng uhog mo eh. "" We all laughed and ended the night with forgiveness.

Next day I'm like a new person, parang nakawala sa hawla. Di ko ma-explain, it is like being born again.

Ayun lang po yun story ko. Salamat sa mga matiyagang nagbasa. Me and my dad are best friends today. Every weekend umuuwi ako sa Laguna, and palagi kami umiinom dalawa. Lahat ng values and principles he imparted sakin and he always wish for me to take care of my younger brother na I will lead him to the right path. Lumayas na kasi siya and never returned home. Minsan we talked nun brother ko, I talk sense into him pero it's very hard for him to accept. He endured every puinishment with hatred kaya ayun, he never wanted to go home. I'm still praying na before my Dad's time I will be able to ask my brother to see him the last time.

Pa, salamat sa palo mo.

**EDIT: TL;DR** 
Nagpapasalamat ako at ginulpi ako nun bata pa ako



**UPDATE:** I wish I could reply to all your questions and rebutt  to your opinions (logically) being thrown around but it'll really take time for me to do so and for that I apologize. I hope I can shed light at the very least and hope to answer some of the queries below. Believe me, I was really overwhelmed by your comments and I thank you all for it. 

I wrote this piece 7years ago in an online forum as well. There is a comment below that asked about it and yeah jpatricks1, I'm the same guy. I hadn't edited it since and it's funny to read it myself again relieving the moment I wrote it ages ago and I really sucked at writing at that time. Why did I even share it here in the first place you might ask? 

It was my father's birthday last monday and a flash of memories came upon me when I was a child and I thought of sharing this story to you guys. For the reason that most,if not all, forumers here in reddit are straight to the point and open minded people. I have no intention at all  to set this an example for any other parents or soon to be parents out there to think that abusing their child/children is okay so long as there is a stupid one to accept it and think that it is the only way to endure the pain and suffering the world has to offer. 

I'm an adult right now and a father to two as well. I have always burned in my mind that never my children will suffer the same way that I did. I scold them from time to time and explain them things that should and shouldn't be. I leave it for them to decide for themselves but I tell them exactly the consequences for their actions. I have spanked them one or two occassions but during those event I'm terrified at my own self, repeating the horrors of my past. My eldest is 8 and napalo ko siya I think not more than three times and I've used a pangkamot sa likod to pat his butt as controlled as I could, maybe a 0.00001 version of my Dad's. Afterwhich I have explained why I have to do that pamamalo. 

I've shared a part of my life. Take note, just a part. The totality of my person being has already been questioned here because of that tiny part in my life that I have shared. My father and my mother raised us as best as they could and what they see fit. I can't blame them. They have their own reasons and if their conscience can handle the fact that they hurt they own offspring, it is really not for me to tell. I can only tell you the part of which I understand them why would they have to resort to that kind of parenting.

It may seem all too surreal that I have accepted the fact that it is okay with me being brutally abused, but it is not. The story of my beating have been told in a narrative way to inspire fellow beaten child that one have endured, to send a message that beating is not the answer. That all suffering has an ending that might turned out good. There are a lot of quetions in your mind that may arise about what might OP thinks or what has he become. Let me tell you this, you do not look at the blank wall and just see the dot. Focusing yourself and get lost in the dot which is a just part of the wall. 




You look at the goddamn wall itself.

Why is it a trend to discredit and make fun of men being vulnerable? [TRIGGER WARNING: SUICIDE],"Three times more men than women die from suicide every day. According to some data, women are more likely to attempt suicide, but men are more likely to succeed in doing so because they attempt suicide through more extreme ways. It's most likely men are at their absolute breaking point when they do attempt it.

Masculinity has always been at the root of the problem. Men have always been told that they have to be tough and that being emotional about their feelings is a no-no. This is a teaching that has been instilled in men for generations and it should be forgotten. The seed of this toxic thinking has stopped the majority of men from seeking help that could have saved them from their own selves.

With this being said, to cry for help is already a huge leap for the majority of men but somehow we have come up with a way to make it harder for them. Men also have the fear now to call for help or be emotional, lest they will be branded as a 'sadboi' and get ridiculed for it. That is not right or funny at all. We are losing lives that could have easily been saved, and what do we do? We ridicule them for being brave and vulnerable. 

We are just adding to the problem of toxic masculinity. We are the generation that is supposed to break these stupid norms. We are the ones fighting for gender equality. How can we lobby for men to dress more openly regardless of their gender identification, and be this stupid to make fun of them being emotional? As much as women can be the providers of a home and tough, men can also be vulnerable and emotional. This type of thing should not be looked at as cool and be accepted as this edgy form of a meme. 

I can get that there are really a few that can really qualify as a 'manipulative sadboi' to get sympathy from women. But it is never a good idea to generalize it. It's the same idea with men being afraid to be all lovey-dovey to their partners. We always see these memes about a guy being scared to say ""I love you"" to their partners in front of their 'tough' guy friends. Apparently to show affection to a woman in any gravity or way can also be branded as 'simping'. That's dumb yes, but that still isn't on the same gravity of my original point. We are talking about saving some lives just by listening to them. 

Last month, a friend of the family died through suicide. As with almost every case of suicide, no one thought he was having a tough time. His family and his children didn't know anything was bugging him as he seemed fine. They are not rich, but they are not also struggling from any financial problems and yet he killed himself. This is an older guy, in his 50s. Apparently he went to his parent's graves probably for one last goodbye and he shot himself then and there. There is no doubt in my mind that he also wanted to cry for help, but didn't. I hope when we are older, we tackle mental health issues better for the sake of people struggling like him. We have to be more open and accepting instead of edgy and sassy. Because the young men that we are ridiculing for showing emotion could well be someone's father and husband someday and the seed the we are yet planting in this day and age in a form of a stupid edgy meme can last for years. We gotta make it easier for everyone to seek help. Instead of joining in on a stupid meaningless joke, why not tell them that it will get better? A simple message instead of a meaningless tease can go a long way for someone who's life is only hanging by a thread.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/mgqbgl/why_is_it_a_trend_to_discredit_and_make_fun_of/,t2_473boua9,2021-03-31 05:20:07,38
Verbally abusive parent. How do you cope with it?,"Just a quick background on myself: I'm in my 20s and I'm still dependent on my parents. 

My father tends to verbally abusive towards my siblings and I. Super stressed sa work pero yung anger na hindi namin deserve, sa amin niya linalabas. Kahit anong mura pa yan sabayan ng sobrang insultong mga salita. Yung tipong manliliit talaga paningin mo sa sarili mo. Hindi ko na kinaya today, I fought back and told him na hindi tama yung ginagawa niya. Ang sabi niya, ""it's for our own good and we need it to be strong."" Tangina? Magiging strong kami in what expense? Strong nga pero may hatred kami for him, ganun ba yun? Also, he told me that I do not know the pressure of handling a big company, kaya ganun na lang talaga siya. Para bang take it or leave it, that's who I am. Tanginang rason yan. Sorry, guys. Hindi ko na alam kung saan ako magsseek out ng help for this matter, kaya dito ko na lang sa reddit naisipan. 

Any advice on how to cope/deal with this situation? We live in the same house so most probably makikita ko pa rin siya on a daily basis. Hindi ko lang alam kung paano ko siya icoconfront ulit without my voice shaking or na obviously galit sa kanya. He's been like this for quite sometime na. Pero today's the day I decided na tama na yung ginagawa niya. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/7l35gl/verbally_abusive_parent_how_do_you_cope_with_it/,t2_nr7ok04,2017-12-21 02:08:18,18
Too ashamed to admit that I'm being abused as a guy and too scared to do anything about it.,"Hi everyone. Just a disclaimer, I'm not posting this to gain some pity. I simply want to lay out my story before I break down. It's your prerogative to judge whether you will believe if any of this is true.

My story started about more than a year ago. I was an OFW and flew back to the Philippines for a quick Christmas and  New Year's break (2019 - before covid). It was a surprise visit for my parents which I haven't seen in almost 2 years. Please take note that I've never been back to the Philippines for more than 10 years. I usually go on a trip with my folks every 2-3 years outside the Phils.

Being it as a surprise, I didn't went back to my hometown for a few days as I wanted to surprise them on Christmas eve. I booked a hotel in Manila near the casino and MOA for a few days. 

Knowing that I'll probably spend some days by myself, boredom got to me and I tried out Tinder - just for fun (I was single then, fyi). Got a few good matches - weeding out some catfish, fakes, and ""service providers"" -  and tried out meeting  with some of them.

Then, I got matched with this one girl. We decided to meet just for a drink. When we met, she brought her own car to drive us around. Since I'm not really familiar about the watering holes in Manila, I let her decide where to go. I told her to ""surprise"" me. We actually had a great night. We bonded, laughed, got a few drinks, and ended up back to my hotel. Needless to say, I had a great time and for someone who I just met on a dating to turn out to be such a catch - and so I thought.

We kept in touch after that. Went out for dinner a couple of times after that and everything was great. Got to know her a bit more. She's a recruitment manager at one of the top call centres here in the Philippines. That info alone got me really excited. She has already achieved so much, independent, and acted very sophisticated around that time. I thought, on a very rare case, that I found the one by sheer luck - on a dating app of all places. Call me naive now. I'm thinking the same, too.

Christmas eve came. The time had come for me to check out and surprise my family. We both decided to meet again after NYE. I was over the moon during the holidays. After spending NYE in Boracay with my folks, I checked in to a hotel in Manila a few days before my flight. We met a couple of times during that time. I'm aware that LDR does not work - at all. Still, on my last night, we decided to give it a go.

Back abroad (I will not provide the actual country. Since she or her family might recognize that this is me), we kept in touch and everything was going well. I actually planned to surprise her by going back to the Philippines after a few months. Really looked forward to it. Then, covid happened. So, plans changed and I have to wait for a flight to be available back to the Phils. As I waited, I kept hope alive. I already have an apartment in Eastwood waiting for us. I've been working at home pre-covid and doing well for myself so I thought giving us a chance back in the Phils should be just fine. Besides, of she's actually the one then the gamble will pay off. I was ecstatic.

July 2020. Finally got a flight back home. Can't even sleep on my way back. Got quarantined for a few days. Once that's all done, I was counting the minutes while in a cab to meet her again. Our reunion was great and exceeded all of my expectations. We spent being on lockdown in our new place. Everything was perfect. When they eased the lockdown, I met some of her relatives. I immediately felt that I belonged. We shared drinks, got invited to their family gatherings, and even hosted their Christmas party last year. I really thought back then that everything was going as great as they can be. I wish I could've known what will happen next.

A few months after that, we found a better place in our neighborhood. It was amazing. We immediately got it and moved in. So, the usual routine. Weekdays, we work at home and got our dinner outside. Weekends, we meet her parents or some of their relatives for a casual drink. Everything went like this until a few days ago..

Don't get me wrong, we've been in a few fights during this. Nothing really serious but I should've seen some signs and ran away as fast as I can. There was an instance where the fight got really bad and she threatened me that she'll hurt herself if I will not stay. I tried stopping her and got my finger clipped by a kitchen scissor in the process. She was in shock (due to the blood all over our floor) and got back to her senses immediately. She apologized and I thought it was just ok as long as she understands that this type of accident wouldn't happen if she'll act more rationally.

I initially thought that her emotional blackmails would stop. They didn't. Only got worse. I tried calming her every single time. The end of our fights is usually the same: We fight, she'll blackmail me, hurt me physically in the process, then we'd make up. I know, I'm an idiot.

This went on. Then just a few days ago, the worst thing happened. We were in her parents house to grab a couple of drinks and chat. They have some guests which I've already met a couple of times before. Out of nowhere, she went to a corner. I asked everyone where she was and I approached her. Asked her what was the problem then she suddenly started a fight. Asking me why I haven't introduced her to my parents yet. So, I answered that we're still new and I want to make sure that we're both sure before that happens. I cared so much about my mum and would like to introduce her only if we're sure where we are going with this. She immediately yelled: ""Well, fuck your mum!"". I whispered and gave her a chance to revert whatever she just said. She might have seen how furious I was and then she yelled: ""Dad, he's gonna hurt me!"". I was stunned. It felt like being wrongly accused of rape. I'm not perfect but I've never hit a girl before. She knew that. How? Because I told her that I'd rather break up with a girl than get violent. I meant that no matter how much they would hit me. I have no qualms with you if you think that this is BS. I'd doubt myself, too. Considering the things I just told you.

Her dad immediately went to us. He asked what's wrong and she said that I was planning to hurt her. Being confused, stunned, and probably in shock - I kept quiet and just lowered my head. Clenching my hands, I was thinking nothing else. I just want to go. I just want to leave her. Then they ganged up on me, her dad, mum, and her. They actually made me feel that I was the bad guy. I can't even remember what they were telling me. I thought I got deaf for a while. All I can hear is white noise and my heartbeat. A few minutes after that, she insisted we go home. Her dad said that she should stay. When I heard that, I got a glimpse of hope to escape. I was thinking of packing my stuff immediately once I get back to our place and go somewhere else. Then, she shouted at her dad that she'd rather drive me home and get back. For some reason, they let her. I'm just done by then.

On our drive back, she kept talking to me but I never understood or heard anything. I was in a daze. All I remembered was that we were already in the underground parking lot. I told her that I want to break up - I'm done. I even begged her if we can deal with this as adults. She went ballistic. Not thinking, I ran out of the car. She got back in the car and chased me in the parking lot. I hid behind some of the parked cars. She kept on shouting like an unhinged person.

A few minutes later, the security guy came out of the elevator. Must have seen us in the cameras. As I don't want to create a scandal, I approached him and told him that she was just drunk. He radioed in that the person with her is there. I got confused. Was I the one they were after? A few seconds later, her dad got out of the elevator with another security guy. I just slumped there realizing what the actual fuck happened. They thought I was gonna hurt her. Her dad even came to her rescue and told me not to hurt her. I can only take so much for a night. 

Helpless, I complied to get back to our condo. Her dad left. I never talked. I never moved once we got back. I know that I'm fucked. When they left, she immediately shouted at me. Forcing me to get back with her. Threatening me that she'll kill herself if I don't. A few slaps here and there. More crying. I guess I don't even know what's going on anymore. 

At that point, I knew I was done. I gave up. But I'm not giving myself up to her whims. She told me again to watch her hang herself. I replied: ""I don't care anymore. Go. My life is over anyway. Nobody would believe me."". She pretended to do it but didn't go ahead with it. After I saw that, I told myself that whatever happens next that I wouldn't care anymore.

She's still here at my place. I refuse to talk to her. I can't leave. Even if there's a small indication that I'm about to leave, she panics. Believe it or not, she actually slept in our door last night just to make sure that I can't leave.

I haven't eaten or taken a shower for a few days now. This is my form of protest. Not sure how long I'll last. Don't pity me, I beg you. I took a gamble. I held unto hope that things will get better. I thought that I can be with someone that I will grow to be with. I have no regrets either way 

Despite this, I would like to thank you for reading my long post. I'm not asking you for anything. Reading this is more than enough.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/lfaeu0/too_ashamed_to_admit_that_im_being_abused_as_a/,t2_4vfmc39o,2021-02-08 20:04:08,201
