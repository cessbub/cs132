Why does no one address male-to-male sexual harassment by gays and transgenders towards men?,"It is silly that I would get downvoted for this but I have suffered numerous sexual harassments in my entire life in the Philippines, as a straight man in the Philippines. I was groped by a gay man in an escalator in Resort's World, I was almost pulled into a cubicle by a gay batchmate in my high school in Zobel, and I was physically held by a transgender dead in the tracks in the Island after drinking with my friends wherein he/she gazed at me like I was a piece of meat unable to let go. Yet, all I hear is fellow Filipinos telling me to suck it up because they are victims themselves, which I do agree, but what about me?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/107679q/why_does_no_one_address_maletomale_sexual/,t2_vh0trtu8,2023-01-09 13:48:41,1796

tw: sexual harassment,"hello, would like to ask opinions since I‚Äôm not knowledgeable with this and I don‚Äôt want to say anything reckless kay girl; 

context: 
female friend was supposed to sleep with female friends, but for some reason she ended up sleeping with a guy friend on her other side (which she told me na parang kapatid nga daw so walang malisya) after a night out ata. Hindi sila lasing nor nakainom, when the guy tried to kiss her, na iniwasan nya then suddenly tried to touch her on a private part which ofc, bumangon na sya. 

Sunday morning ata ‚Äòto nangyari and till now di raw sya makatulog then nung kinwento nya sa friends nya, apparently, touchy at medj manyak daw talaga si guy even sa ibang babae (at may gf pa raw yung guy). She confronted the guy tapos nag sorry etc ‚Äúnatukso‚Äù lang daw so she got receipts na the guy kind of admitted that he really did something. 

Now, she and her friends want to post this online along with her screenshots for awareness lalo na sa mga kakilala nila. Will it be okay to post this in facebook? Am I right, na pwede ‚Äòtong ireklamo legally? Gusto nya kasi magtanda yung guy para hindi na ulitin sa iba.

"Warning: Sexual Harassment, Manyak na Prof","So apparently, may kumakalat na balita tungkol sa isang manyakis umano na prof ng kursong MassCom sa Western Mindanao State University (Zamboanga City). Isa rin umano itong radio anchor sa isang local radio station.

According sa poster, estudyante siya ng nasabing kurso noon sa naturang unibersidad kung saan niya nakilala itong prof na to. Given his history of sexually harassing his students, both former or current, ay naging notorious na ang kalakaran nito among Masscom students. Pero this time, may nagsalita na.

After how many years ng pagkagraduate ay nakatanggap umano si poster ng chat mula sa kanyang prof, kung saan ay tinatanong siya nito ng malalaswang bagay gaya ng kung ano raw ang paborito niyang sex position. Giit pa ng prof, para sa pulse umano ito na ginagawa ng kanilang radio station, but his intention speaks otherwise.

Dahil sa nakikitang intention ay umalma itong si former student pero ginaslight pa siya nito, kaya minabuti niya na ipost nalang ang kanilang naging convo at ang convo pa niya sa iba't ibang mga tao na may similar na kwento kaugnay sa prof. At after niya itong mapost ay marami nang students ang nagsalita tungkol sa mga ginagawa umanong kalaswaan nitong prof.

Bilang isang tagapagmasid sa mga ganitong impormasyon, ay masasabi ko po na talamak ang ganitong mga pangyayari. Actually, May mga ilan pa na kakilala ko ang nagsabi nangyayari umano ang pambabastos, panghaharass ng mga estudyante sa mismong faculty room at classroom nila, sa presensya pa mismo ng kani-kanilang mga department heads. Pero may nagagawa ba? Wala!

May mga ilan-ilan na rin ang nagsumbong sa mga admin tungkol dito pero wala paring aksyon. Bakit? Dahil sa mga koneksyon at pagkakaibigan nila sa mga taong dapat na tumutok sa ganitong mga usapin. May mga iba pa nga na nagbabanta sa mga estudyante na kapag nagsumbong umano sila ay magbubunga raw ito ng repercussions against the students gawa ng mga koneksyon nila. Kaya marami ang takot na magsalita dahil takot silang bumagsak or possibly maexpel sa university (according sa ilang mga threats).

Sa katunayan nga, kung hindi pa nagviral ang post na ito ay wala paring statement na ilalabas ang admin no matter how many attempts ng pagsusumbong sa kanilang opisina.

Ganoon kalala ang mga institusyon natin, ganoon kalala ang sistema. Yung tipong gusto mong ipaglaban ang tama at katarungan pero hindi mo magagawa dahil makukompromiso ang edukasyon mo nang dahil sa mga tao na yan. Aaksyunan nalang nila ang mga ganyang pangyayari pag lumantad na ito sa publiko. Ang masama pa niyan, igagaslight pa nila ang mga estudyante dahil ""bakit ngayon lang sila nagsalita"" when in fact, matagal na nakapile ang tone-toneladang mga complaint sa kanilang opisina.
Alam ko po na common na ito sa iba't ibang unibersidad o paaralan. Pero issues like this should never be silenced.

Ngayon matanong ko po kayo, given these arising issues sa university namin, and possibly may mga ganyan ding pangyayari sa university ninyo: safe space pa ba ang universities/paaralan? Mapagkakatiwalaan pa kaya ang mga prof na may ganitong kalakaran? Magiging ligtas pa ba ang mga estudyante mula sa mga ganitong harassment? At kung magsusumbong tayo ay mapagkakatiwalaan pa kaya natin ang mga opisinang dapat mapagsumbungan?

Kasi kung ako ang tatanungin, palagay ko ay hindi na. Sobra-sobra na. Ang lugar na dapat mapagkuhanan natin ng edukasyon ang magbibigay sa atin ng mapait na leksyon at minsan humahantong ito sa kaligtasan at katinuan ng bawat estudyante. Kaya kung may mga nakararanas ng mga ganitong pambabastos mula sa kani-kanilang prof, panahon na para magsalita. Ang bilang natin ay kailanman hindi matutumbasan ng mga bilang nila!",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1adtp8g,t2_s52k5xag0,2024-01-29 20:01:38,29
Malaca√±ang fires assistant solicitor general for sexual harassment,"An assistant solicitor general (ASG) with a spotty record of sexual harassment has been fired by Malaca√±ang, and while the decision has been appealed, Rappler learned that an officer-in-charge (OIC) has already been appointed to the vacated division in the Office of the Solicitor General.

ASG Derek Puertollano, who is a career official, was dismissed from service over three administrative charges of sexual harassment prompted by a complaint from his legal interns.

‚ÄúThese harrowing incidents left complainants traumatized, scarring them both for life,‚Äù said Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin in his decision dated February 20. He found Puertollano administratively liable for the grave offense of sexual harassment through unwanted touching of private part of the body, and the less grave offenses of sexual harassment through unwanted touching or brushing against a victim‚Äôs body, and through surreptiously looking at a person‚Äôs private part.

Rappler has learned that Puertollano is appealing the decision, but Solicitor General Menardo Guevarra has already appointed an OIC to the vacated legal division. Rappler has sent an email to Puertollano seeking his statement. We will update this story once he responds.

Puertollano was involved in a separate sexual abuse case in 2016, according to reports from Manila Standard and Philippine Star. Based on the reports, he was charged in the US with intent to sexually abuse a minor, an incident that happened during official business when he was attending a seminar on international arbitration.

Evidently, Puertollano was able to keep his job.

The present charges stemmed from the complaint of two male legal interns of the OSG who went with Puertollano in an out-of-town business trip mid-year 2022.

According to the documents, Puertollano maneuvered the hotel room assignments so he could be in the same room as his two interns. One of them complained about Puertollano taking a shower in his full view with the door ajar. When it was the victim taking a shower, Puertollano went to the bathroom despite his protestation and the victim said he felt his boss‚Äô ‚Äúhand brush my butt cheek.‚Äù

The other complained about inappropriate remarks while the ASG looked at his crotch, while following him to the urinal, and while sleeping in separate beds that were pushed together by Puertollano. The ASG was accused of ‚Äútouching [the victim‚Äôs] feet under the covers with own feet‚Äù and ‚Äúplacing [his] hand on [the victim‚Äôs] outer thigh.‚Äù

‚ÄúAll of which was unwelcome and pervasive, and which thereby created an intimidating, uncomfortable and insecure environment,‚Äù read the charges.

In his defense, Puertollano said all of the incidents were not malicious. But in the OSG‚Äôs internal investigation, Guevarra recommended dismissal from service and referred the case to Malaca√±ang.

‚Äú[Victims] were his subordinates or interns whom he exercised control and supervision as supervising ASG. He took advantage of his position and, instead of acting in loco parentis, he was even the one who preyed on them, taking advantage of his superior position,‚Äù said Bersamin.

‚ÄúThis Office emphasizes that bare denials of Puertollano cannot withstand the positive declarations and detailed recounts of the harrowing incidents experienced by [the victims] under his hands,‚Äù the executive secretary said. ‚Äì Rappler.com",https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/inside-track/malacanang-fires-assistant-solicitor-general-for-sexual-harassment/,t2_bw5o88o5c,2024-02-27 13:49:07,30
I just got sexually harassed on MRT,"It's my day off tomorrow so I'm going home to Pampanga. I took the MRT to Cubao. While waiting for my station, listening to Linkin Park, just minding my business, this guy grabbed my junk then inserted his hand in my pants to fondle my junk. I'm wearing jagger pants that's why it was easy for him to put his hand inside. I was so shocked I froze. 

Before that, I already felt something touching my private. I looked down and saw him holding an umbrella so I thought it was just the umbrella touching me so I ignored it. It might have given him the wrong idea. 

Before I was even able to think of anything to do, he was already gone. I just saw him climbing down the stairs.

Sexual Harassment in UP Philcoa Jeep to SM North,"Hi! I'm not sure if this is the right flair for my post, but I hope you will read it until the end. 

This happened yesterday, on **Feb 2, 2023, Thursday, around 3 pm** while I was at a jeep in **Philcoa heading to SM North**. I was sitting next to my mom when this happened. There was this guy in front of us, he was tall with a medium/fat body type, and he was wearing a basic uniform (black t-shirt and black pants with an orange pocket), similar to the uniform of a firefighter or a construction worker while carrying a large black backpack with him. As far as I can remember, he‚Äôs also tan, has dark eyes, and has some white hair as well.

I remember when I looked at him, he was holding his phone up in front of his face, though I didn‚Äôt notice nor realize that he was already taking a video of me. I guess it is also my fault for being oblivious to the situation as it is my first time commuting on a public transpo. **Disclaimer:** My outfit was pretty decent. Hence, regardless of my outfit, it doesn‚Äôt give him the consent to sexualize me, let alone blame me for the situation. In short, *siya ang may problema. Siya ang may malisya.*

Even though he never touched me, taking a video without my consent is already a form of sexual harassment. Buti nalang sinabihan ako ng isang babaeng pasahero na vinideohan daw ako and he even zoomed in on me raw. WTF? However, it‚Äôs already too late for confrontation since that a\*\*hole already left the jeep. And to that kind lady who told me about his despicable act, thank you for doing so since I wouldn‚Äôt be aware of it if you left it unsaid. PERO it could have saved me if you said it earlier, when he was still taking a video of me. Sana sinita mo narin siya when you caught him in the act. But I guess it‚Äôs too late to be a hero, though I understand that you might have been scared as well. 

Anyways, when he already went off the jeep, I remember that he dropped off near SM North‚ÄîI think around the construction site? Basta it‚Äôs an area that has large pillars leading to the footbridge going to SM North (Please correct me in the comments regarding the right term for this area üòÖ). After that, when the lady told me what happened, there was a bit of commotion/reaction in the jeepney, and the driver also said that the guy allegedly works as either a firefighter or a construction worker, presumably near SM North since it is where he went off. So to anyone who might notice this guy based on my description, either in the same area or the same jeepney route, please inform me via DM. If ever you see him taking a video of another girl, I hope you also take the right action and muster up all the courage to confront him.

To that man who took a video of me WITHOUT my consent for whatever sick purpose you have in mind, I hope you rot in hell and get the karma that you deserve. As for my video, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs even that sexual. I was just innocently sitting there, unaware that you were already taking a video of me. *Wala akong ginagawang mali.* So even if you upload it, sino ang may malisya? Ako or ikaw?

Basta ito ang tandaan mo, once I see you again, rest assured that I will get my revenge :)) I have relatives working for the government and I will make sure that you will get caught. This is not a warning, but a threat. Hindi mo alam sino binabangga mo üòâ

To all the women out there who have been victimized by this man or had a similar experience, please stay safe! Let‚Äôs protect each other if you see another woman out there encountering the same situation, or any form of sexual harassment, sexual assault‚Äîwhatever you may call it.

Lastly, to all of you reading this, I hope that you believe my side of the story. This is a real experience and the least that I could be grateful for is that he didn‚Äôt touch me. Pero since he already has a video of my face, God knows what he might do next. All I can do now is take extra precautions to ensure my safety from other *manyaks* to come ü§£

Kidding aside, I hope that you can also help me if ever you encounter this man and if you see him taking a video of another girl. Please confront him, confiscate his phone for evidence, and report him immediately. Unfortunately, I wasn‚Äôt able to take a picture/video of him, but I hope my description would suffice. And to those other passengers in the same jeep that witnessed what happened, you may comment your thoughts or add information on the situation. 

That‚Äôs all. Thank you for taking the time to read this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/10si2im/sexual_harassment_in_up_philcoa_jeep_to_sm_north/,t2_dddq8xfq,2023-02-03 19:25:26,0

my experience with sexual harassment,"hi. i just really need to get this out my chest. earlier, i watched an animation in yt about a little girl who was sexually abused. and the video made my heart ache. when i was a child, i couldn't do anything. i felt so helpless, i couldn't tell anyone about my experience. and until now, i'm still having difficulties to tell my experience to my parents. i really really want to tell them but i'm afraid of how they wouldn't believe me since it all happened to me too young, that it was only a figment of my childhood imagination. but i know it isn't, it felt too real to be an imagination. and it didn't happen once, it happened twice and my tito did it to me. not only that, his brother, that i used to be close with, almost harassed me and it happened last year. i managed to maintain a distance from him but didn't tell my parents the incident since he was drunk and i wanted to understand him because he was one of my favorite titos. i want to speak up, i badly want to, but i'm afraid i would ruin their already ruined family more and i'm also afraid no adult will believe me. up until now, those experiences haunt me. i can still feel everything that my tito did to me. maybe that's the reason why he always gives me money when he sees me up until now. i just hope he doesn't do what he did to me to his daughter considering he has a family now. and that's the other reason why i can't speak up. what if he changed? what if he's a good father and a good husband? i might scar his children for life. i can't do that to my cousins.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/q76c8t/my_experience_with_sexual_harassment/,t2_bqxrp58d,2021-10-13 15:56:03,28

My sister got sexually harassed in a company outing by a fellow coworker. Any advice on what action should we take first?,"Obviously we will not take this sitting down. She will arrive here tomorrow from Bohol. So she went directly to her boss because her boss is a woman so she directly went to her to feel safe knowing that a woman can relate but pinagalitan siya ng senior niya kasi bakit daw dumiretso agad sa boss.That's what made her mad kasi katatapos lang ng nangyari tapos ganun ang approach sakanya.

So ang scenario is they were in a bar with other coworkers, then hinawakan siya sa pwet ng buong kamay. 60+ yrs old na ang nanghipo and none of the other coworkers saw it because pa-simple daw ginawa. May nagsabi nga daw na coworker na ""natapik lang daw yung pwet siguro"". But there were prior incidents that occured that she didn't reported like yung hinahawakan siya sa hita and yung mga dirty jokes sakanya. And she also said na pag dating daw nila sa bohol, pinipilit daw siya nung nanghipo na magkatabi daw sila sa van. The incident happened 2 days ago. I have the convo she had with the senior but hindi ko alam bakit ayaw ma upload sa reddit. She filed her resignation today and also filed a complaint(blotter) to the police. Is that okay or blotter should be filed during the same day? So nagusap kami kanina through phone, sabi ko ano daw gagawin ng company sa nanghipo? Sabi niya pag sasabihan daw. Tinanong ko siya kung satisfied ba siya doon? Sabi niya hindi. So we decided we will file a case. So I wonder if the company should be liable for inaction because it happened during a company retreat then the suspect is also an employee of the company. She told me that walang HR yung company(idk if this is legal, please let me know it isn't) and wala daw siyang kakampi dun because it's not the ideal working environment. And also walang protocol yung company na ginawa to handle ng incident. They didn't conduct a thorough investigation on the matter and they didnt provide her with any genuine empathy. That's what making us fuming. I wonder if the company is liable for this blatant disrespect for a victim of sexual harassment. It seems they really tolerated a sexual harassment incident. Any informative advice would be helpful guys.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/113qcfw/my_sister_got_sexually_harassed_in_a_company/,t2_sc6nkyum,2023-02-16 21:14:04,55
"Topic: Victim Blaming || ""Wearing provocative clothes increases the risk of being sexually harassed""","Argument 1: Walang pinipiling damit ang mga rapists at mga bastos.

Argument 2: Yes, walang pinipili, pero pag nagsuot ka ng sexy, pinapataas mo ang risk na mabastos ka dahil pinoprovoke mo ang mga lalake. Human instinct ang malibogan at natitrigger yun dahil sa pagdadamit ng revealing.

Okay, I know that the second argument is BS, but this is how victim-blamers think. My question is, pa'no kaya natin mapapaliwanag sa paraan na madali intindihin (without using statistics/data) na hindi dapat mabastos ang kahit na sino dahil lang sa pagsusuot ng revealing clothes.

 Ang argument kasi nila is lagi parin naglilean sa victim blaming. ""Wala na tayo magagawa sa paligid natin ngayon. Kaya dapat mag-ingat nalang. Alangan namang makipagdebate ka sa daan pag may nambastos sa'yo. Edi wag ka nalang magsuot ng sexy."" The people who say this are not exactly bad, concern lang din sila sa safety ng mga babae. Yun nga lang, victim blaming pa rin.

Yung ""rape exists because of rapists"" di nila magets eh. Napupunta pa rin dun sa ""instinct"" daw at mahirap paglabanan yun. So ang solusyon, wag magsuot ng sexy. Pag sinabi naman na ""Eh yung mga hindi naman nakasuot ng sexy nababastos din naman,"" ang sagot naman nila, ""Eh kung yun nga nababastos na eh, edi lalu na pag nagsuot pa ng revealing.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/v8jq8s/topic_victim_blaming_wearing_provocative_clothes/,t2_go09v8uj,2022-06-09 23:45:14,13

Let's talk about sexual harassment in Philippine show-business/film industry.,"This thread is **NOT** a chika minute/blind item thread. Nobody cares about ""slutty daw si so-and-so"" or ""bading daw si so-and-so."" The purpose of this thread is to, at the very least, hear the voices of the victims, and to know who to be wary about.

As great as it was to have the #MeToo movement happen in Hollywood, a lot of us have the sneaking suspicion that things are worse here. Sexual harassment in the local showbiz is the biggest open-secret we have. We've all heard stories about how the industry normalizes sexual harassment¬†and misogyny, and how they try to hide this from the public. But #MeToo (or an equivalent) never got any traction here in the Philippines. At least, not anything close. Why is that? And what can we do to help make it happen?

I myself am a 20-something straight male, and very new to the film industry. The worst that's happened to me is one time this prominent director (I'm not revealing his name because I'm still under his employ) invited me to his office because he's just heard bad news about me personally. He didn't do anything overtly sexual, but he would do things like squeeze my knee with his knees when we were sitting, and hug me for an uncomfortably long amount even when I was trying to break free. He insisted that he was the only person I could trust, not even my parents, and that he'd come to me anytime I'd need him. I know he technically didn't do anything that couldn't be argued as someone being concerned for me, but I could tell he was trying something. Who knows how many other people he's done this to, and how far he's gotten with it.

But as disgusted and dirty as I felt after that, I also know this isn't even close to the levels of trauma a lot of other people have gone through. I think the only way we can help stop this from happening more is by having more discussions about it. We all know it happens, let's hold these people accountable.

**BEFORE SHARING YOUR STORY**: ~~I implore you to use their real names, as this is the¬†only way to truly tell the¬†public about who these people are - but I understand the hesitation to do that. If it's impossible to tell the¬†story without giving away who you are,~~ redact their¬†name so they can't legally claim it's them you're talking about. Make sure to protect your anonymity. Do not use your real name, use a throwaway (anonymous) reddit account, and it's ideal that you leave out enough information so that these stories can't be traced back to your real identity. Otherwise, they could come after you legally, or if you're still under their influence, they may form a vendetta against you.

Edit: Revealing their names is apparently considered doxxing. I'm kind of on the fence about that, since they're the ones doing the crime; but if those are the rules, I can respect it. Let's not doxx anyone. Still, we can have a conversation about sexual harrasment and #MeToo.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/ptjt6e/lets_talk_about_sexual_harassment_in_philippine/,t2_43nezk15,2021-09-23 08:41:04,11

Possible Sexual Harassment case,"PH redditors, 

I am a supervisor and my male DR came up to me with an encounter with another male employee he does not know personally who asked him if he was interested in ""M2M"". this was in the bathroom in our office.

this to me, looks like a possible case of Sexual Harrassment.

Why? if a male asked a female in the office for Sex, wouldn't it be the case?

the same employee has been making ""pssst"", ""his/hellos"" at first and progressed to making ""moan"" sounds (w/c i am a witness of) and my DR did not respond to it at all. Until that bathroom incident when he said he is no longer comfortable with the situation.

We did not engage HR yet bec. we are putting jobs at risk here. However it has gone to a point where it is ""his word against mine.""

How do you suggest we approach this situation. No one else aside from the two (my DR and the accused) were in the bathroom.

Update 1: Email thread has started with management on both sides cc'd. We all agreed to a meeting w/c is yet to be set. Accused side is defensive and denied all accusations, stating we may have questioned his sexuality w/c is considered against company policy.

Update 2: Accused employee is no longer sitting at his usual workstation w/c is near our room. He is now a few seats away enough for us to not see him when we go in and out.

Update 3: HR is now cc'd but has yet to intervene, possibly waiting for the actual meeting to be set.

"My friend was drunk, rode a grab, fell asleep and woke up with her grab driver sexually harassing her. Has anyone gone through sexual harassment before and what did you do?","I posted in this subreddit before because I was mugged, and I know it might seem sketchy that I'm posting again regarding a disastrous event but my friend messaged me this morning at around 6am. She told me she was harassed. She was shit ass drunk last night, her friend booked her a grab and she woke up 3 blocks away from her house inside a Grabcar with her Grab driver on top of her, kissing her and unbuttoning her pants. 

She froze, she didn't know how or what to react. She didn't fight back as she was scared he might do something else. Apparently, there was no penetration but he performed oral sex. After, she said ""Kuya, baba na po ako."" and he let her out.

She's traumatized, doesn't know what she should do first, should she report it to the police even though she has no proof? She's worried that people might think she's a slut for consenting it and not stopping it, but I understand her reaction, she froze and was surprised. She's also worried because she was drunk and people might think she brought it upon herself, for her to be harassed because she was unconscious.

Has anyone experienced this? What did you do? Need advice.

Be the judge: Sexual harassment account of a student riding a bus. Believable or not? (NSFW),"From the FB account of Kaye Domingo:

MY SUPER DUPER """"""SAFE"""""" EXPERIENCE FROM RIDING THE BUS THIS MORNING (Igan bus en route to Vito Cruz).

I'm really having doubts about posting this because I'm still in shock and di ko sure kung may mapapala ako dito but I need to post this so I can reach out to my friends, family, and to every woman out there especially those who are commuting to school or work daily.

*Nahihiya ako i-explain in details pero gusto ko i-emphasize kung gano siya kababoy.*

Okay so I rode the bus around 5:25 am at Times (Las Pi√±as) because I was on my way to school for an 8 am class. Nakatulog ako along the way. Nagising ako sa may Zapote kasi may tumabi saking lalaki (around his late 40's na ata or maybe 50+ na siya?) and biglaan yung pagkaupo niya. Two-seater. Ako yung nasa kanan sa bintana tapos siya sa aisle. His arms were crossed tapos nakaprotrude yung left hand niya so medyo naaabot chest ko (naka cross kasi arms kaya left hand niya yung nasakin). At first, I didn't mind it kasi hindi naman mabigat braso niya. Di pinepwersahan. Tapos yung kamay niya, hindi naman ako hinahawakan talaga. So I went back to sleep.

Bandang toll gate, medyo iba na yung feeling. Gising na ko pero I was pretending to still be asleep kasi pinapakiramdaman ko siya. Yung finger tips niya na sa may nipple area ko na (shet sorry nahihiya talaga ako magsabi ng ganitong terms). Akala ko natatamaan lang niya pero kinakabahan na ko that time. Sa antok ko, nakatulog lang ulit ako. May times na nagigising ako sa busina ng bus pero di ko binubuksan mga mata ko.

Bandang Coastal, he started rubbing my left boob. Sobrang takot na takot ako hindi ako makaimik, hindi ako makagalaw kahit gustuhin kong lumaban. It's really different when you're in that situation. Natatakot talaga ako kasi di ko din talaga alam gagawin ko. Titigil ba siya? May tutulong ba sakin? Nakakapanghina din talaga.

I was wearing a flannel tapos may sando lang ako sa loob kasi nakabukas yung polo. Tinatry na niyang ihubad yung polo ko. Yung left arm ko inipit niya so hindi ko rin magalaw. He started rubbing the side of my boob pati ilalim hanggang sa hinihimas na niya talaga. Yung braso ko namang iniipit niya, pilit niyang inuusog sa binti niya hanggang sa 'ginising' (kasi gising naman talaga ako) niya ko. Kinilabutan ako sa sinabi niya sakin. He said ""miss itago mo yang cellphone mo baka manakaw yan"" nasa left hand ko kasi hawak hawak ko habang tulog ako. Kahit na alam kong kaya niya pinapatago phone ko is because gusto niyang idikit kamay ko sa binti niya, tinabi ko pa rin. Nilipat ko sa kanang kamay ko yung phone para makuhanan ko manlang siya kasi di ko nga kayang lumaban.

To make things worse, nakaidlip na naman si ate girl niyo sa sobrang antok ko din pero nagigising gising ako. What he did was nilagay niya yung kamay ko sa ari niya tapos inipit lang braso ko. After that, tangina pinasok na niya kamay niya sa loob ng sando at bra ko tapos hinimas na mismong boobs ko. Sobrang nanginginig at naiiyak na ko that time pero pinipilit kong maging kalmado.

Dito ako natakot lalo: bandang Libertad, binaba na niya sando ko so nakalabas na boobs ko at pinipisil niya lang. Every time na may bababa o sasakay ng bus tinatakpan lang niya ng polo ko para di siya mahuli.

What's next?? SA BABA NAMAN AKO HINAWAKAN. Sa crotch ko. Kahit sa labas ng pants, he started rubbing me down there. Tapos balik na naman sa boobs ko. Then he started rubbing my hand on his crotch.

Pagdating sa may CCP, ang daming nagsi-tayuan at bumaba ng bus so inalis muna niya kapit niya sakin. I took it as an opportunity to ""wake up"" and fix my things tapos di na ko pumikit ulit. Inayos ko na lang damit ko at sarili ko kahit sobrang nanghihina na ko. Then tinanong niya ko, ""san ka ba bababa miss?"" tapos tinignan niya katawan ko. Di ko siya masagot, nakatingin lang ako sakanya naiiyak di ko alam pano magreact so I ignored him. Lumipat siya ng seat (as seen sa video skip niyo na lang sa 00:25) una sa kabilang side then sa likod ko.

Pagdating sa Vito Cruz (sa may ministop) tumayo na ko para bumaba ng bus. Tumayo rin siya kaagad at sumunod sakin and he pulled his phone out, dinikit niya sa tenga niya kunwari may kausap tas nagmamadali kuno (this is the 6th time na namanyak ako and they ALWAYS pull this trick para kunwari busy sila or distracted or di naman talaga hinahawakan yang ano mo). I stopped sa aisle bago bumaba. Tumalikod ako to face him tapos dun ko siya nasampal nang malutong tipong nagulat lahat hahaha tapos saka ko lang siya sinigawan nang ""bastos."" He looked SO guilty. Pero sabi niya sakin ""siraulo to ah"" edi pagbaba namin ng bus nakatikim pa siya ng dalawang sampal sakin sabay hampas sa katawan ang laki niya kasing tao hirap patulan. Sabay sigaw din ng ""AKO PA TALAGA YUNG SIRAULO HA???"" hahaha. Sorry medyo dinadaan ko sa tawa I'm still really traumatized at galit na galit pa rin ako pero sige kebs lang.

Di ko maalala kung sa ministop siya pumunta or sa condo sa tabi para iwasan ako. Ako naman, gusto kong ireport kaso wala pa yung mga pulis sa vito cruz. Dumeretso na lang ako sa may corner bago tumawid to wait for my boyfriend to arrive so we could have our breakfast. He tried to calm me down (I'm so thankful for you Geir). Then I went to class na lang and pretended I was fine kahit I was still really in shock.

Words cannot express how truly disgusted I am. Sobrang nakakatakot. Sobrang nakakadiri sa pakiramdam. Nandidiri pa rin ako sa sarili ko kahit ako yung binaboy niya and not the other way around. I wish I could have done more. I wish I could have done something habang ginagawa niya sakin mga kahayupan na yun. But it's really different kapag ikaw na yung nasa ganong situation. Sobrang nakakatakot talaga. Kahit gustuhin mong lumaban ang hirap gawin.

Mas lalo akong natatakot para sa mga kaibigan kong babae especially those who are traveling the same route as mine. He's from Zapote. Bumaba sa Vito Cruz. Sana lagi kayong safe and please keep an eye out for him (kulang pa mga sampal ko sakanya kaya bawian niyo para sakin haha) pati na rin sa ibang mga manyak sa mundo.

Sobrang nakakagalit. I can't believe there are SO MANY men who think they're entitled to our bodies. Manghaharass anytime, anywhere. Shoutout to LTFRB wow napaka safe nga naman talaga gumamit ng bus. And also to our dear president (sorry not sorry) na role model ng mga manyak. Mismong presidente natin - excusing acts like this one. Making it a joke. 

Napakagandang role model. Eto tuloy nangyayari sa aming mga babae. STOP PROMOTING THE IDEA THAT MEN ARE ENTITLED TO OUR BODIES AND ARE ALLOWED TO HARASS AND VIOLATE US.

Online food delivery guy sent lewd texts to my wife,"A delivery guy sent my wife lewd messages after completing a delivery to our house. Sobrang lakas ng loob. My wife filed a complaint via the online delivery app's customer service and she was told that they will do their own investigation. Ang nakakainis lang, they said they won't update her whether or not the driver will be sanctioned regardless of their findings. Sobrang BS. 

I managed to track the prick down and now I know the city where he lives, his previous employers, pati family background niya at madalas na tambayan pag naghihintay ng booking (thanks to my experience being a skiptracer in my father's business). 

I looked the guy up on FB. Nakita ko yung mga comments niya sa ibang post at manyakis talaga si g*go. Comments like ""Balitaan mo kami pag na-tuhog mo na brad."" It's just so fkng triggering, god knows all the unpleasant things I want to do to the idiot. üëøüëø

Sa gigil ko, minessage ko yung asawa niya hoping na sana mag-away sila. Sent her the screenshots of his messages to my wife and told her that we are filing charges. Ngayon she's using the ""poor card"" at parang lalo akong nagalit imbes na maawa. 

This isn't my wife's first rodeo with pervs pero ibang situation ito because the idiot did it right outside our home. Alam ko, medyo slap on the wrist yung penalties sa sexual harassment or unjust vexation at the very least. Data privacy violation? Medyo long shot because we're gonna have to go against the food delivery platform which is a ten tonne gorilla. Pero gusto kong masira buhay niya by suing him to kingdom come at wala na akong paki-alam kung sinog madadamay o maaapektuhan. I have so much hate right now that I've never prayed this hard! I'm frothing in the mouth!üò°üò°üò° Wish us luck. 

P.S. My wife is a lawyer kaya may lakas kami ng loob mag-demanda but otherwise I can only imagine kung gaano kahirap na process ito para sa ibang nabibiktima ng mga t*ngang manyakis.",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ax9v40,t2_svcpbsje8,2024-02-22 23:59:29,4927

1. Disrespect of Time: I really hate this so much. Most Filipinos (based on experience) do not respect other peoples time. You schedule an appointment, most are late, while some will not attend. This is a huge disrespect for peoples who value their time so much.
2. Disrespect of Personal Space: Most Filipinos are not aware trat this thing exists, lalo na sa public places.
3. Disrespect of Trust: Kapag walang nakabantay di gagawin ng maayos ang trabaho, or gagawa ng labag sa batas. Dami kong experience nito sa mga tauhan ko dati sa business.

How does Angkas handle complaints against riders?,"I want to file a report regarding their rider, but I don't want the rider to know it was me. I don't want to be the first person he has on mind when he finds out there's a report against him. He has my number, and he knows my address or at least the building I'm from. 


Onset on the ride he was okay, a bit chatty but okay. He asked questions, nothing sexual or unusual so I answered politely. 

His bike was cramped, thank God I'm fat because my big assed tummy was serving as a barrier. I didn't feel weird cause I've had worse with a habal habal (also felt sexually harassed but that's a different story). Then he would rest his shoulders which would touch my knees and legs, and I didn't really gave meaning to it. 

Until he took my hand and suggested that I hug him. I politely declined and went quiet for a while. Then he asked if he can touch my hand. I told him no again and stayed polite. He asked if I'm afraid of him. I am but I know I shouldn't let him know. 

I just.. couldn't fight or show any signs of discomfort because the worse thing he could do is to take me anywhere but my drop off point. 

I just feel entirely helpless. I also don't wanna deal with making appearances to defend myself, I have no energy for that.

Somebody recorded me while I was in the bathroom stall of UP Town Center.,"This happened yesterday. I'm still affected by it. Wasn't able to do anything today because of depression over this incident. I was at UP Town Center with my girlfriend when I needed to go to the bathroom. For a #2. I noticed a person following me to the bathroom but thought nothing of it.

I was already inside the cubicle when I found out that there was no tissue paper. So I decided to do #1. While doing my business, I noticed that there was a cellphone recording me from the top of the next cubicle. I cursed at whoever was recording me, and that lowlife fled. I chased after him outside the bathroom but unfortunately could not locate him.

Fortunately, the janitor heard the happenings and led us to security so we could report the incident. The perpetrator has now been visually identified. He was zipping his pants up while running away pa puta.

I wish I did more. I wish I looked behind me when I went inside the bathroom to see his face. I wish I tried 100% to run after him. I'm shaken not because of the fact that my junk might be seen, but by the invasion of privacy. Maybe that's why I didn't go out of my room. Sexual harassment knows no gender or sexual orientation. I'm disgusted that such people would do such acts. I hope he gets what he deserves. Rest assured, if I get more information, I'll deal with him with the full force of the law. Apparently, I was the first male to report such happenings in UP Town.

"If you are put in a situation where you will be a dictator of your own Philippines, what are your first few projects/plans?","*A question of the day from one of the Discord servers I am in.*

**Disclaimer: This is just a hypothetical scenario. I am not saying that dictatorship is ok or that it will ever be ok. Resist against dictatorship, tyranny and fascism!**

Anyway.. If I were to become a dictator in my own Philippines, my first few projects/plans would be:

1. Everyone who wishes to get married or build a family and have kids will undergo a complete psychological evaluation. Lahat ng may mga personal issues, malala ang insecurities, may anger management problem, may parental issues, ayusin nyo muna. You will not bring out a kid in my country para lang itraumatize nyo ng mga issues na dapat inaayos nyo muna. Heal up first people.
2. Libreng Health Care at Mental Health Services for everyone. Walang bayad ang hospital at all. Procedures and admission free. Ipapaaircon natin and all hcw will be properly compensated with a competitive salary.
3. Libreng school from nursery to college. All teachers will be properly compensated with a competitive salary.
4. Minimum wage will be 40 to 50k. Tanggalin ang provincial rate para hindi nagsiksiksikan dito sa Manila.
5. WEALTH TAX for all the billionaires and out there. Your businesses are successful because of the manpower and efficiency of my people. Pay up a huge amount of tax from your wealth so my people will enjoy living their efforts. Kung ayaw mo magbayad, leave my Philippines. But I will make sure to tell the world news of how crooked of a person you are. You mess with my people, I will ruin your life.
6. Jail system will be modified. Lahat ng sexual related offense will be segregated. You people are a different breed of monsters. Hindi ko kayo ipapalethal injection but you will be segregated. Magsama sama kayong mga manyak. Ang sentence? Life imprisonment without parole or anything. Literal na mabulok kayo jan.
7. Lahat ng reports ng catcalling and harassment, wala akong pakialam kahit pumayag ang victim na makipagsettle sainyo. Kulong kayo. 6 years!
8. SOGIE, Abortion and divorce will be signed into laws right away. Lahat ng mga bigots jan, you will be punished and dealt with accordingly.

"Afternoon random discussion - Mar 21, 2018","^Prepared&nbsp;for&nbsp;you&nbsp;by&nbsp;[the_yaya](https://github.com/dub4u/the_yaya).

Magandang hapon r/Philippines!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/85z8kv/afternoon_random_discussion_mar_21_2018/,t2_g8u9x,2018-03-21 11:55:04,51
"Yes, no and sex","Early in my feminist ‚Äúpreaching,‚Äù I would often assert that **‚Äúno means no.‚Äù Meaning, once a woman indicates even during the sex act itself that she has changed her mind and no longer wants to engage in coupling, her partner should stop what he is doing.**

Of course, men friends would protest ‚Äî good-naturedly of course or they would no longer be my friends ‚Äî that that was easier said than done. Some insisted that once the implicit contract to engage in consensual sex gets underway, there is no way one party could suddenly abrogate it ‚Äî by pushing the (usually) male partner away and scampering away.

The men would usually speak about it like a major social and personal law had been violated.


A few days ago, an article headed ‚ÄúWhen saying ‚Äòyes‚Äô is easier than saying ‚Äòno,‚Äô‚Äù was published in The New York Times in which the author, Jessica Bennett, talks about a complex situation which ‚Äúmost women instinctively understand.‚Äù And that is: ‚ÄúThe situation you thought you wanted, or maybe you actually never wanted, but somehow here you are and it‚Äôs happening and you desperately want out, but you know that at this point exiting the situation would be more difficult than simply lying there and waiting for it to be over. In other words: saying yes when we really mean no.‚Äù

It seems that terms to describe this iffy situation exist: ‚Äúthe point of no return,‚Äù ‚Äúgray zone sex,‚Äù ‚Äúbegrudgingly consensual sex,‚Äù ‚Äúlukewarm sex,‚Äù and ‚Äúof course,‚Äù writes Bennett, ‚Äúbad sex,‚Äù where ‚Äúbad‚Äù refers ‚Äúnot to the perceived pleasure of it, but to the way you feel in the aftermath.‚Äù

The conversation around what constitutes consent, no matter how reluctantly and grudgingly given, comes at a particularly sensitive time (at least in the United States) when one man after another, one celebrity after another, has lost his job, his reputation, and it seems his future prospects due to charges of sexual harassment, exploitation, even rape. What‚Äôs been missing in the conversation, says Bennett, who is the NYT‚Äôs gender editor, is that ‚Äúconsent isn‚Äôt always black and white.‚Äù

‚ÄúSometimes ‚Äòyes‚Äô means ‚Äòno,‚Äô simply because it is easier to go through with it than explain our way out of the situation,‚Äù writes Bennett. ‚ÄúSometimes ‚Äòno‚Äô means ‚Äòyes,‚Äô because you actually do want to do it, but you know you‚Äôre not supposed to lest you be labeled a slut. And if you‚Äôre a man, that ‚Äòno‚Äô often means ‚Äòjust try harder‚Äô‚Äîbecause, you know, persuasion is part of the game.‚Äù

Bennett quotes sociologist Harry Brod who says that ‚Äúa lot of what we as young men learn as seduction is really more like preparatory sexual assault training.‚Äù Or, as a male friend of Bennett‚Äôs asserted: ‚ÄúIn a man‚Äôs mind ‚Äòno‚Äô is always negotiable.‚Äù

These days, says Bennett, the ‚Äúconsent standard‚Äù for consensual sex relies on the woman actually, vocally saying ‚Äúyes.‚Äù This is because ‚Äúbody language‚Äù in sexual scenarios can at times be unreliable‚Äîprone to being misread, misinterpreted, or overinterpreted. Men and women, writes Bennett, ‚Äúhave widely different understandings of consent.‚Äù She notes that in a study, 61 percent of men said they rely on nonverbal cues to indicate whether a partner consents, while only 10 percent of women said they actually give consent via body language.

But the problem of misinterpretation or miscommunication has deeper roots than mere cluelessness. ‚ÄúThe reality is that no matter how many sexual harassment training programs we enroll in, or how much activists extol the virtues of consent, we are missing something deeper: Our idea of what we want‚Äîof our own desire‚Äîis linked to what we think we‚Äôre supposed to want, with what society tells us we should want. And most of society tells us‚Äîwhen it comes to women and sex, anyway‚Äîis wrapped in dangerously outdated gender norms.‚Äù

**When I was in high school, classmates and older female relatives talked about the problem of confronting a young man who would ask you for a dance when all you want to do is to gossip among your female friends. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt hurt his feelings,‚Äù we were told, ‚Äújust dance with him and it‚Äôll be over soon.‚Äù That was about dancing, but it might as well have been about sex.**

Just a few thoughts on the jakolandia subreddit and other things remotely similar:,"Regardless if r/jakolandia has been successfully reported and taken down, or not, we shouldn't really be celebrating. For as long as these people continue to roam free, are not held accountable, and do not get proper sanction for engaging in the said behavior, this kind of toxic culture will continue to thrive. It's not going to stop just because we've reported it. Remember the pastor FB groups? The countless leaked ""men's locker room talk"" group chats? The holy grail GDrives? Sure, it's all been aired online for everyone to frown upon and loathe, but there aren't many cases (is there even one?) pushed forward in order to put these people behind bars. These incidents already border on child pornography and sexual harassment (yes, inappropriate and unsolicited sexual remarks count), which should be punishable on legal grounds. The people who are involved in this will never understand the gravity of what they're doing hangga't walang isa sa kanila ang nasa-sanction. They will just move on to other platforms and maybe figure out other safer and more discreet means to engage in the same disgusting behavior.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/agj2q9/just_a_few_thoughts_on_the_jakolandia_subreddit/,t2_26azbb8y,2019-01-16 16:17:46,23

Beauty Pageants are degrading.,"I might gather downvotes for this pero ok lang. Lol

Here are the reasons:
1. Promote natural beauty butall the candidates wear make up, and most of their sponsors are beauty products;
2. Candidates should've self-esteem and confidence but these tend to be jolted dahil sa judgment mga judges based on different things;
3. Huge amout of money was spent just to promote a cause but it could've been better if the money utilized for the pageant was directly used for the cause;
4. Highly susceptible to sexual abuse/harassment between the candidates and the organizers/judges.

Arriving in NAIA,"My family migrated to Australia in 1996 I love coming back home to the Philippines we usually do every 2 years but because of Covid it‚Äôs been 4 years since my last visit

A lot has changed since my last visit I‚Äôve met someone and had a baby, so was super excited to come back and bring my daughter to her home country and introduce her to my/her culture meet some of her family and to go finally try Jollibee :) ( my partner is half Filipino she‚Äôs been coming her since she was little too )

But last night we had the worst experience arriving in NAIA from Singapore unfortunately I had to get a different flight as I had to get PCR test at Changi so I can be cleared for immigration in NAIA, we found a PAL flight that arrived at the same time but my flight arrives at terminal 1 and they arrive at terminal 2. I thought that was ok I‚Äôll make them wait and scoop them up after I‚Äôm cleared and collect my luggage.

When my daughter and partner arrive after their flight the constant harassment and touting from random airport workers were disgusting to the point where they were followed all the way from the arrival gate to the bay where they waited for me.

They were even followed to the comfort rooms and they waited at the ladies front door waiting for them, constantly asking her if they need help after being told numerous times they were fine, the worst part was she can understand a bit of Filipino and what they were saying about her was absolutely disgusting Filipino sexually harassment at its finest.

Based on the people who previously worked there (they‚Äôre my friends and info is first hand) they said that this firm has a very toxic environment‚Äî the way they treat women and female employees/staff, manyak, condones cheating etc. Glad I was able to ask around and learning from that, I want to do a bit of research first before accepting any job offers  (not that I have many lol).

When your peers or you yourself set up a deadline, realistic or not, they expect you to abide by it and deliver - and to be transparent on the issues that you encountered causing delays and issues, and not make petty excuses or push the blame on others that just show your incompetence.

His crass behavior towards women would've incurred a number of sexual harassment reports with HR. The number of expletives that run off his tongue, the number of threats he has made against not just his critics but also to the Filipino people, the blatant lying, the inexcusable tardiness, the lack of accountability - everything about this man screams unprofessional and incompetent.

Everything about him as a president is the complete opposite of what a president should be, yet there are still people who praise him and find entertainment in what he does for whatever reason they have. Is this really the kind of person you want governing the country or is this the same standard you wish to be subjected to?
