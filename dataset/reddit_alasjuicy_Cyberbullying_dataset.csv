My GUTS saved me from HIV but not the cyberbullying,"Just want someone to help with my trauma. I escaped the hiv pos guy in or*y but I didn't escape the paninira at pananakot from the older stupid guy after confronting him. I said he should've been more careful next time and he got angry with me, I just confronted both of them and they were never sorry and threatened me instead.  I got my worries from kissing the hiv pos guy, I only knew his status from my other buddy na pinakita sa akin yung chats sa messenger. Then the older guy ay sinaraan ako sa gc ng prep users DAW at taking revenge on me.

But months and years later nakahinga rin ako kasi hindi ko nacontract yung virus from that guy dahil kiss lang interaction namin, my guts saved me not to interact with him. But the trauma and fear from the older guy is still there and he keeps on creating new accounts kahit blinock ko na siya.

(After looking at his fb, I found out na pumayat siya nang todo. I just think na advanced karma niya yun sa pangttake advantage niya sa akin esp sa age gap namin. I was student at a time we met and I only met him because he invited the guy I liked. I didn't like him cos he's like a manong with big arms, I already blocked him last time but he persisted na makausap ako and gaslighting me kasi 'he is considering me as a friend' when I don't consider him and just being nice to him.)
