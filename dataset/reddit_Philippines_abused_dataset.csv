Beware of customer data being abused from FoodPanda drivers.,"Since FoodPanda drivers have access to your number to call or text you when they arrive, beware that they can actually take advantage of that and stalk you on social media. The screenshot was taken from Telegram, where I strictly only use for my review center’s gc. I replied because I thought it was one of the staff from my review center because they are the only ones who knows of my account in Telegram. Low and behold this bizarre text I received from a rider that delivered my food earlier that afternoon. 

FoodPanda should really look into this and find a solution to avoid this from happening, this is SCARY. Not only do they know now where you live, your number, but as well as your name too. My suggestion is that they should keep the interaction between customers and riders within the app to avoid them gaining access to your data and using it to stalk you.

for more context: I continued to explain that he had the wrong number and replied that it wasn’t because he was the rider that delivered my food earlier. He proceeded to ask if we can chat and whether or not I have a husband or a boyfriend already. I blocked him after that.",https://i.redd.it/hkrqig24fxlb1.jpg,t2_h5x4shhsh,2023-09-03 07:25:22,1118,155

Please help me. Sobrang desperado ko na to know kung anong lagay ng abused OFW mom ko sa Saudi.,"Please help me.

Baka merong OFW dito na based sa Saudi. Makikisuyo sana ako. I am so desperate to know kung anong lagay ng mom ko. She's a DH sa Dammam, Saudi Arabia. According sa kwento ng kasama ni Mama sa bahay, pinadampot siya sa pulis ng amo nila after siya bugbugin. Wala pa akong tulog eversince trying and calling kung sinu-sino. Kaya nagbabakasakali na rin ako dito. Baka may Saudi-based OFW din dito na pwede magcheck sa nearest precinct or hospital sa area ng mom ko. I'll pay for the transpo and hassle, kahit ano. Please. 

Prior to this incident, nirerefuse na nilang bilhan ng ticket si Mama para makauwi no'ng nagpaalam siyang gusto niya na umuwi ng Philippines. After ng nangyari, walang pinapayagan na lumapit sa kanya kaya walang may clear view of what happened. Tapos after almost an hour, may dumating na mga pulis to get her. I just want to know kung okay siya and I can go on from there. According din kasi sa kwento, binagok siya sa wall ng cr at pinagsusuntok. Please help me. I am losing my mind na thinking how is she. Thank you na agad sa magrerespond.


Edit: Yes, lumapit na ako sa agency niya, OWWA and still trying to reach Embassy. Wala pa ring balita from them that's why I am trying all ways possible. 

Update: I have a conversation with someone from OWWA pero until now in progress pa rin yung case report and wala pa akong hawak na case number na pupwede ifollow up. Sa Embassy naman sa Riyadh, buong morning ako nagtatry magcall but there's one answering, will continue to try. Thank you for your prayers. 


*Update: Nagcontact na po yung Mama ko. She called me just now. Pumutok yung labi niya at panay siya pasa at sugat. Nasa police station daw siya ngayon. Kinulong nga siya at nagspend ng night sa selda, tinrasfer sila to another police station kaya nagkachance silang mahawakan yung mga gamit nila. Tinake niya agad yung brief moment to call na she's alive and safe. Nacut din yung call agad. Thank you sa mga nageexpress ng concerns and help. Thank you talaga


**Update: It has come to our knowledge rin na yung local agency dito sa PH ng mom ko ay sarado na years ago pa. I have tried to go sa PAO for legal advice and what and what not to do kasi parang pinagpapasahan lang ako sa ibang offices. I should update the case report sa OWWA into a potential human trafficking case na sabi ni Atty. Kasi if years ago pa closed na and 'di alam ng mom ko while they kept my mom there, eh iba na raw yun. I should request for immediate rescue na raw, hindi na assistance. Idk if there's anything about this case ba na hindi nagsscream ng IMMEDIATE ACTION. And I still don't know kung mamamadali ba to this way kasi wala pa ring update from them. I will try to update as best as I can.

Need help!! saan pwede magsumbong anonymously about PNP Officials abuse of power,"Someone close to me was taken and detained illegally by the PNP Officials. They accused him of being involved in illegal drugs pero nung walang ebidensyang nakuha sa kanya, illegal gambling nalang. Dinakip sya at 2 PM, at dinala sila somewhere na parang bodega and by 6 pm, nung medyo madilim na, dinala na naman sila to some place na may nakahanda ng mga playing cards at gambling money. They were told to act like they were playing/gambling. He reasoned na di niya alam yung laro, they told him to shut up while they took photos of them. The police brought them to jail and file a complaint against them for illegal gambling. They took 500 php from his wallet (they took all his things) and detained him for 12 hrs. After 12 hrs, when they decided to release him, they told him to wait for his warrant (agad agad??) and to be back with the money for penalty fine. 

Mahirap lamang sila and can’t afford a private lawyer. When they went to their local pnp station (other city sya nadakip) they advised him to just plead guilty para iwas gulo. Why?? Eh wala ngang kasalanan yung tao eh. I have witnessed the trauma they have caused to the person, ilang araw ding umiiyak at walang tulog because of what happened and thinking na may kaso na sya. He cant even drive his motorcycle going to work dahil natrauma. We can’t ask any pnp officers for help here in the province kasi nagtutulungan lang nman silang lahat. Please we need your help.

"Domestic Abuse against men seen as ""Lambing""","I was walking to the public market to buy calamansi for bicol express during lunchtime. The market is elevated with stairs leading down to the parking area where trucks unload their products, pedicab and tricycles also use the area as their terminal. I overheard two pedicab drivers conversing by the stairs and stopped when one of them mentioned going to the barangay to report something.

There were two men, one was no taller than 5ft and the other one around 5'4"" (as tall as my mom). Their conversation was in bicol but it went like this:

2nd guy: Pare! Bakit mapula at namamaga ang noo mo?

1st guy: Sinuntok ako ni misis kagabi, nakalimutan ko kasi yung pinapabili niya.

2nd guy: >!Buli ni ina niya yan!< Bakit di ka umiwas o lumaban?

1st guy: Alam mo naman na mas malaki sakin si misis at nakikitira lang kami sa magulang niya.

2nd guy: Di ka dapat nagpapatalo pare, ipinablotter mo sana sa barangay!

Give An Abused Cat A New Life This Easter,"GIVE AN ABUSED STRAY CAT A NEW LIFE THIS EASTER (FB: Moggie Cat PH)

Help me save this abused cat so that he may be given a chance for a better life.  

Drew suffers from Diaphragmatic Hernia and awaiting a very high risk operation tomorrow. Apparently, somebody kicked or pinalo ng malakas ang cat. This has torn his diaphragm so the content of his stomach went all the way up to his chest, lungs and heart which makes breathing difficult.  

I already paid 2K for his xray and put down a 4K deposit at Manila Feline Center using my personal funds. However, there is still 7K left to pay for his surgery, additional confinement days (2.5K per day) and other tests that Drew may need including post-surgery management. 

Drew has already suffered a series of abuse: abandoned by his owner, blunt force trauma caused by an animal abuser and is now facing a high risk surgery, which he may not survive.

I only wish for Drew to survive and his best bet is the surgery. No amount is ever small for a little soul that is fighting for his life.

two men abused me,"Trigger warning: sex, abuse, pedophilia. 

Pedophilia and sexual abuse are rampant in the Philippines, it is a disgusting and inhumane act that is preserved by people in the deep dark corners of our country. However, what's more, depressing is the fact that male victims are often overlooked by the law of our society. I am going to share my story as someone who experienced a travesty that until today affects me. This is my first time sharing this. 

Hello, I am currently a 24-year-old male, and I never really talked to anyone about what I experienced. 

It happened in 2006 in San Juan City, in a gated compound. Inside that compound, there was a massage (hilot) service, and my grandparents frequently went there after a hard day of driving since it was cheap. I met my assailants when my grandmother brought me along to the compound when she was going to get a massage so that I could accompany her. While she was getting her massage, I was wandering around the compound

Two people took notice and approached me and I still, for the life of me, can't remember their names, so I am gonna call them Glasses and Skinny based on how I remember what they look like -- one was tall (5'6) and wearing glasses, white skin, straight hair, medium size build with clean-cut. The other guy was shorter (5'4), thin with, brownish skin, and also has short and straight hair. They asked my name and what was I doing inside the compound, then after telling them, Glasses invited me to his apartment so that I could wait there comfortably, and because I was a gullible and ignorant child I accepted their invite. 

I saw their Play Station and their SEGA Dream Cast and they were kind enough to let me play their consoles, they also gave me food and drinks while I was waiting for my grandmother. Well, as a poor boy it was a dream come true to play consoles. I went to check the screen door to see if my grandmother was done with her massage, and she was, so I left their house, and went home. 

The next day, I went back to the compound because I was excited to play their consoles again, and they did, they were good people or so I thought and, this continued for two days. It was April 22, 200,6 when it happened, I went back to my supposed friends in the compound and while we were playing, they asked me to go upstairs because they want me to show a ""magic trick"", and I did. We were inside a bedroom, then both of them approached the bed and I clearly remember what they told me ""ang galing nito, tignan mo"". (This is amazing, look at this)

Skinny layed down on the bed while Glasses was on his knees above him. Glasses then proceeded to remove the shorts of Skinny. I saw his penis, and I felt nervous and confused, then Glasses started to put Skinny's penis inside his mouth, then out, and inside again, then they switched positions. After they were done, they told me 

""Diba ang galing? Ikaw naman ah"" (Isn't it amazing, now you try it) 

I told them, ""Ayoko po, gusto ko na umuwi"" (I don't want to, I want to go home)

I wasn't able to move an inch, I was nervous and scared of what I witnessed. Skinny lifted me and placed me on the bed, Glasses took my shorts off and he did what he did, while Skinny was moving my hand to stroke his penis. Luckily enough, penetration didn't occur. I went silent after what happened to me, ever since then I have had e a certain fear and level of discomfort towards sexual encounters or sex itself. I feel uncomfortable about the topic or the concept itself. 

For sixteen years I've kept this all to myself because I never really understood what happened since I was only eight at the time that it happened.

Abusing FPJ's legacy for corruption,"Di ko alam if dito ba or sa r/offmychestPH dapat eto pero I am working with LRT1 and I wish to be anonymous. Share this sa lahat ng social media ninyo para kumalat at malaman ng taumbayan ang totoo.

So eto na nga, diba may palabas ang LRT1 kanina na half day daw sila kasi may need sila ayusin sa mga tren nila? Apparently palabas lang ang lahat dahil request ito ng pulitikong ampon ni FPJ dahil ayaw niya na matao, madaming magpapapicture, at may operation ng tren habang ininaugurate niya ang pagpapalit ng pangalan ng station na siya mismo ang nagtulak. Nilakad niya ito kasama nung kaibigan niyang brodkaster turned pulitiko na walang alam at isinuka noon ng Duterte administration dahil walang alam pero nakabalik dahil kapit tuko at iniwan ang presidentiable niya on the last minute noong eleksyon.

Ang siste pa lalo ay binraso nila ang board ng LRT na maglabas ng board resolution ukol dito para mangyari ito dahil sa budget naman ng DOTr ibabawas eto and the kickbacks na makukuha mula dito. Binawasan ang budget ng ibang programa ng ahensya para sa milyong kontrata para ibayad sa pagpapalit pangalan kaya may mga logo ng DOTr at LRT. Wala sa batas na kelangan palitan ang pangalan ng train stations dahil DPWH lang ang inaatasan magpalit ng pangalan at applicable lang ito sa mga kalsada.

Eto ang legacy ng nakaraang lider ng DOTr, palitan ang pangalan ng istasyon kasi milyones na raket ito.

Alleged abused Filipina undocumented worker charged with illegal residence in Switzerland,"I just saw this in a news article in French and found an English version. 

Sadly, this Filipina in Geneva, who complained about her situation (being threatened and beaten), was instead investigated for illegal residence and might be deported. The UN has, at least, intervened during the trial. 

I understand why Philippine immigration is so strict when Filipinos travel abroad for vacation, but they still cannot catch illegal human traffickers, while inconveniencing so many others. With the amount of rules they come up with everyday, you'd think they know what they're doing. 

But when life in the Philippines is hell, you can't blame Filipinos for finding a way, no matter how dangerous, to get out of the country and find greener pastures.

The abuse is very apparent everyday, and I swore to the day I turned 18, I will move out. My mother has taken my legal documents, (which I have on me again temporarily, I used university applications as an excuse for her to give it to me.) My bank account is legally still bounded to my mother so any transactions I make, she can see. If I try to do anything with it, she will beat the life out of me.

My sister doesn't help. She would do everything to snitch on any attempt she catches me that is against my parents' house rules. I don't even see her as my own sister anymore.

I've considered moving out of the country just to cut all contacts with them.

I don't have any jobs that pays, but I want to so I could be able to financially help myself. I want to move out to a safer place. Someone, please, help me. I don't have anyone to turn to.

With my utmost sincerity, and wholeheartedly, want to let you know that I appreciate each, and every single one of you. I have teared up and even sobbed because I'm quite a stranger to this act of kindness as I was deprived of this growing up. 

I used to think that living life was impossible for someone like me, pero naiintindihan ko rin na it will get better as long as I try to keep fighting and finding better ways to cope. It's really hard to live in the same house of your abusers, hence why I am trying to leave. I will take all of your advice that are logical, safe, and ensured to put me in a better place.

I love you all. Thank you.

I'll update in the near future, or a year or two from now.  


This is me, signing off.

Why do Filipinos bully or abuse me?,"I'm half Japanese and Filipino, grew up in Japan most of my life. I can speak Japanese, Tagalog and English just fine so language barrier isn't really a problem. Just letting you know that I am not here to hate.

I've been bullied by Filipinos most of my life especially by Filipinos who are in Japan. I've been abused by my Filipino mother since I was a child so I developed some mental issues like depression and anxiety and everyday I fight off the voices inside my head that tells me to just kill myself. But yea, when I went to school in the Philippines, people spread rumors about me like I had sex in school when in fact I was still a virgin at the time. When I speak my mind they just wanna be aggressive like I was trying to offend them... I just don't understand. When I started working in Japan, they would put loads of work on me or yell at me for being slow and I often hear them talking behind my back. One offered help when I was having troubles in my life... She said I could stay at her place for a while. After that she accused me of stealing her phone and kicked me out without even letting me get my stuff. I loved my Filipino grandmother because she was the kindest person I have ever met so I am not being racist here. Now, I'm currently in the Philippines under a tourist visa... Here for a year so far and now, they try to take me for a fool for money. Like trying to make me pay double for bills, make me pay a bill that wasn't even mine before I move in etc. I want to understand why they do it to me? Do they do it because I'm half Japanese? Back home Japanese just take me as Japanese and accepts me for who I am... I just want the half part of me to do the same. When I'm so quiet coz of anxiety and depression, they take it the wrong way and pull me down even more... Like why? :( I want to embrace my Filipino side but how can I if they take me for granted? I'm not saying all... I'm just really unfortunate to experience it. I know there are nice Filipinos out there and I just haven't met them yet...

Edit: Thank you everyone for your nice and helpful comments. I wasn't expecting that people would actually take my post with an open mind, I was expecting something negative. I was trying to see some positive side of Filipinos... For what I've experienced are so unpleasant. But you guys have shown me that there is a good side. I'm glad I posted here ~ 

Another edit: It didn't happen in one area. Most part of the bullying happened in Japan. For a bit more than 10 years it just kept happening to me until it came to the point where I detached myself from any Filipinos for quite a bit back in Japan. But by blood, I am still half Filipino so I couldn't, and shouldn't reject the Filipino side of me for it is part of my identity if that makes sense. I came here to take a breather from all the bad memories and had this thought of maybe Filipinos in the Philippines are nicer than the ones in Japan. From the bullying, I lost all my self esteem, fed my negative thoughts more and made me withdraw from society. Yes, I became a hikikomori. Some of you might not see it as bullying or insulting but all those events have impacted me mentally. I developed self harm from it. Where I would hit my head to a hard surface over and over, cut my wrist arms and legs, overdose and hanging which failed because it snapped but it only left a bruise around my neck.

Too ashamed to admit that I'm being abused as a guy and too scared to do anything about it.,"Hi everyone. Just a disclaimer, I'm not posting this to gain some pity. I simply want to lay out my story before I break down. It's your prerogative to judge whether you will believe if any of this is true.

My story started about more than a year ago. I was an OFW and flew back to the Philippines for a quick Christmas and  New Year's break (2019 - before covid). It was a surprise visit for my parents which I haven't seen in almost 2 years. Please take note that I've never been back to the Philippines for more than 10 years. I usually go on a trip with my folks every 2-3 years outside the Phils.

Being it as a surprise, I didn't went back to my hometown for a few days as I wanted to surprise them on Christmas eve. I booked a hotel in Manila near the casino and MOA for a few days. 

Knowing that I'll probably spend some days by myself, boredom got to me and I tried out Tinder - just for fun (I was single then, fyi). Got a few good matches - weeding out some catfish, fakes, and ""service providers"" -  and tried out meeting  with some of them.

Then, I got matched with this one girl. We decided to meet just for a drink. When we met, she brought her own car to drive us around. Since I'm not really familiar about the watering holes in Manila, I let her decide where to go. I told her to ""surprise"" me. We actually had a great night. We bonded, laughed, got a few drinks, and ended up back to my hotel. Needless to say, I had a great time and for someone who I just met on a dating to turn out to be such a catch - and so I thought.

We kept in touch after that. Went out for dinner a couple of times after that and everything was great. Got to know her a bit more. She's a recruitment manager at one of the top call centres here in the Philippines. That info alone got me really excited. She has already achieved so much, independent, and acted very sophisticated around that time. I thought, on a very rare case, that I found the one by sheer luck - on a dating app of all places. Call me naive now. I'm thinking the same, too.

Christmas eve came. The time had come for me to check out and surprise my family. We both decided to meet again after NYE. I was over the moon during the holidays. After spending NYE in Boracay with my folks, I checked in to a hotel in Manila a few days before my flight. We met a couple of times during that time. I'm aware that LDR does not work - at all. Still, on my last night, we decided to give it a go.

Back abroad (I will not provide the actual country. Since she or her family might recognize that this is me), we kept in touch and everything was going well. I actually planned to surprise her by going back to the Philippines after a few months. Really looked forward to it. Then, covid happened. So, plans changed and I have to wait for a flight to be available back to the Phils. As I waited, I kept hope alive. I already have an apartment in Eastwood waiting for us. I've been working at home pre-covid and doing well for myself so I thought giving us a chance back in the Phils should be just fine. Besides, of she's actually the one then the gamble will pay off. I was ecstatic.

July 2020. Finally got a flight back home. Can't even sleep on my way back. Got quarantined for a few days. Once that's all done, I was counting the minutes while in a cab to meet her again. Our reunion was great and exceeded all of my expectations. We spent being on lockdown in our new place. Everything was perfect. When they eased the lockdown, I met some of her relatives. I immediately felt that I belonged. We shared drinks, got invited to their family gatherings, and even hosted their Christmas party last year. I really thought back then that everything was going as great as they can be. I wish I could've known what will happen next.

A few months after that, we found a better place in our neighborhood. It was amazing. We immediately got it and moved in. So, the usual routine. Weekdays, we work at home and got our dinner outside. Weekends, we meet her parents or some of their relatives for a casual drink. Everything went like this until a few days ago..

Don't get me wrong, we've been in a few fights during this. Nothing really serious but I should've seen some signs and ran away as fast as I can. There was an instance where the fight got really bad and she threatened me that she'll hurt herself if I will not stay. I tried stopping her and got my finger clipped by a kitchen scissor in the process. She was in shock (due to the blood all over our floor) and got back to her senses immediately. She apologized and I thought it was just ok as long as she understands that this type of accident wouldn't happen if she'll act more rationally.

I initially thought that her emotional blackmails would stop. They didn't. Only got worse. I tried calming her every single time. The end of our fights is usually the same: We fight, she'll blackmail me, hurt me physically in the process, then we'd make up. I know, I'm an idiot.

This went on. Then just a few days ago, the worst thing happened. We were in her parents house to grab a couple of drinks and chat. They have some guests which I've already met a couple of times before. Out of nowhere, she went to a corner. I asked everyone where she was and I approached her. Asked her what was the problem then she suddenly started a fight. Asking me why I haven't introduced her to my parents yet. So, I answered that we're still new and I want to make sure that we're both sure before that happens. I cared so much about my mum and would like to introduce her only if we're sure where we are going with this. She immediately yelled: ""Well, fuck your mum!"". I whispered and gave her a chance to revert whatever she just said. She might have seen how furious I was and then she yelled: ""Dad, he's gonna hurt me!"". I was stunned. It felt like being wrongly accused of rape. I'm not perfect but I've never hit a girl before. She knew that. How? Because I told her that I'd rather break up with a girl than get violent. I meant that no matter how much they would hit me. I have no qualms with you if you think that this is BS. I'd doubt myself, too. Considering the things I just told you.

Her dad immediately went to us. He asked what's wrong and she said that I was planning to hurt her. Being confused, stunned, and probably in shock - I kept quiet and just lowered my head. Clenching my hands, I was thinking nothing else. I just want to go. I just want to leave her. Then they ganged up on me, her dad, mum, and her. They actually made me feel that I was the bad guy. I can't even remember what they were telling me. I thought I got deaf for a while. All I can hear is white noise and my heartbeat. A few minutes after that, she insisted we go home. Her dad said that she should stay. When I heard that, I got a glimpse of hope to escape. I was thinking of packing my stuff immediately once I get back to our place and go somewhere else. Then, she shouted at her dad that she'd rather drive me home and get back. For some reason, they let her. I'm just done by then.

On our drive back, she kept talking to me but I never understood or heard anything. I was in a daze. All I remembered was that we were already in the underground parking lot. I told her that I want to break up - I'm done. I even begged her if we can deal with this as adults. She went ballistic. Not thinking, I ran out of the car. She got back in the car and chased me in the parking lot. I hid behind some of the parked cars. She kept on shouting like an unhinged person.

A few minutes later, the security guy came out of the elevator. Must have seen us in the cameras. As I don't want to create a scandal, I approached him and told him that she was just drunk. He radioed in that the person with her is there. I got confused. Was I the one they were after? A few seconds later, her dad got out of the elevator with another security guy. I just slumped there realizing what the actual fuck happened. They thought I was gonna hurt her. Her dad even came to her rescue and told me not to hurt her. I can only take so much for a night. 

Helpless, I complied to get back to our condo. Her dad left. I never talked. I never moved once we got back. I know that I'm fucked. When they left, she immediately shouted at me. Forcing me to get back with her. Threatening me that she'll kill herself if I don't. A few slaps here and there. More crying. I guess I don't even know what's going on anymore. 

At that point, I knew I was done. I gave up. But I'm not giving myself up to her whims. She told me again to watch her hang herself. I replied: ""I don't care anymore. Go. My life is over anyway. Nobody would believe me."". She pretended to do it but didn't go ahead with it. After I saw that, I told myself that whatever happens next that I wouldn't care anymore.

She's still here at my place. I refuse to talk to her. I can't leave. Even if there's a small indication that I'm about to leave, she panics. Believe it or not, she actually slept in our door last night just to make sure that I can't leave.

I haven't eaten or taken a shower for a few days now. This is my form of protest. Not sure how long I'll last. Don't pity me, I beg you. I took a gamble. I held unto hope that things will get better. I thought that I can be with someone that I will grow to be with. I have no regrets either way

Seeking Legal Advice for Domestic Abuse Situation in the Philippines,"Hi everyone,

In a bit of a situation here. My dad’s been abusive towards my mom, gets worse when he’s drunk.

Heard something about settling things at the barangay, but not sure if that’s enough for such a serious problem.

We’re also thinking about an annulment down the line but are worried about the costs. If anyone knows a good lawyer for these kinds of issues or has any advice on dealing with the barangay or annulment stuff, it would really help.

Food Corporations are so greedy now abusing the current price gouging and just calling it inflation.,"I bought 2 snacks for 5 pesos each. 

Most chips from food corporations increased their price and decreased the content (Regent and Oishi also increased their price but the contents of their products are still decent). Then they will report on huge increase in profits at the expense of their consumers. 

The puto seko I bought from a local bakery change a little in size but not noticeable and the price is still the same. There are some bread that shrunk cause of the high price of flour but they are much more filling to eat compared to the chips with very few content.

Dozens of women and girls, as young as 12, from The Philippines have been tricked and forcibly trafficked to Syria instead of UAE, according to a newly shared report by the Washington Post.

The report also revealed, the women have sought refuge in the Philippines embassy in Damascus; to complain about the abnormal working conditions while working for affluent families, they also asked the embassy to help them return to their homeland.

17 Filipino women and children workers have spoken to the Washington Post revealing grief details about their experiences in Syria as some of the victims were denied payment for the work they were tricked into.

What steps to take to formally file complaint against abusive relatives living in the same house?,"(Long post ahead! But please, take the time to read. I'd like to ask for help.)

Hello. I am an 18 year old college freshman with two younger siblings, 14F and 11M. As the title says, I'm looking for a way to formally file a complaint against our relatives, an aunt and her son (our cousin), which currently live in the same small house as ours.

As you can imagine, madaming tension. It's very rare to find a day of peace, lalo na when the extended family also lives in the same compound and are equally squammy warfreaks. 

My main cause of concern for filing a complaint is that I have no idea how to take the first steps. This is my first year being 18 and I don't even have any useable valid gov IDs as of the moment. I'm also not well-equipped to travel in the case of having to file complaints physically due to financial restraints and my limited knowledge of commuting. I just fear for the worst for me and my siblings.

Some background to all of this: 
Every day we are trapped in this house, we aren't treated like humans. Worst of all, father nalang namin kasama namin sa bahay, and he doesn't know or even dare to defend us, either, in all the years na nagdudusa kami dito. The main argument of all our toxic relatives is ""Edi sana sumama nalang kayo sa nanay niyo."" Like it was that easy, when she's living with the family of her current boyfriend (where the BF knows we exist, but his family does not, let alone know that my mother has an existing marriage she turned her back on). In short, oo, the entire family (father's side) is toxic, the classic filipino family tree that looks more like a cesspool than a ""family"", na may away sa lupa, and anything under the sun.
 
Me and my siblings are also viewed as ""perwisyo"", and worse than just garbage for simply existing, kase pinapahirapan pa daw namin ang lola namin since iniwan kami ng mother namin here when she left. This impression of me and my siblings existed as far back as when I was a toddler, where even as a young child they would call me ""abnormal"", or ""autistic"", ableist, disgusting names that a child should never be called, most especially in the most degrading way possible. We suffer the brunt of this abuse in the hands of our own aunt, cousin, and aforementioned lola. 

To recall some of the things we've endured while growing up (besides the name calling), we've always been verbally and emotionally abused, na kahit bata pa kami nasasabihan na kami na ""Lasunin niyo nalang 'yang mga yan, total perwisyo lang dito sa bahay"". My memory fails to surface the more repressed memories, but name-calling, belittling, and the occassional physical abuse have always been a key part of our childhood here. 

More recently, they have continued this harassment in more ways. Nagkaroon ng isa pang anak ang aunt namin, and he's currently a toddler. He's being taught constantly to call us names (eg. autistic/auti, bobo) instead of using our real names, and has followed in the footsteps of his older brother and mother. There has also been two instances so far where we left our shared bed unattended and it suddenly had been sprinkled with white sugar all over (likely an attempt to have pests and insects bite us). For it to happen twice is no coincidence, but my lola always turns a blind eye to it.

My lola is included in the list of perpetrators because, in simple words, kunsintidor siya. She lets them teach the toddler derogatory words, she doesn't believe us when we say our bed was sprinkled with sugar, and she doesn't bat an eye, or say anything when we are called names, verbally abused or even hit with a snide side comment when we aren't even doing anything except for existing. 

Just tonight, an hour before writing this post, me and my siblings came home to our shoes and slippers missing. We found it some time later, when we saw that they were scattered across our bed. Maybe that was the breaking point, and I had lashed out at my grandmother — to do something, say something, speak to them, before I let myself do something bad to them. She had the audacity to say ""tama na"" and call me a doña for wanting her to stop tolerating and defending her abusive daughter and grandson. I would understand simple favoritism, but to turn a blind eye to all this for so many years, you honestly can't use ""Eh 'yung mga kalokohan mo nga kinukunsinte ko din"", when we don't sprinkle sugar on their beds and purposefully trash our property when it inconveniently gets in their way. 

I have no idea where to begin to start change in this household we have no choice but to survive in, and it's even harder when no one in the family is on our side. Me and my siblings are not perfect and we are not saints, we are young and rebellious to a degree, yes — but that doesn't warrant them treating us like nasty pests all our lives when we didn't ask for it.

I will answer any relevant questions if this post gains traction. I just really need help right now, thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/18uiy8g/what_steps_to_take_to_formally_file_complaint/,t2_2nq2o6p3,2023-12-31 00:09:47,17,19
TW( Sexual Abuse) need legal advise on filling a law suit,"Im 19m

In 4th grade I was raped by my babysitter who is a gay male, this continued for almost the entirety of my 4th grade as he stayed with us. He would make me suck him, rape me, and even do it in my sleep. I didnt object at the time because i though this was normal and didnt make a big deal out of it. I want to file a case but i dont know how as this happened a long time ago and there would be a lack of evidence. The closest piece of evidence i could think of is the OCD that started when he did those to me, which developed into depression and schizoprenia when i was a teenager( seeing sexual hallucinations, gore, etc. testified by my psychiatrist) which took a toll on my life as it affected my studies and mental state.This is really bad cause hes an elementary teacher which could mean he had more possible victims.

So what are your thoughts, do i have a chance at this  and is the evidence valid.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/ud8eyl/tw_sexual_abuse_need_legal_advise_on_filling_a/,t2_mgcst2b9,2022-04-28 01:03:36,276,23

Abuse next door?,"Hi, Philippines. So I moved into a new neighbourhood almost 2 months ago, and ever since I arrived, I've been hearing a young child along my street consistently getting abused by its parent/s nearly every morning and afternoon throughout the week (I can hear it crying from where I stand to work at home and it's been unbearable considering it's been going on since I first heard it, for nearly 8 weeks now – and whenever the crying is coherent, the baby yells ""agay"", which means ouch, and it cries mom or dad, begging for the abuse to stop).

On that matter, there is also a dog suffering the same case on the other side of the street (if you can believe that), and its loud, distressed yelping and alarmed whining has been equally unnerving. I've messaged a local dog rescue on that matter just now (initially conflicted since it appears the abuser is the owner and the case might be simply dismissed as a private matter we have no right to meddle in or something), but I don't know who to turn to on the matter of the domestic abuse.

On both matters, if the reports would require voice recordings for evidence or something, it could be done from my own house, because both are just that loud (signalling the level of abuse these two are enduring, and I estimate the dog to be about 4-5 houses down the street away, and the child about 2-3), and I just can no longer ignore both.

Can anything be done? Would authorities take action if I reported it, or would it be considered meddling with private matters? Please let me know. Please share your experience in resolving such a case if you've had a similar experience. Did they take immediate action, was the matter looked into as soon as you reported it? Thank you!

TL;DR: OP hears ongoing abuse from both sides of the street frequently, a child and a dog, and wants to report both. What is your experience on having resolved such matters if you have already? Thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/kcl7jy/abuse_next_door/,t2_2mrkyviv,2020-12-14 07:16:50,45,27
Office verbal abuse,"Tanong lang ako kung ano ang pwede kong gawin laban sa employer ko na abusive. I've been with the company for more than 4yrs at ilang beses na akong sinigawan, minura, at pinagbantaan na tatanggalin. Foreigner(US) sya pero yung office nya dito sa Pilipinas ay rehistrado. Main office ay sa US.

Hindi lang ako ang ginaganun nya sa company. Halos lahat kami ay ginanun na.

Aalis na sana ako nung Q1 ng taong ito, kaso nagkaroon ng mga quarantine dito at sa iba't ibang bansa kaya sobrang hirap maghanap. Ngayon ay nag-resume na yung ilan sa mga recruiters at naghahanap na talaga ako ng malilipatan.

Bago ako umalis, anong mga pwede kong gawin para makaganti sa kanya(yung legal)? Well, bulsa lang nya pwede kong masaktan. For 4yrs, nagkaroon ako ng fear na kausapin sya dahil sa tuwing tatawag sya sa akin eh panigurado na gan'un ang gagawin nya.

Also, paano ipapaalam sa mga gustong mag-apply dun kung ano ugali nya? Warning na sa iba at para saktan din sya kahit paano. Yung hindi ako madedemanda kapag nalaman nya.

At kung may iba pa kayong ideya kung paano pa ako makakaganti sa kanya lalo, basta hindi ako madedemanda kapag ginawa ko yun. Sobrang tindi lang talaga ng galit ko sa kanya dahil sa abusive behavior nya. Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/k8ybob/office_verbal_abuse/,t2_cs0jd,2020-12-08 13:28:04,1,35
Telcos blocking 3rd Party 4G/5G/LTE Modems and their abuse of SIMREG against consumers [Repost Sanitized],"Dear Redditors,

&#x200B;

Hear my story before you bury this with downvotes. Your Internet freedom is in danger -- and it's your fault

&#x200B;

>This is a re-post with no name-calling and has a reference to hopefully stop the mods from taking an opinion down and now it seems my own story needs a reference before I can share :3  I was not able to edit the original post before the takedown so it's better to repost. Telcos do not like this story exploding :3

I'm using a 5G modem bought from a popular online shopping but found out one day I can't connect online although I have full 5G signal strength and an Unlimited 5G promo subscription.

&#x200B;

**TLDR: Telcos have blocked the entire batch of IMEIs belonging to modems that they are not officially selling. This means if you switch sim it will work fine but once you subscribe to the data promo you won't be able to connect to the internet.**

&#x200B;

This is a predatory practice that aims to punish consumers for not using their official modems which are overpriced and not openline.

&#x200B;

**Let me make it clear: they do not send a notice of the device being blocked, it works on a new SIM until free data is used up, still allows you to subscribe to the promo, and then you know your device is already blocked. Finally, there's no way they will not acknowledge the block (tested with their customer support). They refuse to reimburse the subscription. This is why it's predatory, And yes I have a ticket number from customer support for the issue which most complainants can't get, but I have name-dropped their bosses to give them motivation to go off script.**

&#x200B;

This is where they use an alibi that such modems could be used for scams; which is untrue, it's cheaper to use rooted phones, and apps are easily available for this use,

&#x200B;

Thank goodness that telco corporations' engineers and execs are ""lacking foresight"" people, these 3rd party open-line 5G modems have (obviously) hidden features to change their IMEIs and with the use of IMEI generators online can mask themselves as any other brand.

&#x200B;

This is where SIMREG comes in, it is possible to identify you directly based on the prior record of 3rd party modem's blocked IMEI and mobile number used. Telcos can simply block you again or any other devices you have.

&#x200B;

The worst part is they can simply refuse to acknowledge blocking it (or degrading your data speed). They will tell you that it is your device that has a problem, so don't even try asking x@/smartcares or x@/enjoyglobe on Twitter. They will just simply try to get more personal information from you and build a case against you.

&#x200B;

For tech people like me with 21 years in the IT industry (and half of it working with telcos and knowing all their dirty secrets), this is easy to bypass and shrug off while I keep downloading terabytes of games to play for the holiday via unlimited 5G network without data caps.

&#x200B;

However, it pissed me off when people I know suddenly encounter their modems' data stopped working; who are non-techies, old folks, and students use these devices to save money. Fixing this issue is not trivial or may not even be possible for them.

&#x200B;

Compared to using ISP internet which always breaks (\*\*cough\*\* PLDC) and is vendor-locked. Open-line 3rd part modems can easily switch networks when even one breaks or to avail of cheaper promos. Therefore using these 3rd-party modems is not a privilege, it's a necessity and facilitates the freedom and right of access.

&#x200B;

This is why I'm writing this post to let it be known my opinion is, this is your fault! SIMREG is a tool for corporations' anti-consumer practices, defiles your privacy, and does not stop scams. Your elected lawmakers are way behind in the advancement of IT and you have fallen prey to FUD that made you think everything they are doing is OK.

&#x200B;

Now you are going to start suffering as the corporate overloads take their steps to control your freedom of access.

&#x200B;

Yours trully,

Is it considered animal abuse kung hinahayaan lang yung dog na nakatali sa labas ng bahay umaraw o umulan?,"Hello, I would just like to ask if Is it considered animal abuse kung hinahayaan lang yung dog na nakatali sa labas ng bahay umaraw man o umulan. Husky breed na ginawang bantay literal. And may sakit na din yung dog pero di man lang pinapagamot. Nasa labas lang talaga siya minsan katabi na yung poops niya and maikli lang tali niya nakakaawa pag inaabot niya yung food niya. I'm not sure anong klaseng sakit pero dumudugo yung mata niya last time eh. At nilalangaw na rin.

&#x200B;

Maraming naaawa pero walang gustong mangielam or magsumbong. Minsan hihilingin mo na lang na sana mawala na yung aso para tapos na paghihirap niya. If it is considered as animal abuse, where can it be reported anonymously? And kung may mag rerescue kaya sa dog? Given na meron namang nag mamay-ari pero walang pake kahit pag sabihan mo.

&#x200B;

Isa pang alarming is may bago silang puppy na husky, ayun nakatali lang din sa labas at ampayat na.

Should I report my neighbor for animal abuse (parrots)?,"Hello po

My neighbor used to own 2 African Grey (AG) parrots and originally kept them in a factory/warehouse then moved them into his garage. One of them escaped and flew away a month ago and now only 1 AG remains.

Here's the reasons why I want to report him for animal abuse:

* Bad Living Conditions

The living conditions of the AG are extremely depressing. They have the intelligence of a 7 year old human yet they lack any physical or mental stimulation as there are no toys, only a single perch, almost no sunlight nor any greenery/nature etc.

Their cage is unfit to house parrots as the dimensions are too small, and the spacing between the bars are wide enough to put their heads through, meaning they can break their necks or choke themselves if their heads are outside when startled.

&#x200B;

* Kept inside a garage

Constant exposure to car fumes, toxic Teflon fumes from non-stick pans from the nearby kitchen, and possibility of a gas leak from the LPG tank, both of which are extremely hazardous to parrots due to their vulnerable respiratory system and would cause long term health issues and a painful death respectively.

&#x200B;

* Poor diets

When I talked with the maids, they told me that their diet is mostly seeds and some fruit, and they sometimes don't fill their flimsy plastic bottle cut-out water bowls because they tip them over and make a mess on the garage floor.

&#x200B;

* African Greys CANNOT live alone

The remaining AG will eventually suffer from several health issues, such as self-mutilation, which can lead to permanent bald spots, anxiety, depression, chronic loneliness and stress, and many more.

&#x200B;

One thing I'd like to add is that the neighbor is very rich. He has 2 BMW SUVs and a van in the garage. I told the maid to tell him about my offer to buy perches and toys and have him pay me back for them, but he never contacted me. I gave my contact details 3 times and never heard back.

I wrote him a [letter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gLth4JnGspJGYNns9M62xGGgP7FvACasSpu6ESERKLU/edit?usp=sharing) which I slipped under their door last week.

There are a few more reasons, but that's the summary of it. I plan to contact PAWS to report him, but I don't know if they will do anything.

Thank you all for reading.
