Badly need an affordable therapist specializing in traumas around romantic relationships and sexual assault/harassment,"I struggle with dealing with very deep-seated traumas from the past around romantic love and sexual assault and harassment. It has badly affected my own relationship as well as my self-esteem, view of people, particularly men and sex. It has made me very depressed and terrified for so long that I believe its impact on my life needs serious intervention. I have been seeing therapists for years but none specialize in these specific traumas. Currently, I am a client under a trauma specialist but I find it difficult to be comfortable around them. I am also seeing a psychiatrist but I believe that a therapist specialized in these issues is something I am more in need of to save myself.

If anyone here knows one that is affordable (below ₱3,000), please let me know.

Thank you very much",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/1btwhdq/badly_need_an_affordable_therapist_specializing/,t2_3ag5npfo,2024-04-02 19:36:32,2,11
Trauma after Trauma.,"I was sexually harassed at my old job. The perpetrator was my general manager. After the said incidents I vented all out on my friend. I cried at him via phone call released all the rage, sadness, fear and despair that I was feeling. He knows I’m mentally diagnosed with Bipolar II. The incident really took a mental health toll on me. Imagine the pain, the depression, the trauma I experienced at work. After our call this friend of my mine said “Mahina kasi mental health mo, kaya nangyari sayo yan” and I don’t know what to say since I just vented out yung trauma ko tapos natraumatized pa ako sa sinabi ng friend ko. I mean is it my fault just because I have mental health issues kaya ko deserve yung nangyari sa akin?

I reported him,"I reported my co-worker for sexual harassment. Do I need to seek professional help? Or Please convince me to seek professional help.

I really cannot explain why I feel this way.

Recurring symptoms:
- Panicking when I know we’ll have interactions
- Messed up sleep patterns( I wake up atleast 3 times because of uneasiness)
- Constant stomachache 
- Breaking down so easily when asked about the topic
- Losing appetite because of stress

For context, I work night shifts so my sleep can be affected by that but I’m not sure. I just know that I cannot fully focus on work because of the incident and I’m exhausted after having a good cry.

Thinking of ending it all,"Hi, I don't know what to do or who to talk with, pero all this started when i worked with a call center na may logo na Q, i was inappropriately touched by a trans coworker and was also being bullied because i was hitting the daily quota, beating some of my wave mates na kasabayan ko i tried helping them naman, pero for some reason sales really vibed with me and i found it easy pero no matter how good i am at work i always felt like an outcast and when i brought this up to HR, they never made an action, so i resigned and i brought a med cert from a psychiatrist, since the bullting and the harassment by the trans woman really fucked me up, i went to get another job but after a month, the client decided to let go of some workers kasi we were receiving a small amount of calls only and i was one of those who were let go kasi baguhan pa lang, now it's been 2 days palang na I'm jobless pero shit, i feel so bad not to mention i found out na my submission na artwork in a local museum was accepted but i found out na di pala siya dinisplay during the duration of the exhibit because apparently i wasn't good enough and they had favorites from other organizations that submitted artworks, masaklap pa, ako lang yung may artwork na di dinisplay, and one ex co worker na alam yung nireport ko sa hr ng old call center that i worked for told me that trans pala yung head ng hr namin kaya possible na di daw sineryoso yung sexual harassment case na nireport ko. I feel so fucking powerless, I don't know what to fucking do anymore, i feel like giving up, isa nalang rason ko to continue, it's my girlfriend, for some reason she's still here pero I'm afraid na baka iwan niya din ako because parang downward spiral ngayon ang buhay ko tang ina.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/162kgjx/thinking_of_ending_it_all/,t2_8h5hstng,2023-08-27 16:11:03,8,2
Iba pala talaga kapag sayo na nangyare,"Been thinking of things to do when an instance happen. One of this is when being sexually harassed or rap*d.

But then it happened to me. I didn't violently confronted it like what I always imagined. He was forcing himself to me multiple times, I kept pushing him off, and telling him to just sleep... but luckily, he didn't have enough strength to keep me restrained.

Both of us got drunk from a small get together.

I didn't scream nor ask for help because I tried to be rational and thought that he was just too drunk and I still am in the right mind somehow to escape the situation. 

Writing this now, I should've known better and just kicked him in the balls or elbowed him when he was being too touchy during the drink.

I didn't go to the Police Station to file a report because I don't what this to be engraved to people's memory of me. 

*TLDR*: I'm a man, this happened to me for the first time, and I don't know how to handle this situation.

It’s my birthday,"Hello reddit friends. Yeah it will be my birthday in about 10 minutes as I am writing this down. 

There are some thoughts going on my mind these past few days. I know there are some people who wants to celebrate their birthday like a normal day. But I am still struggling if I should celebrate it or not although I experienced not celebrating it before. This year is different for me. I have no friends to celebrate this with. When I celebrated before, I am going out with my friends. It was fun yeah but this year I realized something. I realized they are not my friends. Two of them sexually harassed me while I am sleeping and drunk. My best friend since high school betrayed me with my ex. The rest of them were not in my vibe anymore. I cut them off on all my social medias except my best-friend. It was difficult for me to cut her off. I loved her really and she’s supportive of me. However, I still cannot forget what she had done with my ex before. We talked about that. She said sorry and cried. I forgave her but damn it still hurts though the situation happened before pandemic.

I am not a family-oriented person. So when celebrations like this comes I don’t participate. Family issues name it. I just hang-out with my friends and go on. Maybe that’s the reason I brushed off  those issues with my friends before. Because I don’t want to lose them. I hate this side of me for letting those people hurt me and not confronting them about it.

Is this okay for cutting them off? And I don’t really know what to do to my best-friend. What should I do? 

I am thinking whether to treat myself in the mall and go to a resto bar and drink to this endless loneliness and void. Or just lay down

I have PTSD and depression and graduated cum laude," \[TW: Sexual harassment/rape, suicide\]

I am diagnosed with PTSD and Persistent Depressive Disorder.

I find it difficult to start since most people would be surprised when I tell them this. How did I, the loud, jolly, and smiling classmate, had these diagnoses? I had everything I needed: I grew up with my family, lived a comfortable life, studied in a prestigious school, and achieved high marks. All I had to do was go to school and study, right?

When I was in elementary, I experienced sexual harassment which caused my trauma. The details will not be shared for my privacy, but people often think that after a traumatic experience, everything becomes okay again, right? For the abuser, it was just an ordinary day. For other people, it is just a small sin that can be easily forgotten (“forgive and forget”). But for the victim, we would always remember. Our body holds their sins and it weighs us down.

My childhood flew by and before I knew it, I was in high school. I was aware of my past, and it did hurt, but I tried my best to move on. That’s what everybody says, right? Just move on.

But what people don’t know is how we experience our trauma and grief. They don’t know the times we asked ourselves what we did wrong - what did I, a five-year-old at that time, do? People don’t understand how much we blame ourselves and how difficult it is to speak up and how to forget everything because everything is overwhelming everything keeps moving so fast fast fast and we have to smile we can’t speak about it people don’t believe us we have to be okay we have to move on we have to move move move. 

And so, I tried. I went to school everyday, did my homework diligently, and remained a loving daughter. I took care of my physical health by minding my nutrition, working out, and even doing yoga. On the outside, really, everyone could see how I had an easy life.

I hope you never get to experience 10:00PM in your room feeling afraid, feeling the closing of your throat, feeling dizzy and afraid and nervous and scared because you know you’re safe in your house but you don’t feel because you feel hand hands hands touching you. You feel and see and remember the event happening again and again he’s here he’s touching you and I can’t do anything I scrub my body and wash my body but I still feel his hands imprinted on me. So I cry in silence and hope the pain will go away, and yet it never does. Praying didn’t make it go away. Smiling didn’t make it go away. Studying didn’t make it go away. 

It was particularly difficult during the pandemic because I spent my days in our house, seeing the same four walls for two years. The nightmares got worse and repeated again and again the fear remained and sometimes would leave but would come right back. I don’t understand why does it hurt why does it hurt WHY DOES IT STILL HURT I AM 21 YEARS OLD AND IT HAPPENED WHEN I WAS 5 WHY DOES IT MATTER I didn’t understand I was so lost, afraid, week, and sad. I still see it I still feel it I feel so afraid, so small, so sad. Why am I not happy why does it still hurt why am I like this? During panic attacks my hands were numb, my brain heavy and dizzy, I was smiling and laughing with other people but my chest hurt, my chest feels heavy, my hands are shaking, I feel my heart palpitate but I smile and I nod. Ultimately, the pain was too much to bear. The flashbacks and fear were so intense that I wanted to overdose and just sleep so I won’t feel it again. When I was in my third year, just before laboratory and clinicals, I was hospitalized because of a suicide attempt of overdosing my dormmate's sleeping pills

I asked for help. It was the first time my parents and brother knew what I was going through. It felt new telling other people my experience. It was my first time when I didn’t need to hide the nightmares, the flashbacks, and panic attacks. I remember how difficult it was for me to see my family cry, especially to see how Mama sobbed and wished she could carry my pain. It was also difficult to get used to the side effects of the medications. It took months of medications and therapy to process my trauma. 

Don't get me wrong: I still have flashbacks. I still cry. I am still on medications and therapy. But I also graduated as a cum laude. I had a scholarship for the review center I was looking at. I am preparing for boards. And I am actually in love with living. Sure, there are times when I feel heavy and depressed, but there are also brighter days - lighter days when I can really smile.

I hope that our generation will know that mental health is important, and people with mental illnesses can achieve their dreams. I want people to know that I am depressed and I made it. I had a serious mental illness and I graduated as a cum laude. To you, who are reading this, who doubt yourself, and who have experienced these as well, it is still possible to dream. Yes, you are depressed, you are a victim, but you are so much more than that.

Mental health is a serious issue. I encourage everyone to support their family members and friends who are going through a rough time.

If you are looking for a sign, this is your sign. You matter. You deserve to be in this world. Seek help, especially professional help to process the things that bring you down. It is okay to feel pain. It is okay to feel sad. You are still worthy. Time will tell how amazing you will be.

You deserve to be alive. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/15pu2qb/i_have_ptsd_and_depression_and_graduated_cum_laude/,t2_3srzd7vc,2023-08-13 17:06:45,33,1
Am I right to be upset about what my friend did to me?,"Hi. Im am 17 and I am in sixth form. Last night i attended a 18th birthday party. A lot of my schools friends were there including this boy. This boy is in my drama class and he has a girlfriend who is a friend of mine and she is also in my drama class. This guy is rather touchy but he is like this with everyone so I thought it was purely in his nature to be touchy. Recently me and his girlfriend got into a bit of an argument but it was kept very civil and I was very nice to her during the party. And the boy and me were also on good terms. He was dancing with me, talking to me and it was all ok. A few of my friends including him and me had gone out into the garden to get some fresh air. I took my shoes off because I was wearing heels and they were uncomfortable. I then gave my phone to this guy so I could put my shoes again. He walked away to talk some of my other friends. When I put my shoes back on I went to get my phone from him. He turned to me and held the top of my tank top, pulled it and dropped the phone in my bra. I was shocked and had nothing to say I remember saying something like “oh ok?” And walked away just feeling a bit violated. I went to my friend and she clearly new that something was wrong and she asked me what happened. I told her and she said that it wants okay. I was quite distressed for the rest of the evening and was crying. I avoided him the rest of the night and some of my friends were trying to help me feel better. Im not sure if what he did is considered sexual harassment or he purely didn’t realise what he did and had no bad intentions. Maybe he just thought it would be a good way to make sure I didn’t loose my phone. Im really not sure, all ik is I was uncomfortable Im starting to question of im just being dramatic and overthinking what happened. Maybe I should forget it and move one. 

Do I confront him about what happened? I have to be in the same class with him for the next year and there are only 5 students in my drama class so I’m not sure if it would just make things worse if I talk to him. Im really confused. This is clearly affecting me and iv been feeling very panicky but a part of me feels like I shouldn’t be affected and he didn’t mean to do it. Im really not sure how I should feel or what I should do about it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/16qwu5j/am_i_right_to_be_upset_about_what_my_friend_did/,t2_jsl7g2nnx,2023-09-24 20:42:10,1,1
Why do I have to suffer from someone else's sexual pleasure,"Ever since this monster came in to my life, my crappy life turned worse. This demon won't leave me alone, it all started at the first month of 2021. I was already almost dying from covid and then this thing entered my life.

It first came in sexually assaulted me then it harassed and molested me up until this day, my private area hurts and always forced to pleasure every single day. It fucking hurts and this thing never stops touching me. Unfortunately I couldn't handle it anymore, I think I will die. 

Why? did this monster want from me, I just want to be loved, this parasite keeps making me worse each day, its bad enough this fucking thing made it worser. Fucking piece of shit, took advantage of my emotional weakness. Unfortunately I don't think anyone will believe me, even so I just want to say it here, to get this pain off a bit.

My mind is getting worse, it might get twisted. But thankfully it was maintained enough.

I just want to live, if I happen to die early, hopefully I can be a comic artist in next life. I always admired stories, they helped me a lot especially in troubled times.

my family is so unfair and it’s making me depressed,"I just want to rant on here because to be honest I don’t have someone to vent these feelings with. Since the pandemic up until now, my family has been heavily relying on me with everything. They even forced me to have a job after graduating high schoo. Now I initially didn’t have a problem with this because I genuinely want to help them even though hindi na ako nakaproceed ng college. Like I said I was okay with it, but when I had a problem with my job because I was mistreated and sexually harassed by my coworkers for being trans, I quit. Now with my savings I tried going back to school but I also applied for a scholarship and I passed so I thought everything was going better. Fast forward now, the school year ended. We had another crisis and I had to stop school. I was thinking of getting a WFH job because I live in a small city and we barely have opportunities. It was not easy for me to find a remote job because I really don’t have the skills for it or maybe I have but it’s only limited so I was getting depressed. Now my mom is getting agitated kasi daw I didn’t find any opportunities and mind you I have to fund for my laptop that I was going to use. She kept guilt tripping me to earn more money even though I am contributing half the bills with my side hustles online and this maybe isnt that bad if I didn’t have a 24 year old brother who doesn’t do anything but play computer games on his pc 24/7 and doesn’t even help with chores or anything like that, verbally abusive pa to me and my mom, but the confusing thing was she kept defending him like he was angel even though he does nothing but abuse us and our resources. He’s also very demanding with the food and everything else but she kept defending him but gets mad at me for every little thing. I’m so sick of it and I don’t know what to do and I can’t escape them or else they’ll call me selfish or possibly disown me and I don’t have a family. It’s just so unfair lang cause she also defended my sister who got pregnant nung teenager palang siya and she was even spoiled cause we were at a good place financially at the time. Yet she acts like she’s also an angel even though my sister stole our appliances and lied about something to get money from my parents just to go to Siargao with her boyfriend and bragged about it on social media, but when she had a problem with her kidneys, my parents were so quick to sell our car and everything else but yes she didn’t do anything wrong and that she’s an angel. She’s 26 now and I’m thr youngest in the family (21). This is so mentally draining and to be honest I already attempted to off myself but I managed to stop. I just want others opinion about this and how can I make my situation better. I feel so lost and exhausted. It’s getting very painful. I might give up soon…I have nowhere to go and I can’t trust anyone",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/16e7xcx/my_family_is_so_unfair_and_its_making_me_depressed/,t2_vklkhq01,2023-09-09 23:02:53,5,5
i feel so numb and its so draining,"tw: this will contain mention of suicide 


for the past year and a half i have been unable to connect with people on the same level that i used to. at first i thought it was cause i have trust issues, but i also made the connection that its hard for me to find lovers/ actually love and care for someone. 

a handful of things triggered me to be this way. a friend, a while back, had ended her life and in her suicide note she blamed me for it. i dont know where she was buried but even if i did i dont think id have the guts to go visit. i lost friends and lovers over the mere fact that they saw me as broken. i had saved a couple of friends from committing but i no longer speak to them nor do i know if they tried again (and possibly succeeded). and a while back i transferred schools because ig i pissed someone off and rumors spread that i was having a sexual relationship with a teacher, and later i got harassed and called names. the term “teacher fucker” being the popular one. after a while i became destructive, i started to hurt people out of anger which put more of a strain on my mental health. i gave up on everything and later attempted suicide a handful of times.

after that had happened everything changed, something inside me just snapped. i became angry, and just mentally drained in general. i was able to make friends and went through a relationship but i cant bring myself to feel anything significant towards them. i care about them in the sense that ik they have emotions and that they can feel things but i cant understand their emotions and feelings in the same way they may understand. i view them as place holders, ppl that i speak to, but not friends. not people that i can create a bond with, i see them as a threat. nothing more. 

i do feel guilty that they are getting the most broken version of me. that my friends and potential future partners will have to deal with such emotional withdrawal.

is there any way to fix this, or am i a lost cause?",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/18ncnar/i_feel_so_numb_and_its_so_draining/,t2_cc513yh4,2023-12-21 10:59:02,3,2
I'm almost flipping out,"I am 30M. I will tell you about my story briefly. I grew up in an environment full of women. My parents were together, but you know on paper only. I have a father who loves me so much, and he has been physically there with me, but he left my mother with all the responsibilities and emotional needs that should have been a guide for a son and he lived his own life.

I have always been bullied by boys around me just because I had not been swearing, not speaking inappropriately about girls, or objectifying them. They considered me gay, incomplete, or ""less than a man"". I suffered a long period of abuse in childhood. When I started middle school, I was in a relationship with the most beautiful girl in the school and we stayed in a relationship for 2.5 years, but even then I kept hearing all those insults. At some point, I started to question if they might be right, why I couldn't convince them, and why I couldn't be a ""real man"", just like one of them.

My perspective shifted and I went into a great darkness, I had no idea who I was anymore and I lived almost my whole life in this darkness. I had girlfriends, and I had long-lasting relationships, but I was never able to surrender to a woman, I never let myself go, I never allowed myself to let anyone love me, and I never allowed myself to really love anyone.

On the other hand, I lived my whole life observing the other men around me. On streets, on a bus, in the sauna or gym, etc. Those men became an object for me and I started to compare myself with them by seeing their more masculine side than mine such as being hairier, having sharper features, being more muscular, having a bigger penis, appearing more fearless, having more possessive attitudes, and so on... So, I started to humiliate myself and believe me, this humiliation started to give me pleasure somehow. I was trapped in a cycle where I created situations to humiliate myself and then I suffered.

Then something happened. I met a man 2.5 years ago and he was exactly the perfect example of the object of my self-abasement. But things turned out the way I didn't expect. He didn't humiliate me, he didn't belittle me, he didn't harass me, he wasn't rude to me. He saw me, my inner pain, he showed me his own wounds. He was there for me, he supported me when I cried.

Here's what I can't figure out right now. That man has been so good to me that I have become so attached to him, I can say that I'm co-dependent now. I don't want to live without him, I want to go with him wherever he goes, I want to do what he does. We have been spending so much time together for the last 2.5 years. He has become the center of my life. It's kind of a bromance-like relationship or sometimes I call it ""philia"", he is straight and he is not a sexual object for me, BUT I'm so confused. I really have a hard time understanding if I'm in love with this man, if I'm really gay, or if something else is going on, like after all these years of experience, I was shocked to meet such a person or something.

I have been in therapy for 2.5 years. EMDR has helped me a lot to get rid of my childhood traumas, but unfortunately, I feel too frozen to move now. Where have all my emotions gone, where are my sexual urges, where have my positive emotions gone, who am I, what do I want? I am completely in the unknown and my depression is getting deeper and deeper each day.

I really need someone to talk to me, even if you can't offer a solution. I want to hear something.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/17prlq9/im_almost_flipping_out/,t2_ncugab1vv,2023-11-07 18:48:30,7,2
the country does not have MH resources for my condition. kuwento na rin.,"Hopeless case nga talaga ako. I've been to the best hospitals and therapists/doctors in the NCR area. One of which told my mom that I will never be happy, so they will just focus on giving me things to do. Unfortunately I heard that, but it happens to be true.

\[long story, pasensya na po\]

I have autism that went undiagnosed until I was 20something because of the stigma. Even though all the signs were there. Pinabayaan ako. Looking back, kahit magkasakit ako o mainjure sa school walang may paki. Nung grade one ako, nadapa ako sa semento nung may sack race at dumugo ang siko ko. Pumasok lang ako sa klase na nagdudugo sa panyo ko, walang pumansin kahit pag-uwi ko. And I was clueless kaya di rin ako pumunta sa clinic. Tiniis ko lang kung anong sakit ng tiyan o lagnat o bali natamo ko noong bata ako up to high school or college. Nanakawan ako ng wallet sa unang college ko at parang wala lang. I had no friends and thought it was my fault so I made extra efforts, joined clubs. Wala pa rin. Kapag may problema ako nawawala lahat ng akala ko friends ko.

I probably did and said a lot of weird things too but I did not mean bad and nobody corrected me. Was just ostracized for the most part, not actually bullied. I even went on a date with a stranger one night and I was so proud of myself for being brave. Buti nalang sinabihan ako ng kabatch ko na creepy ang nangyari at wag nang makipagkita dun. At least that friend saved me in that case kasi the guy was stroking my thigh during the trip and took me back to the dorm so he knew where I stayed. Creepy nga in hindsight pero sobrang tanga ko. I was 16 and living far from home. I never told my family about this. It was shortly after that incident that my wallet was stolen. Nung nadepress ako nung taon na yun, my family just assumed it was because of the lost wallet. But actually it was a lot of things, including losing the friend who gave the advice as well as the creepy guy. Even now I wonder, what if I didn't listen to her and went with him?

Suggestion ng friends ko online na tumawag ako sa suicide hotline. The problem is I have severe sensory and processing issues. In short di ko kaya tumawag sa phone. I can type a lot of text because I'm only focusing on one thing. Pero pag live conversation overwhelmed na ako. I can't even VC with my own friends, how can I talk to a stranger? Lahat ng suicide hotline sa Pinas walang chat support haha, nagmessage ako sa FB nila. Mamatay nalang kaya ako hahahaha.

Lahat ng mga resources dito for autism ay para sa mga bata at early interventions. Nung bata ako wala pa yung asperger's o high functioning autism kaya walang maitulong sa akin. Now it's too late. Ibuhos ko nalang lahat dito at baka sakali magkatapang akong tapusin buhay ko. Nobody takes my disability seriously anyway. I can't go for online therapy because of the talking problem. Walang combination ng meds na gumana sa akin. Worse, lumala yung health ko. I became obese and developed asthma. Sirang-sira rin ang sleeping patterns ko. All those health problems didn't exist before I took psych meds. Kasi nga nagdoble effort ako nung una, sumali ako sa sports clubs, tried to live healthy and be social.

Pag may nangyaring incident o may problema ako, ako ang sinisisi. Kahit nung nagwowork ako at unfair ang mga boss ko. They would talk behind my back about me and my coworkers. It got so bad na dalawa ang nagquit kaya in the end ginagawa ko trabaho ng tatlong tao, three different offices pinupuntahan ko. And they also accused me of something I would never do, that is to badmouth them to a higher authority. Kasi, not to name names pero working student ako nun. Sa state university ako nagtatrabaho pero sa city college ako nag-aaral. Sinisiraan nila sa work yung city college ko. To the point na mas gusto pa nilang mag-aral sa private school and mga bata na hindi nakapasa sa kanila kaysa mag-aral sa public din. Sabi-sabi na aagawin daw ng city college ang pondo ng state uni. At naniwala naman ang mga bata. Bakit ko naman sila isusumbong sa city eh hindi naman ako close sa mga boss dun? Pero ang masakit talaga ay yung mga accusation sa amin ng mga coworkers ko. Panay ang siraan nila sa isa, slow at bobo daw (pero college grad, paano nangyari yun?), yun pala PWD din siya, mahina ang tenga. Nagkaroon ng incident at kailangan magleave nung taong yun pero nung babalik na, ayaw tanggapin. At the time I was already doing the work of three so we really needed the help. Actually anim ang nirerequest namin na staff. Kahit sino pa yan, sana kinuha na nila.

I had been begging my mom to help me transfer to a different department because it was getting toxic. Twice kinausap namin ng mga kawork ko si mama ko at once we consulted with the HR pero di nila kami nilipat. And then came the almost sexual harassment incident. May three days na Lakbay Aral at sumama doon lahat ng admin pati karamihan ng prof. May isa akong kaclose na male prof, parang tatay ko na yun na naiwan sa campus. Mag-isa lang ako sa admin office noon at sinubukan niya akong halikan sa labi. Natakot ako at sinabi ko sa mama ko at sa immediate superior ko. Kinausap ni mama yung boss ko at sinabing wag akong iiwan mag-isa sa office. Hindi ko siya kinasuhan ng sexual harassment kasi mawawalan ng pension yung prof kung may kaso siya.

Later on gusto ko na talagang umalis sa work ko dahil nga sa hindi nila pagtanggap sa kawork ko. As in gusto kong patayin ang boss ko dahil sa discrimination nila against PWDs. Nalaman nila yun at nagsecret meeting yung admin at mom ko. Edi ang resulta, mag-isa nanaman ako sa admin office at walang maisagot sa mga clients. Ayos, diba? Nakatanggap ako ng angry call from parents saka mga special visitors at wala akong masabi, walang bilin kahit kay kuya guard man lang. We didn't know if the admins will be back and when. Nakakahiya sobra. My mom betrayed me and sided with the bosses who were abusing us PWDs and accusing us of things we didn't do. Nagkaroon kasi ng nakawan sa school kaya lahat kaming staff suspect. Pero yung job orders ang pinag-initan. Pagbalik nila, kinausap ako ng campus director kunwari friendly, yun pala pinapagleave ako. Pero nung sinabi ko problema ko tinawanan lang ako. He mocked me. Sabi joke lang daw yung sinabi sa faculty meeting na baka ako daw nagsabi sa city admin na nilalabanan nila yung city college. Joke? May tumawa ba? May nagdepensa ba sa akin, iclear man lang pangalan ko? Wala. Nagwala ko and the next thing I know, I was being pinned down by two men sa labas ng opisina. Bisita lang yung isa at hawak niya leeg ko. Parang gusto pang higpitan sa leeg para takutin ako. As if. I wanted to kill and be killed, suicidal na ako noon kaya walang masama kung tuluyan nila ako. Ganyan sila mga normie/neurotypical, lahat ng problema kasalanan ng may mental illness. Ngayon alam ko nang wala akong kakampi kahit saan man ako magpunta. Isisisi lang sa akin lahat ng aberya. Kaming mga PWD at may mental issues ang laging nilalaglag. Sinisira nila ang mga pagkatao at buhay namin.

Pero di pa din nagtapos kalbaryo ko. Nawalan na nga ako ng trabaho pero tuloy pa rin paninira nila sa akin. May estudyante kasi na scholar, bagong graduate na kaibigan naming mga staff at crush ko. He had financial problems, self-supporting at mukhang on the spectrum din. Pinahiraman ko ng reviewer for CPA. Nanakawan siya ng pera na supposed to be para sa grad fee. Pag-graduate niya ay binigyan ko siya ng konting pera at graduation gift. Nagkataong nanakawan ulit siya after kong matanggal sa trabaho, at nahuli niya yung magnanakaw. Yung ka-staff ko na nagquit pero di pinilit bumalik. Akala namin kaibigan siya but she was manipulating us to think she was sympathetic tapos ganoon nga. Ninakawan mga scholars na gipit na nga sa pera. Tapos bibigay siyang konting tulong para mukha siyang mabait. Inutangan pa ako para mapakita lang na di siya magnanakaw. Unfortunately ang alam nitong scholar-graduate ay kakutsaba din ako. He wrote a long post on FB accusing both the thief and myself of manipulating and stealing from him, and at the same time, blocked me so I can't explain my side. As far as I know, nobody corrected him for my sake.

Pasensya na po sa mahabang story time/rant. Nabubuwisit na ako sa hopeless kong kalagyan. Kung tutuusin nga ay delikado kung maghanap pa ako ng trabaho, considering how easy it is for people to manipulate me baka next time ma-r\*pe ako o mawalan ng malaking halaga o maligaw sa Manila - and then I will still be the one to blame oh diba ang saya?

Sooooooo Lost on my life path,"Hello mga ka reddit. I'm a 26F full time bpo worker. Feel ko reddit lang yung way ko na makapag vent out anonymously. 

Came from a very dysfunctional family. Long story short, I have a tita na ang tawag ko ay mommy dahil since birth siya na ang nag alaga sa akin, kinda adopted setup. Kapatid siya ng biological father ko. No comms ako sa biological parents except sa isang kuya ko na anak ng biological mom with a different man.

Before nag ka anak si mommy, ako lang yung meron siya and may kaya kami. She even have a taxi business so lahat ng luho like jb birthday parties and everything na experience ko. When she had her own children, dun nag bago trato niya sakin. Nung nagkaroon siya ng partner which I used to call Daddy everything went downhill. Tho happy naman siya ng light pa. Nung pinanganak niya na yung first daughter nia dun na nagbago yung trato niya sakin. I guess I was a child na ubod ng kulit but hurtful things were said na sana hindi na lang niya ako kinuha and the way na I discovered na hindi niya ako anak is yung sinabi niya na hindi ko kapatid yung baby niya. That young me suddenly changed from a happy go lucky and pala study na bata, I lost all interest for those things. After nun, lagi na pinapatawag ng mga teachers ko sila mommy. Tuwing may meeting sa school, walang na attend ng student parent meeting, if meron man hindi si mommy. As time goes by, palala ng palala yung panunumbat niya and pambubugbog. There was even one time na nakipag laro lang ako sa school mate ko and when I went home, hinambalos niya ako ng makapal na kahoy sa leg and knee area ko which caused me to have difficulties on walking the following day. My school mate even asked me if I was ok kasi nakita pala niya paano ako nabugbog nun. Tumagal yung ganyang setup namin hanggang sa grumaduate ako ng elementary.

2nd heartbreak is Graduation Day ko, I was hoping na maybe pupunta sia but boy I was so wrong, pinakiusapan niya yung bantay ng sari sari store namin na samahan ko sa graduation ko. Inintindi ko na lng din na mas priority nia ung business nia. During that, I can't help it but I cried nung may segment where students will approach their parents kasi inggit na inggit at the same time sobrang lungkot ko kasi I felt so alone that time. Same scenario din nung ALS Graduation ko hindi rin sia pumunta pero bestfriend ko ang sumama sakin which I was really grateful for her.

When I was in college, nagkaroon ng incident na I got sexually harassed and molested none other than the person whom I trusted and tinuring kong father figure which was her partner. Nung nagsumbong ako kay MOMMY, I already expected her reaction na hindi siya maniniwala na kayang gawin yun ng partner niya kasi all this time ang nakikita niya sakin is nothing but a good for nothing liar. That was my 3rd heartbreak na kung sino pa ang kamag anak ko siya pa ang hindi maniniwala. That incident still haunts me up until this day and might be the main cause of me developing Bipolar Disorder with Anxiety and Post Traumatic Disorder. Clinically diagnosed.

Ngayong 26 na ako, even ganun nangyari sakin di ko magawang iwanan si mommy and ang mga kinilala kong kapatid which is mga anak niya na pinsan ko. Up to this day never pa din nawawala panunumbat niya everytime na may bad day siya. I had several scde attempts before because of being verbally abused and everytime na nag brebreak down ako. All I want now is to help my 2 cousins na makatapos ng studies nila. Tinitiis ko na lang lahat ng masasakit na sumbat ng mom nila because I love those two as my own sibs.

Right now mga ka reddit, I'm so lost na hindi ko alam ano bang purpose ko. Hindi ko alam if lalaban pa ba ako. I may sound a cry baby pero pagod na pagod na ako. Everytime na mag brebreak down ako di lang siya masakit emotionally buong katawan ko sumasakit. Maybe meron kayong mashashare na tips how to fight this?. Sessions with my psychiatrist is only helping a little but nothing more than that",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/153ph5z/sooooooo_lost_on_my_life_path/,t2_h0ayahq7,2023-07-19 16:55:42,2,1
Interpersonal Issues,"So basically I'm feeling terrible today, and I think I have every right to feel this way (no one will validate me so I'll validate myself Haha).

I am right where I began. The quicksand that I have always been trying to escape caught me right in the middle of it. Maybe I am just this dumb.

This quicksand that I am talking about is the idea of being a passive-aggressive bully or harasser. I mean it's the idea where you make 'parinig' to a certain person without admitting that you were pertaining to that person. This may sound like a children's normal teasing games but when adults do it, the possibilities are unlimited. It can exploit your weaknesses and insecurities, cause emotionally distress or simply subtly hurt someone WITHOUT them being responsible for their own words because hey, they weren't pertaining to you right (gaslighting)? Them being allowed to do things with impunity make their bullying transcend from simply teasing someone's physical appearance to extreme measures as to attack your sexual preferences, traumatic experiences, question your very existence and even provoke you to do unthinkable things. Basically though blades cut the skin, it is actually words that cut and scar the soul. Basically I am almost experiencing this on a regular basis, I am starting to accept that fact maybe this is really the world we live in. But still, it affects me in times when I feel vulnerable.

But my issue is not that. It's just that, whenever I speak or post or voice out my opinion or just be myself I feel like people actually think that it was I (the passive-aggressive bully) that was verbally attacking them. That makes me think that the only way to live is to shut my mouth, play dead and not to do anything just to offend nobody. But the idea is, although I think and I know that I don't do it to them, they feel like I am doing it to them. The very idea of what I hate about people is probably the very idea of what they hate about me. I have always been prone to being misunderstood. That was the quicksand that I was talking about, being in the position where because you didn't do anything even if you seemingly understand everything, you will end up being the reservoir of those tensions, to put it lightly. The reason why I try my best not to resort to these, even if it's seemingly normal, is that it is prone to misinterpretation, like as if I am not misinterpreted already just by being my normal self.

I kinda don't care now if I sound confusing, Haha.

So to prevent that from happening again what I did is that in my few circle of friends I always clarify that I am NOT trying to bully them or some sort, but even with this disclaimer I feel like they still get offended by everything I do, albeit unintentional. Matalim nga lang siguro tabas ng dila ko, but it was never malicious nor intentional. But guess what, they no longer trust me. Haha. They actually think that I am lying.

I am just tired of how my brain work. Yung tipong overactive ang brain ko to the point that I overthink what people might overthink about, as if overthinking my own problems wouldn't suffice.
