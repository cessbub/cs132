Anyone here who had been abused by a Covert Narc?,"I wanna ask this because it greatly affected my mental health. And from what I have read, you wouldn’t know you’re with a Narcissist and soft spoken manipulator until you left. Sure there may be signs but when you’re infected by the love bug, I guess you’re blind as I was. 
For context, I am a Bi-Femme. Recently got out of a same sex relationship. My first one. And yes I know, pure pain lol

I just had booked a session with one of the vouched psych here and I wanted to express gratitude with people here who are active in responding back. I was diagnosed with MDD back in January 2023 pero ang hirap to get in touch back with your doctor sa PGH so I opt for a paid consultation after months of waiting and trying. 

Lemme know folks. Looking for people who can share and hopefully tell me how they cope up with it while I wait for my consultation day.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/1aswcga/anyone_here_who_had_been_abused_by_a_covert_narc/,t2_g02xmxlbh,2024-02-17 15:31:49,5,5
Re: Abused Children's Grief After Parents Death,"[NEED HELP] Hello po! First time posting here. I'm a Psychology major and we're currently conducting a study on how abused children grieve (or not grieve) after parents death. 

I know that abuse has been prevalent in the Philippines, specially that corporal punishment is deemed as discipline--toxic parenting, btw.

Nagbabakasakali lang po na baka may willing magparticipate sa study namin. We will send an informed consent right away. You have your right for privacy and confidentiality, and benefits, among others. 

Requirements:
- Was abused by a parent and that parent is already dead now
- Any form of abuse (emotional, physical, sexual, or neglect)
- Must be 18 years old and above

Please DM me/comment in this thread if interested po, please please.

abusive vs. Discipline,"I (29F) am a mental health enthusiast trying to uncover what exactly is considered wrong and correct in this culture we call 'Filipino'.

I have parents who are abusive and while we do have good times, I don't see them as respectable people in terms of attitude. I don't see them as parental figures in my life. 
I am thankful that they put me through school, but it's true what they say, 'Financial support doesn't count as parental support, because that's their duty.' There are other instances but it would take too long to write/type down. 

Where do we filipinos draw the line between abuse and pure discipline? My dad would get mad when we would do something wrong, but when we also express our frustration towards him, he would say 'If you don't like it here, you can leave where the rent costs 20k or 30k hindi pa kasama electricity and food.' He said he's giving me guidance pa pero sinasakal ako bc I can't go out or whatever without ASKING him. There is a difference between 'Can I go' vs. 'I will go here and will be back by this time.' I have to do the former not the latter. 

 There was one recent instance pa where my dad talked down my mom saying things like 'Do you not know who i am? Do you think I'm stupid?' Idk, but i think that's stupid.... right? 

What frustrates me even more is my mom would say sorry and nagmamakaawa. I told myself, 'My marriage will be 100000x better than that.'

Need Help for Substance Abuse Guy,"Good day to everyone.  I'm an aimless, 40-something guy currently facing the consequences of my happy-go-lucky life.  I was somewhat OK before the pandemic. I had a partner going for 10 years.  I had tickets for overseas travel, my first foreign trip ever. I had cared for my business and thought of creating or expanding a new line. I was able to accomplish my responsibilities even when money was tight.  I was naive but happy, living in the clouds while my partner held the strings to keep me grounded in reality.

Sadly, I was exposed to the evils of drug use - I was able to manage it because I still love the simple joys that we had with my partner, and drugs kind of clashed with my fitness goals.   Then the COVID outbreak happened.  To keep it short, I'm now trying to recover from all that substance abuse that I did for 4 years. My partner and I ended up separated after 12 years. It was a futile attempt to save each other from my toxic behavior.  My family is now the talk of the town due to my childlike ""sabog"" behavior.  I do know, as people are very open when they talk about me, that I control my family because I was suicidal - initially from trying to escape my reality, but now more on the anxieties and paranoia from all the mistakes I had done.

I am trying to live with these anxieties and paranoia even if people talk about me. It's hard trying to keep moving and trying not to second guess yourself.  My mind kept spiraling down on a slope of regrets and self-punishment.  I kept yelling at myself at weird times whenever I remembered that I did a mistake that day. My mind isn't functioning normally when I'm interacting with anyone, be it a stranger or a family member, but it's on hyperdrive when I'm alone with my thoughts, like right now.

My ex-partner is suffering from the same issues, but at least he found God.  Me, I'm just a buff palamunin who lost his business, friends, the trust of my family, his passions in life except for one, and his sense of self.  I have no confidence that I can even get employed at a BPO given my zero skills and I can barely communicate properly face to face. Yet somehow I am still trudging along, barely surviving with the help of my family, my ex-partner, a few friends, and pets.  I hope that 2024 will be better for all of us here.  

I know I am selfish, even I can see it from the tone of this post.  But I know I won't get better if I don't get help somehow.  My ex-partner keeps telling me that God is the Way, and I believe that since some of my most peaceful nights are when I am sincerely thankful for the blessings that God has given me. But I also believe that I need to talk to someone who knows how to deal with the likes of me - a delusional, paranoid, anxious, mentally damaged, substance abuser with ADHD-like tendencies.  What would you recommend to treat a person like me?  I was ready to throw the gauntlet and be put in jail, be confined, or even be ""tokhang""d because I was too open, but my family still believes in me, and I am grateful for that.  They see a brighter possibility for this damaged son, and I hope I can fulfill that before they finally rest.

Thank you for hearing me out. Again, I wish you all a better, healthier, and mentally stable 2024.

TL:DR - Recovering addict needs help. Also, he's like he's a clueless, tactless kid living with no repercussions.  What would you suggest for him to recover and move forward?

I think I'm experiencing ptsd TW:sexual abuse ,"Hi! I'm 24 years old (F), I'm a victim of sexual abuse when I was 7 years old and my abuser was my step dad. It only stopped when he cheated on my mom. My family doesn't have any clue about this cause my step dad threatened me that he will kill my family. Also, when I was 8 years old our neighbor was drunk and drag me to a dark place and keep on touching my private part and kissed me. Then, when I was high school, we moved to another place with my aunt and my mom already separated with my step dad. I thought, I could finally have a safe and happy childhood. Until, my cousin friend (which is also our neighbor) started to have interest on me and tried to rape me. My PE teacher in a public school in Mandaluyong (ABIS) blackmailed me ""babagsak nya daw ako at kung ano-ano pa"" just to do it with him. Why I didn't speak? First dahil may threat and second I'm afraid that no kne would believe me. I always woke up feeling that someone touched me. I can't sleep with other people or even with my family kasi feeling ko lagi may mangyayaring masama. I moved out our house last year cause I'm really not comfortable sharing rooms with anyone and I could pay nman. But, even when I'm alone natatakot pa rin ako. Ang dami pa ring what if.

hello (possible tw abt sh nd drug abuse ig),"hi im 21 (f) and um this is my first time posting here ,, i’ve been diagnosed with mdd and ptsd (+im also suspected to have bpd but i’ll go through a psychiatric evaluation soon) and whenever im frustrated, i have this tendency to hurt myself physically (ie cutting of wrist or if that’s not available i hit my head wd any metal thingy) to release the stress and stuff (it helps me calm down) 

but lately, since both are not entirely available anymore, i take 10-15 tablets of melatonin a day to calm myself nd stop myself from hitting my head nd stuff. but since im running out of those, i also take 5 paracetamols and 5 dextrometorphan. honestly any pills available i’ll be sure to take at least five per night to calm myself. 

before i know it, it became a coping mechanism. what do i do? i’ve told this to my therapist but it doesn’t seem to flag her as something i should be worried about?

lowkey thinking im just slowly preparing myself to take more pills bc day by day, the number i take increases. what do i do?

Multiple physical abuse at workplace by an Ex.,"I apologize if im posting in the wrong sub. I desperately need to get some insights and legal/relationship advice about a situation I'm in. (Long post ahead/Created a new account specifically for this) 

I (f29) was again physically attacked by an ex (29m) sa office last night,, we are both working on the same company. This has been going on for a year and we dated about a year and a half. I ended the relationship kanina lang ng umaga, nung nagka-chance ako, pero I need to know if its worth fighting for myself or aalis nalang ako sa trabaho and iiwan ang magandang opportunty and promotion na darating this coming 2024 after years of harwork. 


Background: We were atleast 8 months in nung nalaman ko na He's been taking his meds due to anger management and anxiety. Being the partner who was supportive and understanding, I embraced who he was wholeheartedly. The beginning of a relationship was definitely happy one despite of some serious antics kapag naggalit sya for just because reasons. Ex: hindi nya nagustuhan ang suot ko, at may nakausap ako na lalaki sa trabaho (I'm a trainer and that's what I do, I train people until they are fully equipped). At first, nakakayanan ko pa to, mura doon, mura dito, block dito, unblock doon, etc etc. I was very understanding and palagi ko naiisip na, baka nat-trigger lang ung anger issues nya. Kaya I adjusted, I listened to him, and basically just followed everything what he's been asking. Ups and dows, for a whole year and somehow we managed to still be happy and contented. 


Now, here comes anniv - may nakita akong nagtxt sa phone nya. His ""ex partner"". They have a beautiful daughter who is about 12 now and I myself is a single woman without a child. I knew the status from the get go as I was able to confirm that they are co-parenting and I also am in contact sa Mother nya. Nakita ko ung text about the Ex asking where he was. Nakipag-hiwalay ako ora mismo, at nagleave ako sa trabaho ng at least 1 week without asking for an explanation. 


His mother kept on calling me during these times and was the one asked me to listen to her Son's explanation. I gave in.

I listened to Him, he said that the reason why this ex was asking where he was kasi time na nya sa Anak nya. Naniwala ako. (Pero dito na lahat nagstart ang duda, at matitinding away namen)


Fast forward, nagstart na syang mamisikal everytime na umaalis ako sa relationship namin. Sampal, suntuk, sabunot, sipa, kurot, sakal. Name it. Nagawa na nya lahat to sakin. This is plus the name calling, degrading, cursing, and humiliating  sa labas kapag may hindi sya nagustuhan. Tyinetempo na mga pananakt nya kapag walang tao kung asan kame, (ex, parking, bahay, daan), pero madami times na napapansn na ng mga tao sa trabaho kung pano nya ako tratuhin.  Though these are very minimal kasi magaling syang tyumempo and kutob to. Ex, nakaharap ako sa PC, kunware may kukunin sya sa office table pero kukurutin nya ako ng malakas, and sure na magkakapasa. 


I'm done.

 I'm tired, and I'm thinking of ending my own life sa lahat ng pagsisisi ko sa buhay ko and for allowing a monster to do all of these to me. Galit ako sa sarli ko dahil sobrang bobo ko. I grew up na walang Father figure and looking back, nakikita ko ang mga magulang ko na nag-aaway at nagphyphyiscalan and when I met Him, he was able to condition me na He would be that "" right person"". 


Now, my only ask is. Anong pwede ko gawin? Is it worth it na labanan sya sa trabaho by reporting him which will also affect what other people perceive me and fight for what is right which is matagal ko na dapat gnawa or just leave, and start all over again sa bagong trabaho without looking back since nakipaghiwalay na ako at pumayag naman na sya? Natatakot akong saktan nya ako at huntingin nya ako, sakaling I chose the first option.  There were times na papakitaan nya ako ng pic ng baril, yayabangan ako na mga tito nya were either mga pulis, and some are NPA (naconfirm ko lahat to). I want to fight for myself pero natatakot ako..for reference, I have proofs, screenhots, and images of my bruises. I can also easily get cctv footages as i created a journal indicating the date and time whenever may pisikalang nagaganap.

Am I being abused and gaslit? What counts as abuse?,"Hello! I will go directly to the point. I am writing this because for the first time in a couple of years, my father hit me after we argued. Specifically he punched me in the head and face multiple times (he managed to punch me in the eye). My mother also slapped me multiple times after. My parents always go for the head or face. I am 21, and though this has been the first time it happened in a while (mostly because of physical distance), it is something that used to regularly happen to me since I was 12.

I've been grappling with depression and mental health issues from a young age and kept it to myself because my family had very vocally negative views on mental illness. This made me a very irritable and volatile child. To be clear though, it only manifested in me being angry all the time and quick to talk back at home, however I was well behaved, active and got good grades in school. I was never the type to act out physically, only with words. That has always been the main reason cited for me being hit. I acknowledge that I am someone who is very blunt with a very sharp tongue, even from a young age.

My father worked abroad for most of my life but whenever he came home we would fight and it would usually end in me being backhanded or punched and us not talking for months when he left a few days later. My mother and I would fight almost every other day and she was very fond of slapping and pulling hair, and even strangled me once. I have never fought back physically. I come from a family where violence as discipline is seen as the norm and even encouraged, so mostly my grandparents would just say I should be grateful I don't get hurt worse and that I am well provided for. My mother said earlier that it's better that she hurts me physically rather than cursing me out in Filipino, because at least ""hindi niya sinisira pagkatao ko"". Basically, I'm always told I brought this on to myself.

When I was younger, I thought this was normal and happened in every family. I said to myself that it's okay as long as they never left bruises. I feel like I'm the crazy one for resenting this treatment. In the few years since I last got hit, I've just been suppressing the memories and feelings of that time. However, being hit again as an adult, I'm starting to question if I really deserve to be hurt? Is this normal?",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/yotit0/am_i_being_abused_and_gaslit_what_counts_as_abuse/,t2_t2ccdxkk,2022-11-08 01:14:22,1,4

Hi everyone! I run a mental health page and I’m currently researching for a post I want to write up on Dealing with the Guilt of Cutting Off Abusive Family.

I’m looking for people of all ages who I can interview, preferably through video call, who have been through this experience.

I would love to understand this subject better as I know this is quite common in Filipino culture, especially with the whole concept of “Utang na loob”.  


Personally, I have dealt with an abusive family member and was able to cut them off while quite young, but I never really struggled with the feelings of guilt afterwards since we never had a good relationship to begin with. At most, I do know what it feels like to grieve a relationship you never had, but I would like to understand what it feels like to walk away from a parent you actually loved.

If interested, send me a message and let’s set up a call.

I feel like I’m gaslighting myself [ TW: Child Abuse ],"My mother knows I have depression. We went to three psychiatrists, all of whom said I have depression (I forgot which type— I forget a lot; this was in 2021?). She keeps invalidating me and saying I don’t have it because I’m “not taking any medicine”— I assumed it was the  filtered version of “why haven’t you died yet?”. I have a history of child abuse (abuse, generally. still hasn’t stopped) from both my parents.

I’m 99% sure I have BPD, but I have no means of getting professionally diagnosed. I could go to PGH, but I’m not sure if I want to take medicine; we’re really poor, my parents are abusive and I mostly rely on my scholarship to survive, and I’m scared of the withdrawals. Going into PGH also means that I’ll have to miss a class… idk what to do.

Lately I’ve been questioning if I have BPD, or if I have depression at all. I feel like she’s getting to my head. or maybe I am just too self-aware.

substance abuse,"*tw: suicidal ideation

Henlu! Just wanna share na lately, mas gusto ko na lang dumepende sa pagsa-substance abuse dahil hindi ko na talaga alam kung ano bang nangyayari sa akin. Oo, lumipas nga 'yung previous depressive ko—nakaligtas ako, pero what's the point? Talagang hindi ko na alam kung saan na ba patungo ang buhay ko. Nag-AWOL lang ako sa school at nakatambay sa bahay, umaasang babalik rin sa dati ang lahat. Gusto ko na lang mamatay para mawala na lahat ng sakit na nararamdaman ko—para hindi ko na masaksihan 'yung sarili kong nahihirapan.

Looking back, cough suppressant 'yung inabuso ko last time at nag-dissociate talaga ako. Masarap at nakita ko rin 'yung taong minahal ko kaya gusto kong ulit-ulitin. Also, I feel so light for 1 week after that dahil sa afterglow na dala nung drugs. And after that, balik nanaman sa dati. Bukod doon, nasubukan ko na rin mag-shrooms before before pa. Sa mga susunod, gusto ko ng kahit anong drugs—basta makakapagpalimot o manhid sa nararamdaman ko.

Diagnosed rin ako ng Bipolar 1 na naging 2 na lang lately. Taking mood stabilizers and antipsychotics rin.

May same situation ba sa akin?

I know maraming mas better na coping mechanism rito, pero sobrang hopeless n hopeless lang talaga ako sa buhay ko. Perhaps, 'di ko na rin naman alam kung tatagal pa ako dito, so why not 'di ba?

My (28 f) relationship with my mother is toxic and abusive.,"
So, this is the story of my relationship with my mother. A single child of a single parent. 

This post can be a little long, please bear with me to read through this. TIA!


My mother, who is a working professional, happens to have a toxic relationship with me. She, as a person, is wonderful, very loving, caring, a great mentor, but she hasn’t been a good mother to me. 

Somehow, life hasn’t been fair to her as well, so she inculcated this pattern of labelling every other person in her life as a cheat. Yea even me (deep-rooted generational traumas are real)

As an example, I’d quote one major, impactful incident of my life.

She has ruined my friendships since childhood, as she has been a teacher in the same school from where I passed out. According to her, no other person is good for me, and that she needs to protect me. Trust me, when I say this, I’m not bitching about her on this platform, but she literally has never allowed me to form friendships. I was brought up in such a manner that I used to share each and everything bout my friends with her, and with every friend of mine, she had problems, and brainwashed me to not keep friendships with them.

Somehow, i feel, whenever and wherever her involvement has come into play, my things have gotten bitter. I don’t know if I should be saying this, but this is the truth.

She blames me for every other thing in her life. 

There have been innumerable other incidents that have sharply tested my nerves, and made me lose control over myself. 

No one is born with anger, it’s inculcated in them. 

Having said that, me and my fiancé have tried talking to her, we have taken therapies, took her to therapies, but nothing seem to alter her behaviour. 
Also, that, even in her personal life, she tries to pick up fights with someone or the other. To sum it up, she’s very defensive.

This behaviour and upbringing of hers has generated a series of toxic patterns in me, on which I’m consciously and deliberately working, to break these.
 It’s like, I’m rewriting my own self, resetting all the current belief systems that have been an intricate part of my personality. 

It’s difficult. 

How do I be a better person and help her too? I’m really trying, but can’t figure out ways to help her.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/17wks1d/my_28_f_relationship_with_my_mother_is_toxic_and/,t2_cs9fuap7w,2023-11-16 19:35:39,0,1

All I do is absorb all those words, wala naman ako magagawa, I say to myself- at least he supports you, some kids get abandoned totally. Ang gastos kasi sa school ngayon kasi mag f2f classes na. I’m really down right now, this always happens dapat sanay na ako pero somehow mabigat pa din talaga words niya. 

I would really appreciate some advice and words of comfort. 😞",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/w9359e/abusive_father/,t2_mroi6cds,2022-07-27 10:56:25,13,3
how did you survive or how are you surviving from narcissistic abuse?,"hi everyone. i've recently been trying to heal and recover from narcissistic abuse. i think it's gonna be a long time before i can fully heal from it. i'm trying to take it slowly and i'm trying to not blame myself for the abuse that was done against me. i think i've been so gaslighted and emotionally manipulated that at times, i even ended up blaming myself.  


for anyone here who has experienced narcissistic abuse, i'm curious lang to know what were the things that helped you heal? how did you cope with it? i appreciate any advice that you can give and any experiences that you want to share.

"Hi!! I'm being abused at home, and I don't know what to do","Hi! I just turned 15 years old and may problems po ako regarding sa kasama ko po sa bahay, My parents ay hiwalay na po, My mom is abroad and my dad is far away from me working. I am at my Lola's house here kasama ko po ang Tita at Tito ko and their children. 

I need help because of my abusive guardians here, since I was a child they were already abusive pero when my mom went abroad to work that's were lumala po lahat. They were ordering me around an parang katulong lang po ako, They barely feed me, they have been verbally and physically assaulting me. Like every little thing I do jinujudge nila. It came to the point kanina lang na they were really shouting at me that they wanted to kill me and.. I got scared that's why I decided to find help online here on Reddit, since if sa twitter or facebook ako nagpost makikita nila. I thought of going to the police pero I don't have any proof na inaabuse nila ako since I always get scared whenever they get mad at me. Ano po pwede ko pong gawin? I feel like my mental health is deteriorating.

Medical certificate for my abusive mom?,"Baka vent na din to sorry 

I know na ang medical certificate is just for important reasons like work, school, sick leave etc. Pero is it okay to request something like that para meron na akong evidence from a doctor? Para naman mabago yung pag trato sakin ng mom ko?

Kasi I'm so tired of it like I tried to explain it for so many times at nakita na nga din yung initial diagnosis ko. Meron pa akong PWD ID. Hindi rin maintindihan na may trauma ako. Tapos hindi rin maintindihan yung mga iniinom ko na gamot. Like may malala siyang side effects ganun.

Well ang trato kasi ng mom ko sakin is nakakainis na talaga. Tuwing gigisingin ako, papaluin ako kasi ang hirap ko daw gisingin. Tapos hindi naniniwala sa mental health like patamad tamad lang daw ako. Tapos sabi niya pineperahan lang daw ako ng psychiatrist ko. Then sabi niya tigilan ko na daw yung mga gamot na yan kasi lagi daw ako inaantok and she also threatened me na di na daw ako bibigyan ng funds to buy a medicine ganyan. Kaya lumalakas ang panic attacks ko lately.

Kahapon nag bayad na ako ng 500 to request a medical certificate from my psychiatrist kaso ano lang siya sick leave lang siya. Kasi ayaw ko na munang mag bantay ng tindahan namin for a week kasi pamanalo lang ang pag gising sakin at wala akong day off para magpahinga ng buong araw.

Hindi pa naibibigay sakin yung medcert btw, pero is it okay to request a medical certificate related to my situation? Kung okay lang, ano ang sasabihin ko sa psychiatrist?

Please help me assess if my parent is abusive or im only thinking it,"May injury nanay ko sa left leg and arm nya since natapilok sya 2 days ago. Pwera pa nun may sprain sya 3 moe ago. Tinatry ko maging mas attentive and patient sa needs nya, syempre, injured e. Nakakadisappoint lang na ayaw nya magpaconsult. Puro self medicate. 

Niremind nya ko na may papagawa sya sakin kanina. Sabi ko sige, after dinner ha. Tapos mga 6pm, kung kelan gagawin ko na, nagparinig na naman sya. Sabi ko, ok, gagawin ko na. Pero gusto nya sabay kami magdinner. Niremind na naman nya ung papagawang nyang document. Nagsorry ako di ko nagawa agad at gagawin ko pagkakain, lalo na patapos nako. Naglitanya na sya sa sakripisyo nya sa buhay para mapalaki kami ng maayos, sakripisyo bilang solo mom (pero financially tumutulong dad ko nun kahit papano),  pagod sa trabaho nya, etc etc. Sana naman raw sa pagawa nya matensyunan ko agad. Nagsorry ulit ako. Sabi ko ito lang naman di ko nagawa, lahat ng iba nagagawa ko agad (everyday sya may pasuyo sa trabaho nya). Humirit sya na sana sa byahe natin sa bakasyon di na tayo magkaproblema.. Tong part na to, tinitiis ko nalang di sumagot. Eventually may sinasabi na naman sya sa pagawa nya tas napuno nako, sabi ko nagsorry nako ma, gagawin ko na ung pagawa mo pagkakain nga.. 

Tas ito na, nagalit sya. Bat raw ako sumasagot. Di na raw ako naawa na may injury sya. Binato nya sa floor ung remote control. Nagulat ako. Tas sabi nya, di ka titigil ha? Binato naman nya yung 10 pack ng suka na nakaplastic (pangchicharon). Sumapul sakin at damit ko, ang daming nagkalat sa floor. Sabi nya, pagdi mo nilinis yan, di ako sasama sa byahe natin. Sabi ko sorry, pero di ko lilinisin. Abusado naman kasi. Naiirita ko sa ganyang power tripping. Lumapit sya sakin, kinuha nya ung collar ng shirt ko tas niyuyugyog nya ko, pagtalikod ko ung fist nya nasa tapat ng mukha ko tas nagmotion sya ng light jab pero di ako tinamaan. Nagulat ako na ginawa nya yun kasi first time nyang magganun. Di na raw ako naawa sa kalagayan nya. Sabi ko hindi ko pala pwede defend sarili ko. Syempre, nagalit lalo. Kinuha nya ung baso na may tubig tapos tinapon nya sa floor. Sabi nya, linisin mo yan. Di ako umimik. 

Marami pa syang sinabi pagkatapos.. Pero bottomline pinagawa rin nya sakin ung document na pasuyo nya at pinaayos ung remote control ng tv na sinira nya. Nashock ako sobra na tinapunan nya ko ng suka at tubig sa floor, tas the fact na muntik nya nako physically saktan. Binugbog raw sya ng tatay ko dati at di ako makapaniwala na parang papunta na kami dun kung di pa sya nagpigil pa lalo. 

Nagkausap sila ng tita ko. Nagsusumbong about sakin. Naibato nya raw sakin ung suka, at hindi ko raw sya masamahan magpacheckup man lang..puro online lang raw. Eh ni isang online nga wala kasi ayaw nya?? Wala raw maitulong sa kanya dahil sya nagsaing at naglaba eh tinanong ko naman if need ko magsaing nng gabi, wag na raw. Sabi ko ok basta sabihan ako if may need sya. Manghuhula bako? Lahat nalang ba need ko ipredict mga kelangan nya? Pagod nako. 

Oa bako? Ako ba masama? Justified ba actions nya?

Toxic: Constructive criticism vs criticism? Judging? Gaslight? Shame? Verbal Abuse?,"Hello! Ito pong naging ka-MU ko na tinuring ko din na kaibigan ay naging toxic po sa kin. Ano yung appropriate na label po sa ganitong klaseng panghuhusga: 


1. ""Favor, paki-palitan mo nga yang profile pic mo, I hate it, baka makita ng mga kaibigan ko. Ayaw ko lang na pinagtatawanan yung tao.""
2. ""Gusto ko, kahit nasa bahay ka, naka-ayos ka"".
3. ""Bakit hindi ka confident sa sarili mo????""
4. ""Ang dami mong problema: financial ganito, family ganito. Ako, ikaw ang problema ko, pinag-aayos ka, ayaw mo naman""
5. Bibigyan niya ako ng silent treatment pag hindi ako nagpakita ng picture na naka-ayos ako ng damit. 
6. ""Gusto lang naman kita matutukan"" (means ma-monitor)

Note: Lahat nga lang po nito ay nasabi niya sa chat dahil nagka-lockdown. Nung dati in person, di niya masabi sa mukha ko itong mga to. 

Sinabi niya na aware siya na nakakasakit siya pero pinili  niya na makasakit para mag ""improve"" daw ako - para may ""impact"" daw sa kin. Nalito ako noon dahil naging kaibigan ko naman talaga siya kaya hindi ko malaman kung ano ang healthy o hindi sa sinasabi niya.

Dumating din yung point na nasa limit na ako at nagising na na tanggap ko na na one-sided lang na ako lang may feelings sa kanya so kinausap ko siya na titigil na ako at hayaan na ako mag move on.

How to deal with mentally abusive mother?,"Hi! 

So I came to an FB post about Mentaly Abuse Awarness week, where it states the red flags of a mental abuser. All checks on how my mom treats me, my husband, and dad. I was able to tolerate it for the past years but things got worse as I became aware of this abuse (still somehow tolerate it because she threatens me of self-harm -- not really suicide but more like ""maglalayas ako, hayaan nyo nalang ako mamatay, mawawalan na ako ng silbe sa mundo"" script). 

After a year of being married and now pregnant, my growing family is now my priority and I don't want to adapt that kind of mindset/attitude/personality. I want to continue my pregnancy in a healthy environment. 

Btw, we live with my parents currently. My husband's job is mostly site-based so he doesnt come home that often. But since the pandemic, he comes home more often and just wanted to be at peace when he's off. But my mother controls our decision in the house (which btw not ours, it was my lola's whom we took care of before passing away), eg. When are going out, where are we going, things we buy for ourselves, etc. -- reason nya is siya naman daw lahat gumagawa sa bahay. Gusto nya bayaran namin siya (consistently) pero kami na nga sa utilities, food and grocery and even car expenses na sila palagi gumagamit, ako pa nagpapaalam kapag gagamitin ko. 

I'm an only child, breadwinner since I graduated and landed a stable job (going 8 yrs!) Im actually exhausted to work, but I cant ""rest"" because my parents depends on me. They didnt have savings.

Its sad that she imposes that I should be happy with ONLY her, she gets irritated when Im with my husband or simply talking to him. Sabi nya, baka kapag nagka-apo siya magbago siya. But I dont see it that way. Baka pangunahan pa nya ako sa parenting style - which she took offense when I confronted her abt that I'm worried. All I was asking was for her to support me and my husbands decisions because we arent growing in this kind of setting. 

We plan of moving out, renting an apartment. Again with the threatening and all. She consistently shouts at my dad and blames him for the life they have right now -- which I dont see any wrong except wala silang naipundar. Wala naman kami problema to provide with them kaso we dont feel appreciated, ang hirap pakisamahan. Pero with the threatening, di ko na alam gagawin ko. 

My worry now is when we move out, baka mag-inarte and magsakit sakitan -- which she already did in the past. She cleaned the entire house and got an ankle fracture then blames me because I left her to spend the day with my bf (now husband) which we celebrated his birthday and planned out weeks before. 


Should I send her to a retreat? To reflect? I tried to ask her seek her from a psychologist, she denies she needed one. 

Im also a psych grad, then tells me ""psych ka dba? Dapat intindihin mo ako"" :(",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/mlv6zf/how_to_deal_with_mentally_abusive_mother/,t2_6b5einc2,2021-04-07 13:33:53,5,15
"Filed a complaint against my abuser (family member) to the barangay, any advice?","Hi reddit! As you saw from the title, I just filed a complaint against my abuser, a family member, to the barangay.

I’m not sure what I can and can’t post online about the full story as I definitely dont want to complicate my case. But I definitely have evidence against my abuser, and I explained the full story to the barangay representative. The brgy rep and the rest of my family was fully on board with the course of action we are taking.

I’m not sure if I can discuss what these actions are here, but we will be meeting with my abuser at the brgy hall next week. That’s if they show up, at least.

Tip: Never befriend and talk about your trauma to your abusers,"I was bullied by this one person for ten years. And I thought I could fix this trauma by befriending my abuser and talking about it  with him in chat, but it only left me with even more trauma in the end. 

Years ago I thought it was a good idea to befriend a bully because he was the only one I knew who would be willing to do crazy shit with me, even though he did a lot of bad things to me in the past, but I didn't care at the time because I was desperate, I thought we would create good memories together and override the trauma I had because of him but I really regret doing this. Because weeks later after that I got bullied by him again. This time even worse because instead of getting bullied in school, I was now being bullied in my own house. He would even bully my old parents. 

Now a few months ago I finally got the courage to talk about the things he did to me in the past. He did apologize to some of it but he also made up some bullshit excuses. And because of that I wasn't content so I kept nagging on him about it over and over again until he admits to be in the wrong, but I did it so much that he eventually got tired of me and went full on gaslighter mode and then blocked me on messenger recently. His last messages kinda hurts, not because it is true, it's because I didn't even get the chance to refute those claims he made about me. He just blocked me with no warning. 

Back then I could easily handle those painful memories done to me by that abuser, but now after befriending him and getting blocked, it's much harder deal with because it hurts even more than before now. Those memories got personal after befriending him because of the fact that he was only tolerating me, was only with me for what I have, and playing mind games the entire time with me, and then left me when I finally grew a spine and could no longer get what he wants from me. And I only realized this when it was too late.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/y2x36t/tip_never_befriend_and_talk_about_your_trauma_to/,t2_ecnncwsc,2022-10-13 20:10:44,13,2
[TW: Abuse] Any advice or resources/organizations for runaway teens? Advice regarding my living situation?,"Hi, you can check [my post history](https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/y4fbki/my_mother_is_a_severe_hoarder_and_her_cat_died_in/) for more details. Sorry for my broken english, I'm typing this in a rush before my aunt can read any of this from the family computer's monitor.

Basically I ran away from home because my mother is a severe hoarder and my father abandoned our family. My mother does not have a job and can't financially support me and herself. My mother would not let me take showers or take care of my hygiene, because of how dilapidated house is and the broken pipes, resulting in our house flooding if you turned on the water. She did not want to deal with that trouble, so I went weeks without bathing our brushing my teeth for the past 3 years. I can only take care of my hygiene if I go to my friends' houses and use their bathrooms.

Fortunately I have the privilege of going to the US next month to spend time with a family member there, but once I return to the Philippines in July, I will have no where to go.

My aunt and older cousin (Ate) could take me in. My psychiatrist recommended I do that, since my Ate is more responsible than my mother. However, because of how neglectful my mother is towards me, I have a lot of freedom to go out whenever I like and return home as late as I please. Living with my very controlling aunt, who will not even let my Ate step foot outside of the house if it's not for work.

I will be sacrificing my freedom for stability and the ability to care for my hygiene anytime, but I don't know if that is a sacrifice I am willing to make. My friends mean a lot to me, and because of how abusive my mother was when I was young, I am mentally stunted since I was a child. 

I never got to experience things other kids did, because she kept me locked up at our house and constantly yelled at me for being the reason of why my brothers and father abandoned us. As a result, I'd like to live my teenage years to the fullest and make memories with new things I get to experience because of my friends.

No other family or friends can take me in. I'm really scared for my safety and what this means to me if I pick either side. I don't know what to do and I don't know what the future holds, but neither do you guys. I don't expect a miracle. But please send any advice or input you guys can give on my situation.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/12qmgyb/tw_abuse_any_advice_or_resourcesorganizations_for/,t2_q7ifcohh,2023-04-18 21:05:56,2,1

I’m struggling with the memories of my sister forcefully abusing me as a kid and I don’t know how to heal…,"I’m 23 and Im having these reoccurring memories of my sister (four years older than me) trying to drown me, suffocate me and lots of unspoken things at the age of about me being 4-12 years old. She has this need for my attention and approval but I’m struggling with feeling I have no empathy for anything she goes through.  I think this may because of the horrific things I remember such as I remember her zip tying my fingers, making me drink soap or eat salt. She would take a pillow and put it over my face and sit on it until I was screaming bloody murder. We would fight like normal sisters ( I thought ) we would get into fist fights and she would pull my hair to it falling out. I remember almost drowning on several occasions. She would only let go because I clawed my way out of it everytime. One time me and my friend got tricked into getting locked out of my house for 30 min so her and her friends could enjoy there time without us kids but we were only wearing shorts tank tops and flip flops in the middle of winter with snow and ice on the ground. I remember her showing me porn all the time. There’s a lot of confusion I think it’s time to maybe see a therapist but I’m scared that will not go well. My parents were never around and would have my sister watch me (might be why she showed such force towards me). Till this day it haunts me and she’s very manipulative in a sense she records her self crying to send it to me so she can get every bit of sympathy out of me. I can’t take it anymore but I feel like the bad guy because I don’t feel bad for her. I feel bad in a sense she deals with depression and I understand that but I have this distance I keep from her. I understand she may have been a victim of other types of abuse as well and this may be why things were what they were.

She claims she doesn’t remember trying to drown me and moves on from the conversation fairly quick. These memories are becoming more vivid as I start to get older but I don’t know what to do with them I have a hard time with mental health and making any connections I haven’t made a friend in 7 years.

I find it hard to look for a good-paying job because of my depression, so I can't afford therapy yet. I also came from an abusive relationship that lasted for years, and her behavior reminds me of how my ex was like so I get very triggered easily.

I'm here to ask for suggestions or ideas from people who are already going to therapy on how I can avoid getting triggered by my mom every time she's being abusive. This happens every day and I know I can't do anything about her behavior. I want to heal, to function better, but I can't do it since I'm still here in her house and I'm not financially capable to move out yet. I'm not even mentally fit to work and I can say this because I tried applying for an internship to see if I'm capable enough to work and I failed miserably and was always absent because I was having depressive episodes that lead to s\*\*\*\*dal thoughts.

Please share some ideas on how I can handle this. Please, thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/rvx55w/can_someone_please_tell_me_how_i_can_stop_feeling/,t2_fupoc1de,2022-01-04 23:36:06,7,6

"should i go for therapist or psychiatrist? CPTSD, sexual trauma, living with csa perp and narcissistic mom + abusive household.","MIs: major depressive disorder, social anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, NSSI

Situation: Poor physical condition to leave the house. No funds. Controlling Mother.

Conditions: Consultations with doctor needs to be online.

therapy or psychiatrist? i have physical disabilities din (i am not sure if i can apply PWD). hopefully nothing over 1,000 PHP per session, please?

Context: My ex boyfriend gave me a lot of sexual trauma that has proven to be worse and more of a hurdle in my everyday life than my other MIs combined, even the CSA and Rape wasn't as bad as what he did to me. He's not necessarily a bad person, but I did suffer a lot and developed traumas I cannot get rid of, the nightmares are still there, there are physical activities I cannot do and even talking to people online is proving to be uncomfortable. I believe I have CPTSD.

Should I see a psychiatrist or a therapist? I want to heal.

"My mom's been verbally/emotionally abusing me and starting tomorrow, I'll stand up for what's right no matter what.","""*Lahat naman halos gusto ko ibigay s inyo kahit mga tamad kayo!""*

&#x200B;

For the past few years I've been staying with her, I have nothing but hope that we'll eventually be in good terms one day. I know that she's been trying to understand me and started acknowledging a few things I've done for her. I just don't think that it'll ever be enough. That in her eyes, I'm always going to be a failure and that I'll never be enough.

&#x200B;

Earlier today, we had a misunderstanding and just like she always does, she blamed it all to me. Ever had your parents get mad at you and then your other siblings will be involved na sa galit nila towards you? That's how my mom would do it. 

&#x200B;

This time, **I'll do whatever it takes to be heard**. I'll keep calling her out especially if she's saying something hurtful towards me (or my siblings for that matter). Even if it's going to cost my relationship with her. I'm going to start setting aside my emotions and handle them quietly on my own or with people who really cares about me. I've got this.

Abuse in home; looking for psych facilities for institutionalization,"Repost from yesterday’s NRD: 

Does anyone here have any psych facilities that they can recommend for institutionalization? I left our house again because my sister got violent again. But I know it’s also not her fault entirely, that it’s a product of a terrible home environment. All I know is I need to get her out of there soon and the legal route isn’t the way to go. 

Ideally somewhere that doesn’t cost a fortune yet can really take care of her, if there’s even such a place like that. She’s only 18 and very sheltered, didn’t even get to finish high school because her anxiety got too bad. I don’t think a faith-based approach is the best either. Most of the facilities I’ve found were like that. 

I have no extended family that can help with this, by the way. 

Follow up question: Where’s the best place online to scout for units for rent around QC? 

Though I’m terrified of living alone.  I’ve never done it before and I’m too emotionally fragile right now, with another breakdown in the making. But at the same time, I can’t be around people I’m not comfortable with exactly because of that. Not that I know anyone who can share a place with me right now anyway.

i’m thinking of getting therapy but feeling scared,"i realized na i think it’s better to go to a professional than keeping this all to myself. pero takot ako magsabi sa family ko. i’m still 16. hindi kami open. hindi uso ang communication sa pamilya namin. may time kasi na nagsabi ako ng nararamdaman ko sa mom ko, kaso she invalidated my feelings. sabi niya na drama lang to at itigil ko na raw ang mga iniisip kong ito. 

kaya siguro masasabing hindi ako okay kasi na-trauma na ako sa father kong alcoholic. pag narinig ko pa lang na padating na siya, nagnenerbyos na ako. nakikita ko pa lang na lasing siya, nagtatago ako dito sa room ko. i was always abused verbally, and he also abused my mom physically and emotionally, in front of me. that adds more to what i’m feeling right now. ito rin siguro cause ng anger issues ko.

Living with someone who has depression and alcoholic,"Hi. I am living with someone who is alcoholic and has depression. And it’s already taking a toll on me. I don’t know what to do. Feeling ko mababaliw na ko. I’m planning to seek a psychiatrist but I’m still saving up money for it. 

Growing up, I witnessed how my father abused alcohol and how he verbally abused my mom. I’m turning 25 this year and honestly I don’t have a memory of him na walang episode kapag nakakainom. So meaning, bata palang talaga ako nasanay na ko na ganun father ko. 

He was diagnosed with fatty liver last 2020 due to alcohol consumption and he was clinically diagnosed with depression last year. After he was diagnosed with fatty liver nung 2020, wala pang 6 months bumalik siya ulit sa pagiinom. Pa-red wine muna nung una then eventually bumalik na naman sa hard drinks like gsm, alfonso or soju. When he was diagnosed last year with depression naman, the doctor gave him antidepressants. He took that for a while, only less than 2 months. But while taking that, he did not stop drinking alcohol. We explained to him na masamang pnagsasabay ang alcohol and antidepressants. Pero ayaw nya maniwala. So pinapili namin sya, magpagamot or uminom ng alcohol. And he chose alcohol (: 

There’s a routine kapag nagrarant sya. Lahat ng nangyari sa kanya sinula nung nawalan sya ng trabaho, hndi na sya nagtry maghanap ulit. And up until now, he’s blaming it to my mom. My mom still accepted him. Loved him. Gave everything to him. Nakapagtapos kaming magkakapatid with the hardwork of my mom but kahit ganun father ko, we still treated him with respect. Never namin pnaramdam sa kanya na wala syang trabaho. Kasi okay lang naman eh, ang gusto namin maramdaman eh yung alaga nya. Yung pagiging tatay nya samin. But I guess he failed to do so. 

I think we already did everything we can. Yung ibang kapatid ko hndi na umaasang magbabago sya. He was surrounded by us— his family na binibigay lahat sa kanya pero ni minsan hndi nya naappreciate. Everytime na nakikita ko syang umiinom, natatakot na ko at hndi makatulog dahil alam ko na mangyayari. Ilang years na ko nagsusuffer from insomnia because of that. I’m thinking to move out pero iniisip ko ang mom ko pati yung youngest sister ko kung sino kikilos sa bahay pag wala nako. Cause my father stopped being a father for several years now. 

He’s not hurting us physically… But grabe verbally. Sana nga physically nalang. I think I’m emotionally abused. Don’t get me wrong— I love my father. I do love him so much na kahit ganito sya ayoko parin mawala siya sa mundong to. Nilalagay ko rin naman situation ko sa situation nya.

How do I tell my abusive single mother (who caused most of my trauma) that I need help/ want to start seeing a therapist?,"Hi.

Auditory hallucinations,"Hello it’s me again. So I recently started having auditory hallucinations last sunday. Pero I feel like I’m still me. Still funny and still always laughing like I am not abused as a kid. I used to be a psychiatric nurse before I went to med school kaya I am aware of what I am going through right now. It’s good that I am aware kaya I started treatment right away. I am taking a leave of absence from school because I am afraid to be a nuisance to others. I feel like baka when there’s too much auditory stimuli, baka I have a hard time differentiating what’s real vs not. The voices are louder than they were yesterday. It’s getting harder to sleep because the nightmares are more vivid than they used to be. I am mostly in my bed and whenever I try to study nahihirapan ako mag focus kasi ang daming pumapasok sa mind ko. I hope na parang dysmenorrhea lang ‘to na after few days mawawala so I can go back to studying. Pero tbh I am really scared na baka I just created my own world pero ang totoo matagal na kong walang sense of reality. I’m starting to question kung registered nurse ba talaga ako at kung scholar ba talaga o talaga bang nasa med school ako. Naiisip ko na rin was I really abused as a kid. Do I really have these people around me or they were never really there? Na baka kala ko I am doing a great job hiding my hallucinations since sunday pero ang totoo everyone knew that I am sick. I’m scared na everyone feels sorry for me o baka pabigat ako. I’ve always wanted to help kaya I wanted to become a nurse and a doctor. Ngayon hindi ko na talaga alam. Before I try to hide them pala ang gusto ko malaman how do you know what’s unreal? How do you recognize your hallucinations 🥺 These are all new to me kaya I’m doing my best to cope and to rise above my condition. Totoo bang reddit to or I’m just in my head rn 🥺 It’s so tiring.

Someone Important Just Entered Rehab,"Good morning guys. I just learned my SO just entered rehab yesterday and will be in for a one year program, with one-way (we can see them but they can't see us) visits available after three months in. A bit of backstory of my SO, they had a rough childhood as an abused kid for being half Chinese in a pure Chinese household and developed mental health issues early on in life. Said SO has been acting up even worse than before this year which led to their parents deciding on rehab.

For purposes of preventing getting doxxed, I will just say that the rehab center of my SO is a good one and nearly all of those admitted there entered the facility not on their own will. When the parents told me all of this, I just couldn't help but break down and I remember my last conversation and date just a few days after this.

For those in this sub that had someone enter rehab or you have entered rehab yourself, how was your experience? All I know is we won't be able to communicate anytime soon and they're in a better place where they're well taken cared of than being in public. Any tips for coping would also be greatly appreciated.

How do you not let your traumas in the past get to you?,"Is it really hard to runaway from all the traumas you experienced in life? I’m M (32) and I feel like everything I do, I feel like all my traumas are just behind me waiting for a perfect moment to eat me alive. 

As early as 5 years old, I’ve experienced physical abuse from my father (thank goodness he’s no longer part of our lives).

My mom had another lover in 2004 who did not physically abuse me but emotionally, he did. He would tell me nasty things and make me feel that I’m stupid all the time. And good thing they’re no longer together too. 

Years have passed and I got into a few relationships. And I always find myself being stuck with someone who’s abusive (physically and mentally). Somehow, I find it interesting because it’s familiar.

Is there a way to report a bad therapist?,"I was diagnosed with PTSD & DID last year due to years of emotional, verbal, physical and financial abuse from my family of origin (parents and older siblings) I'm basically the family scapegoat and finally cut contact early January 2022 and immediately sought therapy. My first therapist was awesome! Very professional, highly intelligent and compassionate. But I sadly had to stop seeing him because my husband and I moved to his hometown, from Visayas to Luzon.

I am currently looking around for a new therapist. One of my MIL's friends recommended someone and we went to see her.

From the moment I sat down and started answering her questions she did nothing but dismiss, invalidate, and even *defend* my abusers and their abuse! She downright told me it couldn't have been as bad I said it was and that I should just stop focusing on the past and forgive to move forward.

I politely told her that the word ""forgiveness"" and the whole religion christianity schtick was very trigerring for me as it was one of the ways my abusive family controlled and abused me.

And do you know what she did? She *KEPT* mentioning it and started sharing her own personal life and how she's a christian and the love of Jesus yadayadayada ~ she went on for quite a while, almost 30 minutes

I told her again and again that it was triggering for me and I was already crying and shaking and begging her to please stop talking about it.

And she gaslighted me and said that *I* was the one who brought it up in the first place (I didn't, she did and I only *asked* her to stop and she *doubled down* and kept talking) and that she was only sharing the word of God and said "" If you don't forgive your abusers, God wouldn't forgive you either. 

*DID YOU KNOW THAT??? DID YOU KNOW THAT IF YOU DON'T FORGIVE GOD WOULDN'T FORGIVE YOU EITHER?!?!""*

At that point I realised it was moot trying to talk sense to this person who kept violating a simple and clearly established boundary despite many attempts on my end to make her aware of it and her actually seeing me having a panic attack over what she was doing.

I walked out of that clinic bombed and it has triggered flare ups of my chronic illnesses that are also a result of the abuse I went through.

Is there anything I can do to report her to the proper authorities? Maybe file a complaint against the board?

I know it may not do much or amount to nothing in the end but it hurts to think that many people seeking help in perhaps their most vulnerable state would be subjected to what I went through. And I can't just leave it alone and do nothing.

Any help or advice is welcome!

Please be gentle I am still reeling from the experience

Drugs that require special yellow prescription,"Hi! Just want to share some info since ang dami kong nababasa na medyo misinformation here sa thread. 

There are some drugs po that requires the special yellow prescription and these are the medications under Schedule II, III, IV and V. The exemptions would be the oral forms of Schedule IV and V as stated in the list of controlled substances sa website ni DDB (Dangerous Drug Board)

So meaning, yung mga Alpraz, Clonaz, and etc, they can be written sa white triplicate prescription as long as complete details just like in the yellow prescription and the S2 License ni Doc. This is based on the Board Regulation No. 1 Series of 2014 of DDB. 

And yes, unfortunately, yellow prescription means it needs a physical prescription kay Dr. and based din sa recent na nilabas na policy, they will no longer be accepting e-prescriptions. 

If hindi restricted drug ang medicine na you are using like Quetiapine, Fluoxetine, and etc, these are normal na medicines na so kahit yung usual na prescription lang and even e-prescription. Sa restricted drugs lang sila mahigpit :) 

So ayun, i hope this gives light sa current issue and i hope for the recovery of all of us! Sending hugs 💕",https://i.redd.it/sf0w92xq5sgb1.jpg,t2_c7wgwytj,2023-08-08 08:23:20,32,12

Attempt,"Hello. I am currently in the ER due to another attempt. I just want to tell everyone na I am glad I am still alive. I know we have a lot of shortcomings in life, but we are all doing our best. I look forward to the time when we no longer have to struggle and to fight for our lives from our own hands. To my fellow abuse survivors, I wish we finally find our peace. I am really struggling to know myself outside my traumatic experiences. I felt like they’ve been a part of me already. Abuse really affects normalcy especially when they were inflicted by those people who were supposed to teach you right and wrong during your childhood. It’s really a long and difficult road especially when you really don’t have a choice, but to pass through it.

Idk if this is the right thing to do,"I'm (21F) honestly don't know what to with my life. I can't express my emotions to everyone especially sa bf ko, has su1cidal tendencies, and overthinks a lot. I think this may have started when I was just a child when I was physically abuse (hit, called names, manipulated) by my nanny. It has been 9 years since then but whenever my family recalls her, I feel this deep rage within me that boils out. My parents knew that I was abused but they didn't do a thing because they were always at work at that time and no one would take care of me. 

""Tiis lng jud ate"" That's what my mom used to say. 

Now look where it got me. I have trouble fitting in at school and college, always on edge whenever someone talks to me, I  hurt my bf and the list goes on and on. 

Sometimes, when I remember things that haunted me in the past, I forget the scenarios but the feeling is still there.

What is wrong with me ? TW,"TW : pedo, rape, abuse, sexual abuse.

Something is really wrong with me and I can’t talk about it to anyone, ´cause l am deeply ashamed. 

When I was a little girl, one of my family members raped me multiple times. Also, when i was 9-10yo, 5 boys of my class used to touch me and another girl. 

No need to say these things are very hard for a child to bear.

The thing is, now I’m 17. I used to follow an account on twitter that would share accounts to report because they would share or like p€do p0rn0graphy. So I went on an account to report it and I saw the videos that were shared by this account. Children getting s€xu@lly abused. And I felt excited and disgusted at the same time, discusted because how could someone do this to children, AND WHY WOULD THAT EXCITE ME ? So i closed the video, reported the account and then I cried because I was disgusted by myself.
Was I a pedophile even though children were not attractive to me, and though I’ve never even thought of « sleeping » with one ?

But then I saw a video on the internet of an adult woman getting r@p€d. It also made me horny. But also mad for what was happening to the woman in the video.

So now I think that r@p€ excites me. The idea of ME getting r@p€d makes me horny and i feel so ashamed to talk about it. 

Anyone tell me why am I like this ? What the hell is wrong with me ? 


I would never do such a thing to anyone but why is it attractive when it’s about ME getting raped ?",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/17zvf0d/what_is_wrong_with_me_tw/,t2_cg74mw7j5,2023-11-21 02:36:16,1,4
I think I'm a psychopath but not the serial killer type,"So I would like to ask the community if I am a psychopath or just a broken man trying my best to live with the trauma that was inflicted to me when I was young. 

About me: 

* Sexually abused when I was 4 and 6 years old and even when I was in college but I don't really feel anything about it. I do use it sometimes so people can relate to me. 
* Middle child, the only physically abused kid of the family who is hated by his dad because I was/am very brave and palaban. I've held a knife in front of my dad when I was 10 while shouting at him.
* Dad almost cut me off but I was able to look for ways, I was able to become independent at the age of 16, fully financially independent at the age of 20. 
* Started self harm (cutting) for coping and later on for pleasure and for more reasons. I look at twitter beans and styro as a past time or when I want to sleep. I'm not one of those emo asking for help and attention.
* Not suicidal but I've done some dangerous stuff just because I feel like being crazy. Not afraid to die as well not because I believe in after life but because I understand the science behind our existence in this world.
* I am very conscious about a lot of things especially on consequences that can benefit me. 
* Intelligent, I guess. Very rational.  Graduated in a prestigious Uni. I am very calculating. I am of course very skilled and have an awesome career. I've never felt insecure as well. I feel like I've always controlled how my brain works.
* Very unemotional -- or should I say controlled reactions. I am able to show emotions of course but I am so conscious on its purpose that I would always think that it's very manipulating.
* I have trouble understanding love and why a lot of people seem to die when they don't have that connection with other people. 
* I've killed animals -- cute ones, as a culling procedure. Never felt pity but the high that it gave me is scary good. Never killed human beings of course, it's against the law and it's very disadvantageous on my part and there is no purpose for doing it. Also, a big, social animal like us is very difficult to just make it disappear. Such a waste of time and resources.  
* I am very charismatic and I feel like the world is my theater and I am always acting. I have no trouble getting people to like me. The key is to fully separate your ego from the character you're playing. 

I am asking this because I am at my 30s and now realizing that I am very different from a lot of people I've met.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/12x6rp1/i_think_im_a_psychopath_but_not_the_serial_killer/,t2_9gwoyeo8w,2023-04-24 15:03:42,5,20

Met a horrible psychiatrist in QC,"I went to this psychiatrist to get medication for my ocd/anxiety. She kept insisting that I bring my mom so she could figure out my family’s medical history but I kept explaining that I’m an adult and we don’t have that sort of relationship, bringing my parent would only make me uncomfortable. But she insisted it was needed so I brought my mom for the next session. She asked about our medical records then proceeded to tell her about CONFIDENTIAL topics between her and I. She told my mom my s*icide attempt and sexual abuse, both of which I have never told anyone in my life. But there she was, sharing my story without my consent. Of course it broke my mom. My chest hurt so bad. I tried to explain that I felt really disregarded as a person, it was like my opinion didn’t matter and the doctor tried to argue that parents should know everything. Again, I am a young adult. This was my first time approaching health professionals. I respectfully explained how she did not have the right to do that, to which she responded ""edi humanap ka ng ibang doctor."" That made me cry harder, and then she turned to my mom and said ""di ko responsibilidad buhay mo[me], responsibilidad mo yan[my mom]."" and told us that I was ""mental.""

I can't open this up sa mga friends ko or my family since I feel pinalalaki ko na naman ang issue and trauma dumping na rin; busy na rin kami sa kanya kanyang buhay and dealing with our own issues.

When will this ever end?,"Recent events have made me revisit my childhood memories. And.. every time, I recover a memory.. I realize how bad it was. How no child deserves what I've gone thru. How I wouldnt do that to any child.


Heck, I didnt even realize how neglected and abused I was. I thought everything was normal. Til now, I pretend that everything is picture perfect. Na.. I grew up in a loving family. And that I support them as much as they support me. 


But no.. theres a reason why I'm this hyper independent. Why I moved out, isolated myself, and called it peace. Why I dont like relying on anyone. Why it took me a while to learn how to ask for help. Why its so difficult to love myself. Why its so easy to self-loathe. Why I found it difficult to forgive myself every time I make a mistake. Why I always blame myself for every. little. thing. Why it always felt like I'm always begging for love. And why I've always thought that life is a chore I dont wanna do.

a little vent (some inputs would be nice),"hello all, my name's Aea, and i am no stranger to the whole mental health ordeal. i was first diagnosed when i was 16, and i am now 25. i am currently suffering from schizoaffective disorder (bipolar type), cluster b personality disorder, severe PTSD, and ADHD. 

not to make it super long but the gist is--i am a mentally ill minimum wager. Ironically, i come from a relatively well-off family, graduated from the blue school (hello fellow SOH people), and is relatively comfortable. (For context to understand how evil my parents are: we own several properties all over manila and visayas, multiple cars, several club memberships, businesses etc....) Downside of course is--i have evil ,narcissistic, terrible, abusive parents (i am a victim of severe domestic abuse).

Thing is, i am a minimum wager because i do not have aspirations for a corporate life (fuck whatever they teach you in these schools...""you are trained to be managers"" my ass!) and ACTIVELY choose to work in an NGO. i am pretty much self-aware, have learned to cope despite SIGNIFICANTLY LACKING support from my parents (who are loaded with money but hates me too much!!!). I HAVE to go to PGH (i have a white card) for constant therapy and medications (my mom doesnt want to take me to a private health practitioner despite having new luxury bags every now and then 😜 she says it's too much of a burden but proceeds to treat her friends every week 😛). I make my mom buy my meds by guilt-tripping her evil ass and sometimes it works.

lately though, i ran into a problem and had to have my mom buy me a new phone. basically, she thinks  she's giving me too much already and so i haven't had my meds for almost 2/3 weeks now. 

you see, i can buy my own with my salary (which is roughly 12-13k per month LMAOOOOO) but that would mean leaving me NOTHING for savings while my EVIL ASS FUCKING MOM bathes herself in coaches, and kate spades, and hermes, travels almost every year to different countries but refuses to buy her child some medicines because she thinks that child should be ""self-sustaining"" (which i dont really care and plan to be because i do not give a fuck about life and that they owe me reparations for sexually (not gonna go into details) violating me when i was a child, severely physically abusing me, and making my life hell. 

anyway, i have been off setraline and lithium and i have been SOOOOOO TIRED AND SLEEPY AND CANNOT FUNCTION lately and this made me think that i kind of don't want to take meds anymore cause i dont want to live needing medicines (wtf ano yon kung di ako maggagamot mamatay ako).  i don't want to take medicines anymore! i have been drinking them for almost 10 years goddamn! i want a normal life! what do i do!",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/1biidl8/a_little_vent_some_inputs_would_be_nice/,t2_ulh2keq8a,2024-03-19 19:51:48,0,1

"My teacher found out about my sh, what can I do?","Hi, last week my friends found my vent account on social media, their first instinct was to talk to each other and exclude me from this conversation, they were very worried realizing that I had been doing sh since so long, and that my parents both mentally abused me on a daily basis and sometimes even physically abused me. 
They didn’t tell me that they found my account, I just got called upon from this really sweet teacher. Now, keep in mind that she had seen my scars maybe a month before that and asked me about it, when I lied and said that “it was my pets” she couldn’t really do anything then say that she was here for me if I needed to talk.
Last week she told me that she wanted to talk, turns out my friend had shown her my vent account and explained everything. 
I broke down and told her that I didn’t know what to do and didn’t have anyone to talk to at home, and that I knew that my parents also had it tough, I love them, even tho they’ve hurt me.
In the end I agreed to go se the school therapist, as long as she didn’t tell my parents that I had been there. Two days ago, one day after my first therapist session, my teacher informed me that she had talked to the principal and that they HAD to tell my parents about my sh, or else they would be 
“breaking the law” 
idk if this is true, but I was so worried, she got me a private meeting with principal. But the only thing he said was “I’m sorry, since you’re under 18 we have to”. 
What does he know? He’s a 50yr white old and rich man. 
I feel so betrayed rn, I know my friends didn’t mean for it to go this far, but I feel like they should’ve talked to me. My parents will kill me if they realize I’ve been doing sh. What do I do?

Edit: my dad got a call from school today, they said that he and mom had to go to this meeting on Monday after school. He thinks that I’m in big trouble, or that I’m skipping school.

Divorce in the Philippines," Hello! I am a university undergraduate from Singapore preparing for my final year thesis, a documentary about Divorce in the Philippines. Through our documentary, my group and I wish to raise greater awareness regarding the lack of freedom that Filipinos face in getting out of an hurtful and abusive marriage, something that is shocking to most people who are unaware of the fact that divorce is not allowed in the Philippines. 

I understand that the Divorce Bill has not yet been effectively legalised, and hence Filipinos are still unable to get a divorce from their partners, despite being in a hurtful, emotionally and physically abusive marriage that many pray to get out of. I am trying to find out more about the real current situation in the Philippines, particularly from Filipinos who are affected by the lack of actions they can take to get out of their marriage and protect their wellbeing. If you are willing to share about your story, or know someone who might be, please feel free to reach out to me by commenting on this post. I would love to have a conversation with you, and rest assured that everything discussed will be kept confidential! Thank you.

Nervous breakdown,"Advisory -domestic abuse /trauma and PTSD 

No one ever told me I was having a nervous breakdown, no one ever said marnie this is a nervous breakdown . It was only “after” it was classed as a nervous breakdown although a lot of digging ,mental health services , gp appts , and medication that it clicked what had happened to me .",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/194eidc/nervous_breakdown/,t2_ph4g1ywy9,2024-01-12 06:29:18,0,1
My weirdly unique coping mechanism,"Nung bata ako I experienced so many emotional, mental, physical, and s\*\*uall abuse. Dumating sa point na at very young age (edarang gr 2) was my first time attempting to unalive myself :) tandang tanda ko yun kasi alam ko kung san ko ginawa yun at kung pano :) . Nung bata rin ako, tuwing nalulugkot o umiiyak ako I force myself to laugh and or smile para malessen yung nararamdaman kong lunkot. Ngayon, di ko na kailangan iforce. It became My weirdly unique coping mechanism.
