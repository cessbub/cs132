Getting stalked for almost 5 years,"Ex can’t move on even after 5 years.

Ako yung isa sa mga tanga na pumasok sa isang relasyon kahit kitang-kita na ang red flags. I used to be a devout Christian at super conservative, and nasa listahan ko talaga na s** comes after marriage. 

Anak sya ng pastor na cheater din na may apat na anak sa iba, at sa kanya ko naexperience na na-tsatsansingan, hinahawakan mga parte ng katawan ko na dapat private. Tinolerate ko yun kasi yung type ko lang naman noon sa lalake eh musician at believer of Christ, and my teenager self could not believe na may iba pang tao na ganun.

Sinabi ko rin sa kanya na nirape ako ng papa ko at sinabi ko kung ano ang mga sinabi ng papa ko sakin habang nirirape ako. Yung ginawa nya is yung mga sinasabi ni papa inuulit-ulit nyang sinasabi sa akon kapag inaasar ako at tumatawa sya.

Alam din ng lahat na wala syang pasensya, pinuputol nya ang strings ng gitara at nagmumura sa altar kapag may nagkamali sa kanta.

Halos wala din syang goals sa buhay. Yes educated sya, graduated cumlaude because of my help. Nung sinabi ko sa kanya mga dreams ko sa buhay (go abroad, build a great home in the PH, have my own business, etc) sinabihan nya ako na mamuhay nalang ng simple at di sya magiging komportable if ever mas mataas ang sweldo ko kesa sa kanya. 

May offer sakin nun sa Japan at sinumpa nya ko na di daw ako matutuloy, at nung nag Covid tinawanan nya ako.

Kinontrol nya rin pananamit ko noon at sinasabi na bat ko daw gusto maging tulad ng ibang babae.

Nag joke din sya na dapat daw magmast*rbate muna sya bago pumunta ng trabaho para di sya ma attract sa students nya (elementary yun).

Ilang beses kami nagbreak at di nya yun siniseryoso at nag iinarte lang daw ako, so when I completely cut him off di sya makapaniwala at mag iinarte parin daw ako.

Nagsesend sya ng pics na kumakain sya ng junk food at softdrinks para daw lumala kondisyon nya (he is obese) at mamatay na.

After blocking him on everything, sinasabi nya sa lahat na kami parin tapos sinasabi nya sa mutual friends namin na iinvite ako sa mga party kung nasan sya kahit di ko kilala kung sino na yung may birthday or ano.

So he made up stories na I cheated on him on a Japanese guy.

Then I cheated on him daw with someone I met at my music school.

Then ginayuma ko lang daw sya (sino sya para gayumahin?)

Later on, I actually got an afam boyfriend (now husband), pinakarespectul, mabait, generous, matalinong tao na nakilala ko who believed in my dreams, at sinabi nyang ginagamit ko lang daw yung afam for money tapos after 6 months babalik daw ako sa kanya pag na collect ko na yung money.

He became an inside joke sa mga friends ko dahil sa mga pinagsasabi nya.

Pinopost nya parin old photos ko pero covered ang face ko with an emoji.

Every time after na mag post ako he posts a parody of it.

Recently a mutual friend sent me a screenshot of his new post na he dodged a bullet daw kasi flex ako nang flex ng buhay ko abroad. Inadmit nya rin na sina-stalk nya parin profile ko at nahihirapan daw syang iconvince sarili nya ma huwag gawin yun. Jusko po 4 or 5 years na, aanhin ko ang ganitong klaseng tao?",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1ba2009/getting_stalked_for_almost_5_years/,t2_jzvpdqqzw,2024-03-09 06:56:42,357,67
Lol my mala FBI-stalking/investigative skills saved me from falling for a poser Redditor ,"LAST HIRIT KASI ANG INIT

Sa mga super galit dyan - have you found your sense of belonging among the mob? Lol you’re welcome. Na fulfill belonging needs nyo today ☺️

—————————————-

Funny lang, I guess a lot of women can relate , idk if men are like this too pero usually women ang naririnig ko na ganito, yung bigyan mo lang ng kunting leads and maka-find talaga ng more information sa isang tao or kahit buong angkan/friends/baranggay pa nya HAHA. 

I won’t specificy nalang from which subreddit ko na meet yung guy. TBF, we did match each other’s energy nung nag usap kami. FF took the conversation off reddit na. The chats became frequent and medyo may attachment na BUT I have this gut feeling pa rin na he’s not who he says he is. 

Although hindi specific yung sinabi nya from where sya, halaaaaa from the tidbits of information na sinabi nya ie how long it would take him to come to the place we were supposed to meet (we had plans to meet), the activities he’s attending (what time he leaves for it kasi ganitong oras magstart), the backgrounds of the photos he sent me (wala sa reverse Google image search btw)….shoot I FOUND HIM. 

Nung una nahirapan ako magconfirm kasi 6-footer daw si kuya and I didn’t find anyone towering sa lead photos PERO PERO may isang tao talaga na hawig sa kanya huhu I tried to find a clearer photo of that person and nung kaya ma zoom in yung details…shet the light moles on his face, yung maliit na battle scars (pimples siguro when he was younger) ting dong ding 🛎️ CONFIRMED. CASE CLOSED. MEETING ADJOURNED. LOL

Grabe yun lang. I applauded myself talaga when I found, na halong tawa, na halong iyak :(

Edit: I don’t get mga “superficial” labels on me. I investigated cause I had a feeling na I’m being lied to. IDK what your basis is to your relationships including friendships but trust and honesty is very vital to me. Without those foundations, I don’t want anything with anyone. Who knows what else the person lied about or will lie about in the future 🚩🚩🚩

Edit: WAIT LANG HAHA di ko mareplyan lahat na nagsabi na nag-assume lng ako na di sya 6ft. So guys, the other things in the photos that have a standard or estimatable size. Ex. An iPhone. Yung phone na hawak nya, still depends kung anong model yun, may kunting margin of error BUT STILL you can still measure how many iPhones vertically he is!!! Kahit mag add/subtract pa ko dahil sa angle etc, ang layoooo pa rin sa 6ft.

—————————————————

FINAL EDIT

Nah I’m not surprised how the majority is out with their torches and pitchforks - Filipinos do have the mob mentality. 

And secondly, the crab mentality. The more I explain the method I used, the more may nagagalit, mukhang matatalino naman but sarado na isip nila kahit possible naman talaga yung ginawa ko. 

Thirdly, may mga lacking sa reading comprehension din hahahaha. Tips lang on the outline: 
- 1st paragraph is the INTRODUCTION 
- 2nd paragraph is the CONTEXT/ BACKGROUND 
- 3rd paragraph is the INVESTIGATION 
- 4th paragraph is the CONFIRMATION 
- 5th paragraph is my reaction

Fourthly, challenge ko lang sa inyo lahat, mamaya pagtingin nyo ng group photos ng mga tao, kung gaano ba kahirap ma notice na hindi 6-footer yung tao hahahaha yun lang ciao ✌️ ",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1c1yca9/lol_my_mala_fbistalkinginvestigative_skills_saved/,t2_xu3jkahq9,2024-04-12 10:53:13,1,178
"He said I was the best thing that happened in his life, but now I’m just a stranger stalking his profile","Ang bigat sa pakiramdam. Na itong taong to, for four years kasama ko sa bahay at kausap ko araw araw. I’ve touched every part of his body. I know everything about him, his quirks, his personality, his dreams. He used to tell me that I was the best thing that happened in his life and he can’t wait for us to get married and have beautiful babies. 

Minahal ko sya at ginawa ko lahat para sa kanya, alam nya yon. But now here I am, stalking his profile for the first time since we broke up last year. He is still with the girl na nalaman kong pinupuntahan na nya sa condo kahit kami pa. The girl na naging girlfriend nya just 1 month after we broke up. Ang dami nilang travels. Lahat ng lugar na pangarap nyang puntahan noon pero di namin magawa kase hindi pa kaya ng sweldo namin. 

I know that guy in the pictures all too well. I still remember how lovingly he looked at me when he told me that I was the best thing that happened in his life. But now one year later, I am just a stranger stalking his profile.  

Pano ba tayo humantong sa ganito.

I stalked my ex and regretted it.,"I saw him showering his new gf with gifts I asked him when we’re together. I saw him posting his new girl thanking him for all the gifts he gave her. There’s a heavy feeling about it. I’ve been contemplating if I’ll check his profile or not. But I did and I regret it.

I’m happy for him. But I somehow wish that he did that too when we’re together and I didn’t have to beg for it. But anyways, he cheated on me for her while we’re together anyways but just doesn’t want to admit it. He said it’s my fault that he had to hurt me and say all those awful things to me. He loves to shove it to my face how better she is and how much of a perfect boyfriend he is to her. 

But I am genuinely happy that I don’t have to live with all the manipulation and gaslighting from our relationship anymore.


Just one of my relapses I guess.

Edit: Yes, receiving gifts was my love language but di ko sinasabi sa ex ko kasi na fefeel bad ako pag makaka tanggap ako ng gifts kasi feeling ko utang na loob sya. And he knows that but tinatanggap ko mga gifts na binibigay nya coz ayaw ko ma feel bas sya and sabihin na di ko naaappreciate gift nya. But at the end of our relationship, sinumbat nya din sakin lahat ng nabigay nya and even asked me to return his gifts.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/15lz4z2/i_stalked_my_ex_and_regretted_it/,t2_a866hjhhq,2023-08-09 08:10:52,291,72
My ex-boyfriend’s girlfriend have been stalking me non-stop ,"It irks me seeing her viewing my stories and copying my post, stories on IG. Me and My ex-boyfriend broke up 5 years ago so I don’t know what’s bothering her. Plus, I am in a happy and healthy relationship too. She even followed me, liked my posts, even my older posts… 

How did I know that she’s the girlfriend? I viewed her account out of curiosity because she keeps on liking my posts/stories thats when I know.

Siguro gusto nya talaga mapansin ko sya kaya ginagawa nya yon? And para ipaalam sakin na she’s the girlfriend and they have a baby already. It’s making me cringe, honestly. She just gave birth and still have the audacity to stalk other people and copies everything about them. 


I mean, she should’ve mind her own business. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1bow9tb/my_exboyfriends_girlfriend_have_been_stalking_me/,t2_veuy5sdho,2024-03-27 15:43:25,58,42
I stalked my ex and guess what??,"I (30M) was dumped by my ex gf (23F) last January right before my birthday. (Worst birthday ever) Anyway, we were together for 6 months but I was really genuine with my feelings for her. She was pretty, sweet, bubbly and smart. I thought this was it. She had a few toxic relationships before me but we mananged to work it out until it didn't. 

She broke it off using the usual ""its not you it's me"" script. (I have reciepts if you want one). She said she loved me but she doesn't want to depend on someone else emotionally as of the moment. She wanted to stand on her own first. Said she wants to settle only once she's ready on all aspects. She even said she will get back to me and see if I'm still available by that time. I respected her. As a psych graduate, I understand that you really need to work on yourself first before being in a relationship. So, eventhough it hurt as hell, let her go. We had no contact by end of January.

Until now I am still affected. I fight the urge to message her and ask for her day because I know it will just being back all the emotions. I went to dating apps to distract me. I go on friendly dates but nothing serious came out of it. However, I still look at her IG from time to time. (I know 😮‍💨)

Tonight, I noticed one new featured story added. It was a video compilation of her 1st quarter of the year. There were a lot of the pics of her with someone. One pic was the girl carrying a boquet with the guy standing beside looking at her. This girl told me she's not yet ready and all but just after 3 months she's already with someone else? She never did that to me though when we were dating because she didnt want her parents to know she's already dating (strict parents daw). All it took was 3 months? maybe less. 

I honestly don't know what to think of this. I want to get angry, I wanna cry, I want to laugh at the absudity of it all. I'm not really questioning my self worth but I'm wondering was it ever real? All of the things she said, were they even true?? 

I'm even concerned for the guy. I know he will get hurt too. The things she did to me will happen to him too. It's not a great feeling. I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. 

It's almost 3 AM and I can't sleep. To all those reading please remember, just because someone hurt you doesn't give you the right to hurt others.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1btc6v3/i_stalked_my_ex_and_guess_what/,t2_x4063azaj,2024-04-02 02:56:10,15,32

Stalked my ex,"Normal lang siguro ung out of no where, pag sa madaling araw, nagising ka, di ka makatulog, then mag mumuni muni ka at maiisip mong silipin ung ex mo na sobra mong minahal dati, ung ex mo na nag pabago ng buhay mo and pananaw mo sa buhay.

I tried checking her sa FB and IG however naka blocked padin ako till now, it means di sya na curious man lang, but thats fine. Anyway, so I saw her tiktok, di pa kaso uso tiktok before nung nag break kami.

After seeing her tiktok, i found out na may happy family na siya. May new husband and baby na sila.

And this point while im scrolling to her tiktok, i saw vids of her and her baby. Then, i wondered, ung mga naging ko, may kanya kanya ng family or kasal na but eto ako ngayon, single.

I mean, di naman ako panget and all and i tried dating and nag kakaron naman ako ng mga gfs but at the end, ako padin ung nag kakaron ng problema. Ako ung reason ng break up. Sakin nag kakaron ng issue

Well, para sa mga ex ko, im happy that nakita nyo na ung makakasama nyo hanggang sa end game. Thankful ako dahil kahit papaano naging part ako ng buhay nyo? lol or maybe naniniwala kasi ako na every decision we make, leads to what we are right now. So kung nasan man sila ngayon, im part of it. Kumbaga I helped them someone kung nasan man sila ngayon.

My boyfriend keeps on stalking my batch mate’s socmed,"I have a boyfriend for more than a year. Hawak namin socmed ng isa’t isa. Siya naman nakaisip and nag-insist so g lang ako. Dati ko pa napansin na lagi siyang nagviview ng story ng isang batchmate ko and sometimes nakikita ko pa sa search history. Magkaiba kami ng province pero we did study in the same university. Magkaibang batch and department kami ng bf ko. Yung girl naman, from same batch and department kami. Di close nung girl and idk if they know each other. I asked him if magkakilala sila pero sabi niya hindi raw. Random friend lang daw and di niya maalala if paano sila naging friends sa fb. Finafollow niya rin yung girl sa ig before kahit hindi naman nakafollow back sakanya. Medyo inasar ko siya na kesyo di siya finollow back sa ig so inunfollow niya yung girl.

After months of not logging in to his ig, nagtry ulit ako maglogin kanina and nakita ko sa history yung account nung girl. Nakaprivate yung account nung girl so technically wala siyang napala. I tried logging in din sa fb niya and nakaview yung bf ko sa recent my day nung girl, which is selfie niya.

Gusto kong magtanong sa boyfriend ko pero alam kong magagalit lang siya. Pero I have a huge feeling na he has a crush on her. Am I overthinking? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1b8g87y/my_boyfriend_keeps_on_stalking_my_batch_mates/,t2_o8w453cq4,2024-03-07 08:28:32,9,6
What stalking gets you,"I feel sick. I can’t even finish my brunch, the first proper meal I’m going to eat in 4 days.

I just stalked his account (even though it’s not healthy for me) and found out he re-followed the girl he badmouthed and unfriended for me. I mean, expected na siguro yun—we’re no longer together and he knew her longer than he knew me. Ang off lang sa feeling because after basically calling her a “hoe” and reassuring me it was the right decision to cut ties, kakaibiganin niya ulit. He’s so full of shit. 

Although I long for him (I don’t like feeling like this but we dated for quite some time, it’s hard to forget him), I can’t deny the fact he’s a red flag beneath his nerdy exterior. I’m glad we’re over. I deserve so much better than his receding hairline and inflated ego despite looking like a fucking mole rat. I hate how I still get bullied for dating him. 

Anyways—don’t stalk your exes, guys.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/15f2ukf/what_stalking_gets_you/,t2_b2yg5o1sw,2023-08-01 13:08:38,13,8

Do men stalk socials too?,"It's usually the norm for the ladies to stalk someone's socials. That's kinda how they were labeled ""FBI's"". Naghahanap ng dahilan para umiyak sa madaling araw (lol), or sometimes to look for peace of mind. Gotta tell you, iba gut feeling ng mga babae talaga. It might sound ridiculous at first pero magugulat ka how they find out their partner's well kept secrets.

I'm curious though. Nangsstalk din ba mga men? Hindi casual stalk na checking recent posts, stories, and the obvious ones ha. FBI levels pinag uusapan.

Like iisa isahin nyo din ba ung following list nila, titignan nyo din ba yung liked tweets sa Twitter, kaya niyo bang ifigure out kung may ""link"" ba between her and the person she recently followed?

I still stalk them,"I’m fairly new to the dating scene. As an introverted guy who can be selfish and self-centered at times, I thought that longing for someone was not for me. But I was wrong, and started using dating apps. It ruined me tbh haha, dito ko nalaman na hindi ako kapili-pili, which sucks. 

Anyway, I met these 2 guys on the scene. Yung isa noong around June and Isa noong September. Both lasted for months, both ended up on meet-ups, both also ended up ghosting me. Walang label sa dalawang yan, but I definitely thought we had something special. June guy is already in a relationship and Sept guy seems to be living his best life. Paano ko nalaman? I still stalk them. I already cut them off, deleted our pictures and conversation. Pero may times na bigla akong na cucurios what’s new with their lives and kapag nalaman kong masaya sila, naiinis ako. I know what I’m doing is unhealthy, I try not to think or overthinking about it. Siguro, I just wanted to rant these things here. 

Nakakainis lang talaga, parang ako yung pinaka apektado in all of this. Promise, I don't feel anything romantic or good na to them, it's just that ang unfair lang how happy they are right now habang ako eto, still picking up the pieces of what ol dating did to me.

I stalked my Exes (ngayon lang uli),"Dahil bored ako and I felt a bit bitter for being still single this Feb... napag tripan ko na silipin mga social media ng exes ko.

Maganda naman wife nya pero nakuha talaga ni ex yung itsura nung bata eh. 
Nabulag talaga ako sa pag-ibig nung naging kami nito. 

TOTGA > may konting kirot sa puso. Masaya sya. Laki ng tinaba nya naging majimbo na sya lol. Obvious naman na alagang alaga sya ni wifey. Sincerely happy for them. 

First BF > napaka private ng socmed nya. Picture ng anak profile pic. In fairness, sya pinaka gwapo sa lahat ng ex ko at kita naman sa anak nya. Maganda talaga lahi nila. 
Yung dating bad boy nung high school na lagi sa guidance counselor at madaming bisyo, ngayon HS teacher na. Umayos naman ang buhay at mukhang nagsisimba na. 

Yung recent ex ko naningil sa akin > sad boy pa din. Buti na lang hindi ako sobrang nagpaka tanga dito sa taong to.

Stalked my ex’s FB and I felt happy,"Naalala ko siya bigla today and naiyak ako ulit dahil namiss ko siya. 6 months na kaming hiwalay (he broke up with me) at no contact na rin. Inistalk ko yung Facebook niya to see if he’s with someone else na. Wala naman akong nakitang bakas na may dinedate na siya ulit although alam ko naman na lowkey siyang tao.

Nagpalit na siya ng profile pic. His eyes seemed happy and he’s looking good which made me feel fine. I happened to scroll down more at nakita ko yung shared video niya na kinakantahan siya sa office noong birthday niya. He looked confused (parang di sure kung ano irereact) but I can see the happiness in his eyes. It made me feel happy seeing him like that. Gumaan yung puso ko.

I could have felt sad the fact na masaya siya kahit wala ako sa buhay niya pero otw na yata ako sa acceptance. Ang importante buhay siya (hindi na sana suicidal) at kung yung break up nga namin yung turning point sa buhay niya, sana mapunta siya sa tamang landas.

I’m hoping for his genuine happiness and peace of mind. Kahit hindi na ako yung dahilan at yung kasama niya at present.

Not that may tendency sya to self-harm. So far naman, normal reaction naman yung tweets nya. Syempre malungkot na galit na na nagsisi. Gusto ko lang ma-make sure na at least okay sya.

"Everytime I stalk my ex, my mood goes down.","Kakahiwalay lang namin this month, natapos kasi she couldn't see this continuing yung relationship namin. She found ""Icks"" in me, personal preferences na hindi naman red flag, something na she doesn't prefer in a personal partner.

Looking back, I was drained by her but ignored it since I love her. Na realized din niya na ginagawa niya akong backburner, she was so thoughtful na naisip niya pa yun. Pero yeah, I guess it's for us.

I promised her we would still maintain connection pero ewan, para saan pa nga ba. I'm not that type of person na would block my exes. We still follow each other pero naka mute na mga stories and posts niya sakin.

Pero nagiging habit ko na if sobrang saya ko, I'd stalk her para di naman laging masaya. Then bang, I found her chatting someone and asking na pili daw siya ng ipipick for Ig posts, something na she'd do to me back then.

if i feel i'm being followed i switch opposite directions just to see if a man will switch as well. sometimes they follow you parin, sometimes they drop the stalking. tho it still shocks me na some will be bold enough to let you know they're stalking you. 

nkakairita lang as a girl. paano na if you commute to and from work everyday the chances of the stalking will likely increase talaga. imagine how that affects u on a daily basis. don't u just wanna KAM minsan haha",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/17ei35t/why_do_men_stalk_girls_in_public/,t2_4zal0ope,2023-10-23 19:26:36,1,1
Last time I'll stalk him 😭,"I was going through the likes of his last post lang naman. Checking if I'll see a person na bago sa paningin ko. Ang lala ng paranoia ko para sa wala namang label lol. Then I was shocked that my phone lit up and a notification popped. Xxxxxx Xxxxxxx accepted your friend request. Paksheeeeeet. It was an office mate na naka like sa post nya. I must've sent a friend request by mistake. 😭😭😭😭😭

I don't know if the girl saw na mutual namin si guy. Huhu. Sana hindi kasi what if she asks him???? Sana bumukas na lang ang lupa at lamunin na lang ako. FML. 

This is one of the things na 5 years from now, I'd still cringe kapag naalala ko. I'm contemplating if I'll block her. I definitely deleted her as a friend. Bahala na lol.

Still being stalked after 2 years,I just want to get this off my chest. Sobrang epal ng jowa ng ex ko to the point na nagvview pa rin ng stories ko even after 2 years na kaming hiwalay ng ex ko at pinalitan niya ako kaagad. Very bad breakup kami at tinatakwil at sinusuka namin ang isat isa kaya gets na never na kami mag uusap tapos susulpot yung jowa nya sa ig ko. Ilang beses na to nangyayari.

"My BF's ex is stalking me, it's been a year already","A dummy account has been stalking me for months sa Public IG, just recently found out it's my BF's ex. He recognized it as his ex uses it to stalk somebody nung sila pa. At finollow nya pa main acct nya sa dummy na nakapublic din.

"Nag stalk si EX (first love) on my Instagram, 1 week before sila nag break nung recent BF niya.","For the very first time in a long time, almost 1 year na ang nakakalipas, nakita ko ulit yung dummy account na nagsstalk sa akin nung kakahiwalay lang namin noon (cut off ang connection).

Malakas ang hinala ko na siya yung nasa likod. 

Napapaisip ako sa mga possible na mangyari. Hindi ko alam kung bakit nag stalk. 

Siguro baka bumalik or na-miss ako (yabang lol).

Pero, para wala ng balikan na mangyari, nag story na ako ng babae kahit hindi ko girlfriend para lang makita ng pinsan niya (bff) at ng mutual friends namin.

Then after 20 minutes lang, nag view na yung pinsan niya :(( 

Tbh, after she ended our relationship, wala ng ibang babaeng sumunod. 

I just really hope na mahanap mo na yung makakasama mo for life.

Is it too bad ba na I keep stalking the girl he cheated on me with?,"I’m insecure talaga, tbh. I grew up being bullied kasi i’m a bit chubby na ever since baby pa ako and na instill na sa akin na I’m not attractive bc of that. Now, I have been with a couple of guys and girls (trying to see kasi where I would be comfy with) and some of them may cheating talaga involved but I really got stuck with this one ex. For context, I was in the healing stage when this guy I met sa dating app started na manligaw sa akin, he tried to win me for like 4 months and finally I said yes, so sa loob ng 4 months na yon kinuwento ko sa kanya ang lahat ng reasons ng failed RS ko and most them is cheating nga, so yun he promised na hindi nya raw gagawin and I shud just trust him. About 1 or 2 weeks after naging kami I saw a notif on his phone with his ex’s name, kinuha ko phone nya kesyo makiki log in ako, he tried to grab it back and kinda furious but I was able to open the chat and there, parang akong tinabunan ng lupa, yung feeling na ang sikip sikip tas di ka makahinga ng maayos. Matagal na pala sila magkausap, ang pinakamasakit sa nabasa ko was he tried to get back w/ her and to think sinagot ko na siya. Bumalik laha ng trauma ko, nasaktan ako ng sobra kasi I gave it all, I loved him with more than I could give, I did end the rs pero he asked for another chance and ofc tanga at marupok tayo edi pinagbigyan pero what stuck talaga sa akin is from that moment on, I keep visiting the girl’s socials, like every freaking second I am stalking her and idk, i think it fed my insecurity so much. Wala na kami ni guy for more than a year na but heto pa rin ako stuck sa pag sstalk sa ex nya. 

I know this is weird, idk if I need professional help kasi naging routine ko na eh, my day will not be completed if I won’t visit her social media accnts. Yun lang just want to get this off my chest hehe no judging please.

WHY DO I KEEP STALKING MY BF EX 🥹,Me and my ex we’ve been together for almost 7 years! and to tell you honestly there’s nothing any problem or trauma he has caused me. Pero alam niyo yun di mo parin mapigilan e stalk ex nya kahit antagal na non. Since HS sweetheart sila and all pero I can’t just stop stalking her. There’s this one scenario where I already unfollowed her to all socials since we’re friends on everything but after a couple of months akala ko okay na ko pero nakikita ko nanaman self ko na iniistalk sya. Pareho naman kami professional when it comes to our courses and everything. Maybe I’m just too much insecure? Idk.

I stalked my ex and..,"It didn’t hurt as much as it used to. But I was a bit of jealous of how he is treating his new girl. For context, my ex cheated on me with the new girl. And now, I see them on facebook being happy. My ex is doing things such as being more appreciative to his new girl when he didn’t do that to me.

I'm (21F) still stalking my ex (24M) even though I'm already in a relationship with someone else,"

I feel like it's wrong. I know it's wrong. Especially that my current boyfriend has been nothing but good to me. I feel guilty each time but I still can't help it. Whenever I go on facebook, after seeing all of my notifications, I always unconsciously click the search bar to type out his name. It's like my fingers have a mind of their own, I don't know. This is everyday, by the way. I want to know how his life's been going, who he's dating... heck, I even look at who reacts in all his posts. It's been a year since we broke up and I thought I had moved on from him. I've only been stalking him since three months ago. Ever since I found out from a common friend that there was rumor of him dating a new girl. 

I even convinced myself that maybe I was just curious. That by the time I'd see him post about the girl and learn what she looks like, I'll be over it. But then the day came that they started going public and all his posts were just about her. The girl was pretty, VERY PRETTY. Now my ex isn't entirely that good looking but he's a tall basketball player so that must have been a huge factor... But anyway, I never stopped stalking after that. 

Now he's not the only one I stalk, but his new girlfriend as well. It has already become a habit and I really feel awful.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/14qguok/im_21f_still_stalking_my_ex_24m_even_though_im/,t2_946zyxkj3,2023-07-04 22:33:19,0,6
"I created a dummy account in order to stalk my ex, ended up loving myself","I was at a period of time where I went through a really bad breakup. Both sides have their own faults. I was being extremely harsh at myself as well, owing up to my own shortcomings being the reason of it all. The other side's friends, of all people, are the ones telling me I should move on. That I should not come back. That it was my ex's fault talaga. My ex was toxic, but I didn't want to accept it.

But I was still clinging on. And I know that I shouldn't.

So what did I do? I made a dummy account. At first it was to extract information from my ex. Chat ko siya and be like yo anyare sa ex mo blah blah blah. I'm evil, I'm paranoid, and I'm just the type of person who doesn't want to be in the dark. My ex has a tendency to befriend anyone online. But then, an idea popped up. What if I chat myself and make my ex jealous by posting it online?
Genius! I thought to myself. Baka balikan pa ako. 
So I started chatting myself with the dummy account. I felt like I was the lowest of the low, chatting myself. It started out with introductions, you know, para realistic.

Then it developed.

From good mornings to good nights and then into good lucks. It felt... real? Even as I was orchestrating this whole thing, I felt better everyday that I chat myself. I didn't even screenshot nor posted any pictures online. It came to a point that what I was doing was not for revenge, but it was for my own self improvement.
I was cheering myself on, saying stuff like don't give up, keep moving forward. All under the guise of a dummy account.
I was severely depressed beforehand, but now I could look at tomorrow with a smile on my face. Opened my eyes that I deserve better.

Tama nga sila. Learn to love yourself first. Mahirap siyang lunukin. For me, it had to come from the illusion of an imaginary potential lover. It might be different for other people, and it's quite unorthodox yung ginawa ko. And I had really bad intentions at the start. But I wouldn't be in such a good place mentally and emotionally if it weren't for that.
Wala lang. I just wanted to share. Baka makatulong sa iba who might be going through the same things I went through haha

To anyone who's struggling, kaya mo yan. I believe in you.

"She stalked me and I got creeped out. We stopped talking, and then I miss her.","I need to harden up so this doesn't happen again.

I met a lovely woman sa isang dating app. I am the type of person that doesn't message first on 99% of my matches, but this time I messaged her on my admiration for her boots. We both own a pair of Dr. Martens boots. She said she bought hers on Europe. OFW kasi siya. I always looked up to OFWs. We moved to socmed by her request. She wanted to talk in Messenger, while I wanted to talk in IG. She gave her real account while I gave her a dummy account. Sobrang private ko lang talaga siguro.

We went back and forth and I found out that nakakagaan ng loob siya kausap. I decided to lower my guard and let her in sa walls ko, she did the same. I would always update her on my plans for the day and she would do that as well.

I've always looked forward chatting with her everytime I woke up in the morning. Nocturnal ako habang siya morning person. I changed my sleep sched. so we can talk more. I've been a nocturnal for years.

I attended an event, I informed her I won't be able to chat with her for a few days and she didn't mind. She didn't think any of it. Wala siyang ""tamang hinala"". I attended the event and messaged her after the event concluded. My preparation for the event, the actual event, and my pahinga took 5 days. I messaged her again and we continued talking like nothing happened.

She would always say that I look good. Walang araw niyang hindi nasabi 'yan. I would reply na sa photos lang 'yan, and not irl. She insisted. She also said na ang ganda ng boses ko, pang radyo daw. Habang ako delete ng delete ng mga audio recordings ko because I find them cringe. I rarely get compliments and hers really stuck.

I would always compliment her on being a traditional woman. She is someone who is saving up her virginity until marriage. That's something I truly admire. The mindset and traits she has might be rarer than actual diamonds nowadays. I made sure she knows that, I would reassure her everyday that she is special.

She knows my past. I know hers. Tinanggap niya ako kahit I had a lot of sexual partners in the past whie she never had any. She disliked talks about sex and I found that to be a breath of fresh air from the sexting and flirting that I used to do. 

I was surprised that women like her still existed, and I was even more surprised that she swiped right on me. She deleted and uninstalled her dating app account after talking with me. I just uninstalled.

One day, she told me na naaattach na daw siya. I had no reaction because wala naman talaga akong marereact. Blanko ako, if you get me. Looking back, she would always send her pics tapos wala talaga akong masabi. Minsan nababago ko pa topic kasi wala talaga akong masabi. As in wala talaga like, okay picture 'yun. Bumabawi naman ako sa appreciation ng ugali niya.

Dami ko nga nakwento sa kan'ya, kahit 'yung thought na gusto ko bumili ng Bajaj RE para maigala ko parents ko around their province. She liked the idea. Madami din naman siya nakwento, including her time sa ibang bansa, her impressions on foreigners ganun. Nakita ko din mga bike na binili niya for her father and brother, and mga motor nila. Everyday was a wholesome day chatting with her and I liked it.

Nafafall na daw siya, at this time I was starting to get attached as well. Hindi ko lang nasabi. I don't remember why hindi ko nasabi, maybe I wanted to keep it to myself muna? 

She was different from the majority of women na nakilala ko. She was truly non-sexual. If she feels horny daw, tinutulog daw niya or nililibang niya sarili niya. She is 26 at she still have the same mindset! I admired that on her talaga. Unlike most of my past encounters where they would get steamy sa chats and send thirst traps and provoking photos, she never did any of those. I've truly met a diamond, as if nanalo ako sa lotto.

She knows I have businesses but I never told her the names. I always kept it private. Gusto ko kasi bukod ang business life ko sa personal life. That being said, my social medias are private. I have a Facebook account na gamit ko bilang admin ng page and I use the account and page to advertise my businesses. That account used to have a lot of Facebook friends but my depression wanted me to delete my socmeds pero I did not. I instead removed everyone from my friends list and I joined Facebook groups instead. I would post there or I would post sa Marketplace. Ganun na lang point ng FB ko. That's the next best thing to deletion. I know some of you will relate.

At this point she never knew my real name. I never asked hers, she just gave me her first name. She didn't ask for my last name either.

Lagi niya ako inaaya magmeet and I would always decline. Hindi na kasi ako talkative in person and I was scared that I will look uninterested sa kan'ya pero ganun na talaga ako in person. I know she can tell base sa how I look on stolen photos, I never smiled and I would have an empty stare. Looking back, maybe I should've met her; so I can hug her and make her feel appreciated and loved.

Maybe she got curious or maybe she got bored. She decided to try and find my name on Facebook. My name is probably on the top 10 most common names and yet she found it! She sent me a screenshot of my profile but my dumbass brain and emotion thought it was so creepy that I was so turned off at the moment. I told her that I found that to be creepy and at the time I never really fully recovered from it. She regretted doing that and she said her goodbyes.

I miss the person.

I like Reddit kasi nailalabas ko 'to. Even my closest friends doesn't know about this. I am the type of person that likes to keep everything a secret; dito ko lang nailalabas kasi I am anon here.

I pray for her success in life. I pray that she finds someone who appreciates her and will never take advantage of her. I wish her the best.

Edit: I forgot to mention that after that incident I deactivated my Facebook and temporarily unpublished my page. Tambay-tambay na lang muna dito sa bahay mag-isa, plinking with my airsoft g-ns 🥲. Attend ako ng Angkas free training bukas! I have a week of spare time so try ko pumasok ng Angkas, I have all the reqs.

Told a guy thet his gf is cheating just to mess with him. Turns out na totoo pala.,"May naka argue akong guy sa isang post sa fb.  We argued back and forth and when he can't refute my argument he started attacking me with ad hominem rebuttals. I stalked him and it just so happened na nakatira sya sa same city as to where I live and so is his gf.  I stalked his gf and we have 2 mutual friends so I hatched a plan to poison his mind at gawin syang praning. I sent him a screenshot of his gf's acc along with censored 2 mutuals telling him na I know his gf(lie obviously)but they both didn't know me. Along with a message na ""kaya ka niloloko ng jowa mo kase ang hina ng utak mo"". Di na sya nag reply sakin after I told him that. Half a week later I got curious and proceeded to stalk him again. Dun ko na nakita yung mga sadboy posts nya along with screenshots ng convo ng gf(ex) nya at nung affair partner ni girl. Apparently its been going on for 7-8 months and he doesn't have any idea😭.

I always stalk the exes/previous flings of my Boyfriend on their SocMed accounts to the point that it has become an obsession.,"I developed my stalking skills from my previous relationship.
My ex had a gf and they lasted for 7 yrs. and since that's a first for me at that time, I got insecure and curious for the first time about his ex. I started stalking her fb almost everyday. I also discovered that they had a shared fb account. I tried to guess the username and the password, and to my surprise I was able to open that fb account although there's not much in there. I continuously did this for years and couldn't stop myself from stalking and also started this unhealthy habit of comparing myself to her and even showing her account and pics to my friends and colleagues so I can gossip about her. I even asked my friends to follow her private ig account so I can stalk her. I was also sub consciously copying her. From her style, her shoes, bag, hair, clothes, hobbies, interests, and even the events and places that she has been to or frequenting. I had this eagerness and competitiveness in me to be like her or even more than her, to surpass her.

Fast forward now, even though I have a new Boyfriend I still keep on doing the same thing to his exes and even previous flings. Now it's not just on fb, but even in ig, and tiktok. I was able to search their usernames and checks their account everyday. It's like, checking has been a part of my routine already. I even created a dummy acc dedicated to stalking and now I even added their colleagues as well. I couldn't help myself and always check their accounts. I just found myself copying their clothing style, and interests again. It’s like a cycle, an unhealthy habit, an obsession that I couldn’t stop. It’s like Cady’s obsession with Regina George!",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/164k9l8/i_always_stalk_the_exesprevious_flings_of_my/,t2_ewtqrohb,2023-08-29 22:39:18,7,5

my girlfriend greeted her ex thru ig notes,"Akala ng gf ko na hindi ko alam bday ng ex niya (i knew her ex's bday dahil nag stalk ako). Nag open lang ako ng IG to reply some messages tapos nakita ko she wrote sa IG notes niya ""Happy birthday. I hope you're well. :)"" 

Hindi ko alam kung anong ma fi-feel ko. Matagal na silang hiwalay and I think it's been 2 years already since they broke up. I don't think na naka move on na siya. She accused and kept questioning me before na hindi pa raw ako nakaka move on sa ex ko when in fact naka move on na ako tapos eto pa siya lowkey greeting her ex.

I even saw their pictures together sa phone niya and hindi ko lang pinansin. Ignorance is a bliss nga daw they said. FFS. Di pa deleted pics nila together??? 

I look stupid here. I will probably end things with her since I'm not at peace anymore. I've endured enough.

Wtf. I'm angry and sad. Please lang if hindi naman pala naka move on or hung up pa sa ex mo sana hindi mo na lang ako inentertain or bumalik ka na lang sa ex mo.

I'm ugly but I have a stalker 😭,"
I feel like I'm being stalked, even though I may not be conventionally attractive. Okay, maybe not 'ugly,' but I'm not exactly pretty either. I'm mid, kinda fat and just plain and boring. My brother's friend is stalking me 🥲and at first, I don't really care  thinking it was a prank. But it won't stop; my clothes are missing, and he sends pictures of them at his place. With my low self-esteem, I can't believe I'm being stalked. Like I can't accept he stalks someone like me. Okay I know attractiveness isn't a factor, but why me? I'm not pretty, rich, or interesting.

I don't know how to react at this point. I've told him to stop multiple times but he won't stop. Sometimes he stops. Sometimes he hangs out with my brother, and I can tell he's taking pictures of me. I overthink a lot thinking he wants to harm me. The point is I don't feel safe. He acts like a normal, funny friend around my brother, but online or when he's looking at me, his personality changes. I need help telling my parents, especially my brother, without them laughing at me or thinking I'm delusional. They might find it hard to believe that his friend, who seems okay and kinda hot (according to them) would stalk or bully me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/17yuqsi/im_ugly_but_i_have_a_stalker/,t2_mnetyibe4,2023-11-19 18:58:53,102,23

My (26F) bf (27M) wants to fly out of the country to spend time with a female friend :),"Throwaway account, but I just need to vent.

I was caught off guard after my bf told me that he just booked a flight to visit his FEMALE friend in New Zealand for 2 weeks. He plans to stay at her apartment during those 2 weeks also. Keep in mind, i have never heard of this woman. Una sabi lang niya he will visit and stay with “a friend” but after stalking on socmed I found out female friend pala.

I know that they talk every now and then (i see the notifs when we’re beside each other), yet he has never bothered to mention her. I confronted him about how betrayed i felt. Sabi niya 5 years na daw sila di nagkikita kesyo gusto din daw niya makita New Zealand, ngayon lang nagamit work leave niya. I’ve made my feelings to him about this clear: this is inappropriate, i’m uncomfortable, and i feel blatantly disrespected. He hasn’t made a decision yet.

My bf has been really great to me so far. But this thing is seriously making me question his morals and values. It’s messing with my head.

I’m venting here because I already know what my friends will say about this 🥲 napakabullsh*t ng situation na ito ginagawa akong tanga 🙃

I made out and had sex with a guy na may gf,"I feel bad for ate girl. Today, I discovered na yung guy na dinedate ko, nagkikita pa pala sila ng “ex” niya and two days ago, nagdate sila. Pinost ni girl and ang saya saya nila. Kung gano kami kasaya pag magkasama din kami or date kami, ganon din. Ang sakit. Wala akong alam na okay pala sila until nagstalk ako kasi he posted a story na nagbook sila ng ticket to Singapore this Nov. Kasama daw workmates but kasama din si ex pero yung binook na nakita ko for 2 lang. So from that sabi ko stop na to tutal di ko na kaya mabaliw one more time. Di ko na kaya magoverthink.

Upon stalking nung gabi, nakita ko they spent his birthday together two days ago. Wala hehehe. Sirang sira na naman ako. :(( Parati nalang ako nasasaktan ng mga taong wala akong gusto gawin kundi pasayahin, alagaan and mahalin.

I have a friend who strangely enjoys being a kabit,"

Hi, i have a close friend (F24) who enjoys getting the attention from men specifically commited ones.  

I would admit she’s pretty and have big sex appeal since pang attract nya talaga is the face card and she also have bigger boobs. 

Pareho kaming alam ang kati ng isa’t but we also have our own limits. She’s telling me everything na nakakafling nya sa bumble, office, bar, everywhere but good thing is di umaabot na nakikipag sex siya sa lahat ng nakakafling nya. 

She just literally like the attention. 

However, parang sumusobra na since there are 3 committed guys ang ineentertain nya 

- 2 guys have gfs, other guy is married. 

I asked her for fun, sino ba pinaka bet nya? - she answered yung “married guy”  well he’s quite the type, tall, gwapo, mukhang masarap kaso may asawa nga lol.

I really dont wanna meddle with her personal affairs since we’re both adults and we know the consequences. Unfortunately, nalaman ko nakipag sex na pala siya and few days after nahuli ni wife and now the wife was messaging her. 


Weird coz she doesn’t seem affected. Parang mema kwento lang. She quite enjoys it. Or siguro tinatago nya lang sakin? Idk. But I cannot see it. I told her, before it gets worsen, tigilan nya na. Di rin naman ako malinis like I’ve done mistakes too but yoko na din mapunta sa situation na yon. 

She told me titigilan nya but she keeps stalking the guy.  

I dont know what to do, feeling ko one day masasabunutan nalang yan bigla. Haha. But I’m a friend.

I’m concerned about her but I also think that she needs help. 

Edit: I didn’t post this to slutshame my friend. Siguro I just need more understanding about this kind of behavior. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1btkwr1/i_have_a_friend_who_strangely_enjoys_being_a_kabit/,t2_plc95eurk,2024-04-02 08:33:04,163,121
Bakit ang tatapang ng mga kabit?,"My boyfriend of 8 years (now ex) cheated on me.

I just recently found out that the kabit (security guard) posted on tiktok 3 months ago, pictures of them ng ex (engineer) ko while during that time, kami pa ng ex ko. She placed a caption ""friend ❤️"", while holding his hand, being intimate on the beach at sa mga inuman nila. When I found out about the affair, she told me na hindi siya natatakot na mapahiya sa workplace nila kasi alam daw ng lahat ng workmates nila ang relationship nila ng ex ko. Gusto pa nya harapin ko siya para mag usap kami. Sabi pa nya, yung ex ko daw una nag approach sa kanya at nadamay lang daw siya.

She was called out by my friends, family at family ng ex ko but what she did was she changed her profile pic sa socmed and showed to us that they are now living together with my ex, showing her hickey sa cleavage nya. She kept sharing patama posts towards me sa socmed.  She told me ang sarap daw ng t\*te ng ex ko at ikakasal na daw sila. Alam nya na ayaw ng fam ng ex ko sa kanya. Sabi pa ng mom ng ex ko, kapag makikita nya ang babae, sasabunotan nya ang babae. That girl didn't even show the slightest respect to my ex's family. What's worse, tinolerate ng nanay ng babae ang cheating. The nanay messaged na hinay hinay lang daw sa bunganga ko, kasi kahit ganyan ang anak nya, wala daw silang inaapakan na tao. Wow! Well, deserve naman talaga ng anak nya lahat ng masasakit na salita after disrespecting me and everyone else.

Nakakasuka isipin na may mga ganitong tao sa mundo. She's so proud na she started as a sidechick at ngayon, official na sila ng ex ko. Proud homewrecker. She's tagging me sa socmed na ex nalang daw ako, making fun of my mental health condition and kinalimutan na daw nila ako (lol while stalking me everday). Can't wait talaga how the universe will fuck them up after what they did to me.

BF has been following a lot of girls on Instagram,"Just found out earlier that my BF has been following a lot of girls in instagram. I'm not the kind of girl na nangingialam sa social media nya because I value his privacy. I noticed na dumadami ang followings nya and my curiosity got the better of me so I used a third party app to check who he recently followed and I was so disappointed that he followed a lot of girls. I hope this will not lead to microcheating.

I don't really mind if he followed insta models, what made me upset was when he followed normal girls na with in our area lang. I can't open this up to him since this is considered stalking.

This hurt me a lot and he's giving me reasons to overthink na siguro may ibang ka chat na ito. I really hope he's not messaging those girls he followed on his insta. I trust him, I really do. I hope he will not break my trust because I don't tolerate cheaters.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1791gp8/bf_has_been_following_a_lot_of_girls_on_instagram/,t2_kk3vfs55s,2023-10-16 16:50:43,115,75

DFA data encoder added me on FB,"Had my appointment the other day. The encoder was really friendly and accommodated my request to retake my photo since I wasn't happy with my RBF but anyway hours after the appointment I receive a friend request with about 30 mutual friends, all from high school. The profile is locked so I couldn't really stalk. My sister searched the name though and the results showed posts with location at the DFA satellite office in our city.

A few days later, I was having dinner with my friends when I saw said data encoder. I told my friend he looked familiar (since I stalked his tagged posts) and I made the connection so I showed her the friend request. My very quick friend clicked accept (boundaries, I know, but all in good fun; I laughed along with my other friends).

But minutes after that happened, he chatted Hi :). Under other circumstances, I would've engaged (jowang-jowa na rin ako). But considering he got my info from my passport application, which was his job to treat in confidence, I find it iffy to reply to his chat. It's not that severe but I feel like some of my data privacy had been breached. 

I'm due to collect my passport in a few days. I'm not sure what I'd do if I run into him. But also, should I reply?",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/zjhisi/dfa_data_encoder_added_me_on_fb/,t2_swy9ugf6,2022-12-12 09:08:32,96,57
My Ex Girlfriend is a fucking menace,"Ok, no one remembers this but I did post about breaking up for the 3rd time with the same girl last month and just left it that. But like..even when I'm actively not trying to talk to her anymore, she still manages to say dumb shit behind my back?

Like just earlier, my cousin(whom I told about breaking up last month) informed me that her IG story had her meet up(romantically) with some guy, and after she saw my ex's story she made another story about how someone is stalking her on my behalf and ""knew"" it was cousin, and even said na sana ayos pa sila kung hindi daw dahil ni pinsan. You know, if my ex said that last part because she and my cousin argued at some point, I would have believed it and understood her reaction, but apparently no. She just started yapping because my cousin saw her IG story and basically assumed because I told her na i stalk sya💀

Kayo ayon, napaparanoid nanaman si tanga. This is not the first time something like this happened because I specifically remember around the time we got back together the first time around that she was extremely paranoid that my previous ex and her 1 cousin and friend who was part of her friend group might have been stalking her because her FB story showed a bunch of non-friends(basically anon pag ganon) viewing it. Even though basically the same shit happens to mine all the time, and I really don't have any stalkers.

And for reference, sinabi nya din sakin na sa ngayon di na nya kaya makipag relationship, at kahit ilang months kaya nya di maghanap. Pero putangina, makikita kita ko sa messenger thoughts nya at pati na din sa status ng fucking Genshin Impact nung Holy Week na meron nakalagay na ""I love Luci""(yun tawag nya eh). IT HASN'T EVEN BEEN A FUCKING MONTH AT NAKIKIPAGLANDIAN NA SYA, AT NAGKA AUDACITY PA SYA NA I ACCUSE AKO AT PINSAN KO NG MASAMA, EH SYA NAMAN DYAN DAMI KAGAGUHAN NA GINAWA

Why do I turn into an ugly person when I fall in love with someone?,"I feel like nababaliw na talaga ako. I love someone for almost a year now. I already confessed but he turned me down because all he wanted was to be friends and to only have fun. A part of me wants to stop what we have but I chose to stay kasi siya lang yung safe space ko plus I love him. 
I can't deny na he's helped me a lot especially when I have mental breakdowns and relapses a lot. Pero I also feel na parang I'm turning into someone that I don't like. I find myself spending so much time stalking this guy. Because I knew he had something with someone, I even stalked his friends trying to know who that is. I know it sounds so crazy but I couldn't control myself and the urge to know everything since he's far from me. But he did say it's alright for me to stalk him. Still, I don't like this version of me.
I also compare myself with the girls that I knew he had a thing with before. Sometimes I would try and copy stuff like their hobbies or what they wear.
Most of the time I'd have trouble sleeping because I'm thinking of him. His absence makes me so so sad and I have to sleep almost all the time with a heavy heart and an overthinking mind. Only when I am with him can I ease these tho not until he would talk about his flings, exes, and even female friends.
I hated who I am right now. I feel so ugly and I just wanna puke. But it's so hard cutting stuff with him. 
I try to fill myself with other things. Trying other hobbies or ibaon ang sarili ko sa mga lsro Pero at the end of the day siya parin Nasa isip ko. 
I don't want to be this obsessed and toxic but I am one and I hate it.

He kept nagging about me stalking, i dont trust him, and that i was laughing at him so he mocked my laughter. He played defensive, so it goes to show he was really playing me. He manipulated me into thinking i was in the wrong.

"today, I accidentally logged off his account.","To preface, throwaway account because I'd hate it if anyone realized it's me. I'm a girl. And I've been obsessively insecure of my bf's ex for 5 years.

He told me stories about her. She has the life I wanted. And even if she's already my bf's ex, I always ended up being compared to her. His family likes her and stays friends with her. She's friends with his sisters and his cousins, He compared me to her while making love, how she moves better than I do. I'm not the most sociable person, but I do try my best. And despite everything, it wasn't enough. 

I became obsessed with her because half of me wants to be her, and half of me wants to see her fail. But I don't have the guts to do that. I stalked her using my bf's account because they stayed friends on Facebook. 

My bf learned about my stalking and unfriended his ex on Facebook. He got mad at me because I resorted to such behavior, but he also said sorry that he made me feel that way. He's been a good person to me ever since. 

But my obsession did not stop there. 

Until one day, 2 years ago, I tried brute force hacking her bf's account. And I got in. I was shaking. I didn't know how but I got in one of the closest accounts to her. 

I have a spare phone where I kept her bf's account and I have been stalking her every chance I get. Reading through their messages, looking through their photos, watching. 

For a while my obsession was satisfied. I knew what she was doing through this account. They changed their password a few times but never sent it through the messages. But they never logged off the accounts from where it was logged in. So it stayed logged in on my phone. I can't log it out after that tho. I tried stopping sometimes. Tried not to look at the account and stop myself from wanting to know what's going on with her life. But I can't. My mind doesn't want to stop trying to know stuff about her. 

Then today, after 2 years, I accidentally logged his account off. 

I've been thinking, I guess it's for the better. Losing a way to know what she's doing might just make me stop my obsession with her. Maybe this time I can finally stop myself. 

I don't know what I will do now I guess? I think I'm experiencing some kind of withdrawal. 

I should really seek a therapist.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/12vi9qr/today_i_accidentally_logged_off_his_account/,t2_9s9vf8h8g,2023-04-23 04:31:13,1,41
How I found out my ex cheated on me,"Let me tell you a story of how I caught my ex cheating on me.

I had my suspicions na kasi bigla na nya pinagdadamot yung phone nya and also pinapatay yun nun pag magkasama kami but I brushed it off.

So one day, he's taking a bath, I checked his phone and saw all his emails and he has a new email with his nickname and I also saw an app called ""Calamansi"" it's like a dj thing app or podcast. So I thought it's a game and didn't mind it.

And then night came, he left na kasi he has plans daw kasi for school. Since I can't sleep, i tried using my old fb na he doesn't know and searched the email I saw on his phone. Nothing came up and then I don't know what came to me but I searched his nickname and the boom 💥. A facebook came up with his nickname and face. My main fb is blocked on that fb. 

I stalked the fb and saw someone commenting there with an endearment. So sabi ko huh bakit my endearment to ayun I messaged si ate girl.

Sabi nya nagkita sila and naginuman nun eyeball nila and something happened, siguro 3x na my nangyari sa kanila tuwing magiinom sila pero wala daw sila relationship ang jowa daw no ex is yung DH sa ibang bansa, so I'm shocked like wth, di ako DH and nasa pinas ako. Binigay ni ate girl yung fb ng jowa kuno daw ni ex. 

I messaged her and dun ko na nalaman na 3 months na nya ko niloloko. Pero hiwalay na daw sila kasi nalaman din nya yung ka fbuddy ni ex. 

Naging friends ko mga kabit nya hehe.

Anyway, I confronted him, aba hindi sya nag paramdam like for a week. Kapal. Imagine ha the money I'm giving him and his family dun nya pinupunta sa ka fbuddy nya.

So yun nga, i forgave me, tanga eh. Pero nagloko uli, this time sa ML naman. I stalked his ML and meron sya lagi kaduo sa history. I messaged the girl na layuan si ex aba sya pa galit. 

Ending nag break kmi ni ex and naging sila na after 3 days.

LUNGKOT NA NAMAN SA PROM,"Hello po!  
Just wanted to share my story about my crush who dumped me, hahahhahahahahaha! Ayoko na ikuwento sa mga kaibigan ko kasi hiyang-hiya na ako at iritang-irita na sila sa akin so rito ko na lang siya ilalabas.  


Sa papalapit na prom namin, ngayon pa lang, tangina, nararamdaman ko na kaagad 'yung lungkot. I mean, siguro, blessing na rin 'tong maging single. Pero matatapos ba talaga 'tong high school journey ko na ni miski naka-stalking stage, eh, wala talaga (currently a grade 12 student). Naalala ko last year, love song na sa fete namin pero ka-holding hands ko friend ko simula elementary (thankful pa rin) tapos mga nakapaligid sa amin magjojowang nagyayapusan na at nagba-back hug ba, honetsly, kinakain talaga ako ng inngit, putangina, hahahahahha. Tapos ngayon paparating na naman, olats ulit.  


I confessed to this guy last November na crush ko siya na super formal pa ng introduction ko.  
""Allow me to formally introduce myself. I am \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*. I just wanted to express that I admire you. If you are currently in a relationship, please let me know, and I will respect that. However, if there isn't a lucky girl who has captured your heart, I look forward to getting to know you better. I hope for the opportunity to have a conversation with you."" Ganiyan pa atake ko, parang gago, todo grammarly at para double check pina-check ko na rin sa chatgpt 'yan. Akala mo maga-apply si gago sa trabaho. Sinabi niya naman kaagad na hindi pa siya ready (sign na ayaw niya sa akin na hindi ko kaagad nakita). Since makulit ako, kinausap ko pa rin nang kinausap. Nagbigay pa ako ng sketchpad nung Valentines tapos nagpa-picure na siyempre kilig na kilig ako. Binabati ko pa siya na happy weekend tuwing Friday, yes, tuwing Friday lang ako nagpaparamdam kasi ano ba, aral muna tapos tuwing Friday lang lalandi, ganiyan.  


Tapos, tangina, nung ni-stalk ko art account niya (daily routine), nakipag art trade siya tapos this time babae na, huhuhuhuhuhu. Then napansin ko laging naka-heart siya sa profile nung girl simula January. At, na-feel ko na talaga na may something sila kasi nagka-followan na sa big three (Facebook, Instagram, at TikTok. Gumawa siya account sa TikTok tapos sa girl lang naka-follow). Bigla ko tuloy naalala 'yung swimming activity namin na sobrang papansin pa ako noon habang kumakanta siya tapos nanghingi pa ako permission na videohan siya tapos nag-agree naman siya. Hindi naman talaga ako nage-expect na magustuhan niya rin ako (nage-expect ako, hehehehe) pero ang sakit, hahahahhahahah. Kasi, putangina, gusto ko talaga siya, as in, ang weird. Akala ko, magbubunga na ang pagpapapansin ko nung swimming, sobrang ni-complement ko pa siya sa pagkanta niya sa videoke na pagkahaba-haba tapos ang reply niya ay ----  


""Ty!""  


Tanginang 'yan, essay sinabi ko tapos 'yung thank you hindi pa buo. Asang-asa ako na magkakaroon na ng rising action kasi ang dami naming interaction that day tapos waley. Nakakaulol kasi stalk pa rin ako nang stalk sa account nila tapos siya naman react nang react dun sa girl na taga Visayas pa ang nais like boy ako sa taas lang ng floor niyo, imz. Nag-champion ako sa Journalism nung DSSPC tapos ni-like niya, wala, sakit. Sa totoo, naging delulu rin naman ako at tanga, heheheheheh. Ang weird pa kasi mga ini-interview ko na kilala siya laging sinasabi na huwag na sa kaniya pero GUSTONG-GUSTO ko talaga siya, fuck. Gusto ko na mamaalam sa kaniya pero parang gago naman ako na i-chat siya tapos sasabihing ba-bye, buang.  


Hanggang academics lang talaga ako, huwag na umasa sa love life. Bubuhatin ko na bangko ko, may mga nagkakagusto naman sa akin pero hindi pinupursue, hahahahahah. Tsaka para sa akin, mukha naman akong matino at hindi gagawa nang karumaldumal na krimen. Maganda ako, imz. If kulelat ngayong high school paano na sa college.  


Ang oa ko naman, hahahahahah.  
Hindi mo man ako magustuhan, isu-sureball ko na lang na ako magba-valedictorian sa batch natin, diyan man lang makabawi ako, imz (pareho pa naman kaming top student). Tapos ano sana pumasa sa UP, hahahahhaa.  


STEM student ay iwasan upang buhay ay gumaan, imz. Siyempre sa haba ng kuwento ko, crush ko pa rin siya.

Two girl friends told me I am their “girl crush” a few years ago and,"Grabeng compliment un? Iba pala dating pag galing sa kapwa mo babae. 

1st girl: she liked my years-old photo on IG and commented “stalking you” “you’re my girl crush” “😍😍😍” on three separate IG posts

2nd girl: I am simply blockmates with this person, we’re not close or friends, even. But there’s this one time when I was talking to my friend (who happens to be her friend as well) and this girl was staring at me. She then told my friend, “look at her, ang ganda niya.” 

Pero some part of me don’t believe na it’s true..? Di kasi ako nagagandahan sa sarili ko cos I’m petite and banlag eyes. So part of me thinks na they’re saying it cos wala lang. Pero at the same time, kilig pa rin. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1bvps8s/two_girl_friends_told_me_i_am_their_girl_crush_a/,t2_exmyq81d,2024-04-04 23:16:58,10,4
ldr things,"ang hirap talaga ng ldr, lalo na kapag inaatake ka ng gut feeling haha

kanina nagtataka ako bakit di pa nagmemessage yung bf ko haha usually kasi magcchat na 'yon kapag tantya niya ay gising na ko.

may mga iba rin namang instances in the past na di siya nakakapagchat agad, and the logical part of me knows na in the randomness of human life, there should be inconsistencies in patterns every now and then. pero minsan talaga nakakapraning lang haha, tinawagan ko siya tapos sinagot naman niya pero bago pa ko chumikka, bungad niya agad, ""may pinabili nanay ko.""

ok? di naman ako nagtatanong haha at di ko rin naman malalaman at di rin naman relevant. baka gusto lang niya i-share, ok sige :)) pero ewan ko baaaaa iba pakiramdam ko

mahilig kasi 'to magpalusot haha pano ko alam? kasi sinasabi niya sakin kapag nagpapalusot siya sa iba (mom, kapatid, kaibigan, trabaho) saka may mga instances before sakin minsan pero huli e tapos pinagusapan namin at sabi naman niya, he'll think of me as an ""accomplice"". kaya minsan sa totoo lang, naiisip ko ginagamit lang niyang excuse mom niya sakin. sana naman hindi.

anyway, kung sakali mang may nilalandi 'to, sana maging matalino yun HAHA stalk stalk ka rin girl nang mahanap mo ko at malaman mong ako ay nag-eexist. 

i-public ko paminsan twitter ko at ig, galingan mo haha

my stages of going thru heartbreak pt 2,"baby steps:
in the one month of trying to heal, i’m proud to say that i have started to slowly accept the fact that hindi na yun babalik. inalis ko na yung mga binigay niya sa akin and kept it in a box. deleted the screenshots of our cute messages. changed my phone case where i kept the dried petals from the flowers he’s given me. stopped wearing the clothes that remind me of him. i did not do all that in the same day or consecutively. they were done days or weeks apart. whenever i just felt ready. 

it comes in waves:
eto talaga yung pinaka frustrating na part. minsan i feel kind of free from him kasi those tiktoks don’t make me sad anymore pero minsan ang sakit parin talaga like it was the first day. im looking forward to the time na my heart won’t beat so fast out of anxiety when i hear his name from my friends or when i see pictures of him with them. i have slowly accepted the fact na ganun talaga. sometimes okay ako, sometimes hindi but that’s completely okay and part of the process. minsan gaslighter din ako sa sarili ko eh so di talaga ako sure if okay ako minsan.  just because you were triggered doesn’t mean you haven’t healed some. it takes time to repair wounds.

bad habits:
despite my baby steps, i still fall into very bad habits. exhibit a: stalking. minsan i would wonder if he’s having a hard time as much as me and i would stalk. it looks like he’s doing okay and i would be sad na he isn’t he having a hard time like i am. disclaimer lang, im happy that he’s okay pero a part of me feels shitty na baka one sided yung sakit. pero on the bright side, it helped me rin kasi mataas pride ko and if he’s okay then i should be doing okay too. the stalking is my way of getting my daily dose of him but it’s been really unhealthy. i stalk nalang kahit saan (fbi girly here). 

hearing about him from friends:
eto yung recently lang. my friends are hesitant to even mention his name to me at all because alam nila about us. they still have a genuinely close relationship kasi we met through them and im very happy na ganun parin. im happy na he’s still comfy na mag spill sakanila. recently, i found out they had a hangout where napagusapan nila yung about us. i don’t want to elaborate baka lurker pala friends ko here. long story short, i found out that he’s been having trouble with relapsing to the point na they made a bet. may consequence siya if he relapses. i found out na may time na he was close to messaging me. finding out this new information, my progress of moving on came crashing down. now i know were both suffering and it sucks kasi if both gusto ang isat isa makausap then bakit hindi pwede? i’m such a why girlie. i know it’s more complicated than that and honestly if we have both separate lives in opposite ends of the world then we simply cannot work. i have my new life here and he has his there. his life is there.  sometimes we just have to make sacrifices. i feel like i didn’t fight for it enough and i wonder if he’s feeling the same way. it makes me feel a little better knowing that i’m not feeling like shit alone and he’s feeling it too out there. the downside on my end is that i don’t have my friends w me physically to distract me and make me feel better. i’m the type of girl who’d talk about it over and over until i get over it. i feel bad for always bringing him up and i don’t want them to feel like they can’t talk to me about anything else bec all i talk about is the breakup. so i made this post. i wanted to give an update about how my breakup is doing but i don’t think my friends want to hear it anymore.

the new goal:
i’m trying to practice “out of sight, out of mind” it’s really hard but i know i’ll eventually get there. i need to stop hearing his name, hearing about his whereabouts, stalking him, etc. any form of him without blocking him. i know i can do it. maybe i’ll update again when it’s been a few couple months.

Moving on...,"Basically, I ceased interacting with someone I liked a month ago. I was friendzoned and we decided to remain good friends kasi I realize that's how important she is to me. I was fine with it, kasi sabi niya di pa naman daw talaga siya ready.

Then recently, she started entertaining a suitor. They went on dates, had kisses, and sleepovers, and I was like, yeah I don't feel so good.

I know medyo selfish na on my part, pero I blocked her kasi yoko makita mga posts.

Ang di ko maintindihan is...I stalk her on a dummy account. I want to move on, I really do, but this toxic habit is preventing me.

TL;DR I blocked the person I like to avoid seeing lovey dovey posts with her new suitor but I'm stalking her on a different account. I need help to get out of this unhealthy habit.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/v2kb0z/moving_on/,t2_gyoa6ql1,2022-06-02 00:01:01,50,27

unnecessary breakup guilt,"So, my ex and I called it quits on March 1, 2021. Just when I was getting the hang of things, life threw me a curveball. Landed a new gig, scored a promotion, and started seeing someone new just three months later. I feel some guilt cuz I feel na maybe it's just too fast or something. Fast forward to the day I had to whip up a new Facebook account for work. Figured I'd do a little stalking on my ex. Exactly a year and a month later.

Guess what? She's had a boyfriend since April 6, 2021. Their first anniversary is right around the corner—talk about timing, huh? My guilt vanished when I realized I wasn't the only one moving on during our final days. We even tried patching things up, but it only lasted until mid-March.

Mahal na Mahal daw ng Asawa ko 😞,"Kanina, hubby came home from a two day vacation with his employees. Pagod na pagod siya so I let him be and natulog na siya while I take care of our 4m/o baby. 

Nag punta ako ng warehouse and nag kwentuhan kami ng mga tauhan niya. Since kami kami lang (3 including me) na careless na siguro ung isa and nadulas siya. Apparently sabi ng husband ko mahal na mahal niya raw ung ex niya before and gusto niya raw noon makipag balikan pa sakanya. I don’t know the rest kasi sabi ko sa Tauhan “ah oo kilala ko yang ex niya na yan. Aware naman ako dyan” (matagal na daw ito nabanggit ng husband ko and ung employee na un wala pang isang taon samin) and change topic na. I’ve caught him so many times chatting/ viewing/liking/ and stalking her pero it still hurts when I think about all those times na umiiyak ako begging him to just let me be kung mahal niya pa ung girl. 

Ngayon dapat I feel secure kasi mag asawa na kami at may anak na pero may malaking pain parin talaga sa puso ko and kahit kailan hindi na ata mag hihilom.  I just want to get this off my chest. Ang hirap pala once you realize it’ll never be just you, I’ll always be the second best. 

Sana mag ka divorce na sa Philippines, maybe I can restart my life all over again and find someone na ako lang talaga ang mahal, minamahap, at mamahalin.

my boyfriend still attracted to other women at nakakasawa na punyeta,"my boyfriend and I are together for almost 2 years now. And since last year nasabi ko sakaniya na ayaw ko pinag aawayan ang mga babae kasi it ruins everything sa rs.


First: i saw his recently ig following na girls who posts sexy pictures (i have no against girls who posts picture na ganon, I'd support them pero kasi the fact na we are together, he is committed already, why pa-ganon? Na confront sya and he unfollowed those girls naman pero wtf parin, hindi parin sya nag babago.


Second: I always see sa ig nya in discovery/search tab na laging lumalabas puro baba na sexy pics eh algorithm yun na kung ano mostly navview mo o sinesearch mo lalabas dun.


Third: sa tiktok, i saw his watched history on tiktok there's this certain girl na pinanuod lahat ng tiktok niya kasi sumasayaw ng sexy... hindi rin ako against dun kasi marami talaga sa tiktok, hindi sana masakit kung famous yung girl pero hindi eh haha hindi naman famous yung girl he just stalked her to watch lahat ng video ng babae, as in lahat talaga. sympre some boys after watching those kind of vids eh ma-arouse talaga, u know whats next after that.

sawang sawa na ako, tangina micro/cheating na ba to, na he's attracted to other girls while having me, puta ako nga once committed hindi na ako naattract sa iba as in, lahat ng attention ko naka-tuon sakaniya at lust' ko. Masakit kasi hindi niya ako nirerespeto, yung feelings ko hindi nya nirerespeto, yung rs namin hindi niya nirerespeto and as days goes by alam ko hindi na same yung love ko for him. nakakasawa, paulit ulit. Hindi naman ako nagkulang, i send n* des pics when he asked and we vid ourselves, pero bakit sya ganon? puta addiction na yan eh, personality na nya talaga mag hanap ng ganong babae. Masakit sakin nafeel ko I wasn't enough, i wasn't attractive for him na kaya sya ganon. Na para bang while andito ako he’s gonna look for more na mas nabibigay yung pangangailangan nya sa lust, ang feeling ko parang i need to compete sa mga ganong babae para lang di na sya maattract sa iba.

Wala naman anywhere sa profile ko na nagsasabing ganun yung hanap ko. HAHAHA ibigsabihin that's what he thinks I deserve? He wants to better himself for me. Ang cute lang. I stalked his profile, feeling ko he's a few years younger than me. Early 20s and nag aaral pa.

Makakahanap pa yan ng dream girl nya na iba. Natuwa lang ako na ganun effect ko sa kanya, na that's how he see me. Kumbaga he feels na he's undeserving so he has to improve muna.

Stop spreading your exes nudes!!,"This happened a few weeks ago so I talked to this guy I met on bumble and we we're talking na sa ig, we also played some games and blah blah. Fast forward he asked my fb handle which I gave naman tapos super random siya nag chat ""Idk if you find this bastos"" And I replied with sure basta wag ka lang mag send ng tite 😭😭😭 HAHAHAHAA. Then he sent a photo of him eating a girls boobs with a caption ""I eat tiddies"" ??? WTF MAN. I said that he shouldn't do that and it made me verryyy uncomfortable. I did not talk to him again after that I unfollowed him on everything.

Tapos inistalk ko si guy sa fb tapos nakita ko yung repost ng story memory niya, it was an anniversary gift from his ex with gift and them kissing tapos I saw the girl. she's very familiar!!! Siya yung nasa picture na sinend ni kuya. I stalked her and yep confirmed nga.  

Pinag isipan ko nang mabuti kung sasabihin ko ba kasi baka magsumbong si girl kay guy edi malalaman na ako nag sumbong kasi ako recent na kausap 💀 but then, naisip ko na baka hindi lang ako yung sinendan and sobrang konsensiya ko kay ate girl huhu. So I made a dummy account and told her everything with receipts and the photo as well. She replied na it's her ex and hindi siya makapaniwala na ganun ginagawa ng ex niya sa kanya. She also said to me na she'll file a report sa pinag tatrabahuhan ng guy sa states. So ayun I'm very happy na sinabi ko kay ate girl huhu. 

Very red flag din yung guy asf we started talking and he's love bombing me with ""I love you's"" and has an anger management issues. 😭😭

Nang dahil sa Instagram,"Before my boyfriend and I became official, I stalked his following on Instagram. He followed a lot of nude Instagram models and I managed to shrug it off, since hindi pa naman kami that time.

1-2 months into our relationship, I brought it up. He explained na it's what popped out of his feed when he was new to IG. A few weeks after, I noticed his following decreased. I clicked and saw he had unfollowed those models.

Pero earlier, I stalked his following again. He started following these kinds of models again. And it feels like a huge slap to the face because he knows how I'm still working on my insecurity issues, he knows how much I cried because of my low self esteem, and he knows that he's the only person I've ever dated because napakababa talaga ng tingin ko sa sarili ko.

Idk if i'm being OA but it feels like parang may nag-iba, parang a part of our relationship won't be as secure anymore. Idk if I want to continue with a feeling like this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/163we6t/nang_dahil_sa_instagram/,t2_5r4jabz0,2023-08-29 04:03:37,3,1
Red days ahead at naiisip nanaman kita,"Nandito nanaman yung urge to stalk your profile just to see how you are doing. Eto nanaman yung gusto kita i-reach out with hopes to work things out again. Ayan nanaman yung mga tanong kung saan ako nagkamali at nagkulang; mga tanong kung bakit mo ako binitawan at nagawang palitan agad-agad.  

Isang taon na tayong wala. Ayos na rin na sa tuwing may regla nalang ako kita naaalala, hindi katulad dati na hindi dadaanan ang isang araw na hindi kita naiisip. Pero huwag naman sana kada buwan ganito. Masakit pa rin. Sana makausad na ako nang tuluyan.

why are you happy when you’re the one who cheated?,"Ang unfair lang ng buhay haha

While I’m still here grieving and questioning my worth, you’re so happy with your new girl na ang rason kung bakit ka nag cheat. I stalked your account at ang saya mo kasama siya, kasama mga kaibigan at kaklase mong mga kunsintidor at mga sulsol. All your pics sa classroom at mga gala niyo, ang touchy niyo sa isa’t isa haha.

Parang wala lang sayo yung years na pinagsamahan natin. I felt like you easily discarded me. Now I know I was only a placeholder in your life. You really didn’t loved me, you only chose me because I was the only person who was there for you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1bfatwy/why_are_you_happy_when_youre_the_one_who_cheated/,t2_uxu4pj9kg,2024-03-15 18:31:32,6,3
Guess it's really time to uncrush...,"Been crushing on a friend for over a year now. Never nagka-guts mag confess, at some point, nag assume ako na he also felt something but it wasn't strong enough to make him pursue me. Our circle never knew I had feelings for him. Today, they talked about this girl he's pursuing. Went home and stalked the girl. Pretty, matalino, came from a wealthy family, and they already attended her cousin's wedding with him. They looked so good in their photos. Like a match made in heaven.

Filipino virtual streamers and their hidden identities,"Are you guys familiar with this community? Where they're creating their own animated persona, who'll they use to stream online?
 
Onting background bago ko ikwento.
 
In early 2023, I started dating my now boyfriend. He has a virtual streamer ex, and I found out because I always stalk my boyfriend online. I saw his old posts and tags mentioning that streamer's screen name.
At first, I thought it was just her name, but when I noticed his shirt (apparently a merchandise shirt of that streamer) having the same name, I was curious, like, 'Who's this? His favorite anime? ' kaya sinearch ko na sya at lumabas is virtual streamer; it all adds up na lang if you're not dumb enough to comprehend na it's all just the same.. person.

As i said palagi ko nas-stalk boyfriend ko, kahit sa online games, and I saw na magka-squad pa din sila, of course, napa visit ako don.
 
Currently, there's no issue at all, but back then, it was so exhausting to love someone who came from a 4-year relationship and had a lot of reminders that she existed first in his life, so naiinis ako every time na may nakikita akong gamit na regalo nya, and ayoko rin gawin at puntahan yung mga memories na reused na. It felt like a competition, so I started to just appreciate myself more.
 
Months later, eto na nga, nag chat yung friend ni ex sa boyfriend ko, accusing me na dino-doxx ko daw tong ex nya, dahil may nag kakalat ata ng real identify nya dahil daw nasa  ml visits ako, tapos may pinakita pa na Pinterest account, sabi ako daw yon HAHAHA so pinakita ko yung Pinterest ko wtf.
They didn't directly talk to me, so I tried to be the bigger person and reached out to clarify things, and it went well. Maayos sya kausap, mabait naman.
 
December 25 naging kami na, December 27 may nag chat nanaman sa boyfriend ko, which is yung ex na mismo saying the same thing, na I'm doxxing her daw, and napa wtf ako kasiiiiii akala ko ba okay na? Apparently, hindi pala sya tinigilan, and ako nanaman yung sinisisi.

her reason? My likes and reposts about how to deal with retroactive jealousy. HAHAHAHA. 
THIS GIRL STALKED ME AND CREATED AN ASSUMPTION BASED ON WHAT SHE SAW.
BRO, IF I COULD JUST SHARE HER CHATS HERE LIKE
""bakit gumigitna pa din ako sa inyo, matagal na kami wala, hindi kita kilala, mag move on ka na"" stuff. BWHAHAHAHAHAH
Bro, I was so shocked that time because I didn't know where she was coming from..
Sa point of view ko, nag repost ako, I'm having a good time with my life, friends, and him, I'm expressing my emotions then suddenly may ganong eksena AHAHAHA
i mean? Yeh sometimes nakakapag usap kami ng boyfriend ko about how i feel about his past na i hate the fact na she knows him well, stuff like that na hindi naman dapat ilabas na, sa amin na lang dalawa, tapos biglang mag-iinterfere si girl sa mga na fe-feel ko just because she thinks kinakalat ko identify nya HAAHAHAHA
Idk, it felt like I lost track sa pag-kwe-kwento pero kasi mukang ewan si girl. HAHAHAHAHAH

I volunteer as kabit! ,"Throwaway account lang.

Long story short: Nagkakilala kami sa 3-day joiner tour sa Coron. Nagkasabay yung group namin sa 3 days na yun. Alam ko may asawa siya since kasama niya dun si wifey with their group of friends.  Super attracted agad ako sa kanya kahit alam kong he's taken.

He's exactly my type - gwapo, macho, gentleman, maalaga sa partner. As in alagang alaga niya talaga asawa niya. Kulang nalang siguro subo-an niya ng pagkain. I've always wanted to be loved like that. But not just by anyone, I want HIM.

The problem is, di siya interested saken. Lage akong naka stalk sa kanya sa socmed. I've also messaged him in FB at IG multiple times, pero di niya talaga ako pinapansin. Ni remind ko siya na ako yung girl na tinulungan niyang maka-balik sa bangka kasi di ko ma i-pull-up yung sarili ko (yes, nag pretend ako na di ko kaya sumampa ulit sa bangka nung nakita ko na siya yung nasa likuran ko). Nag respond lang siya isang beses ng thumbs up. Kilig na kilig pa ako nun. But after that wala na talaga.

Di ko alam bakit sobrang obsessed ako sa kanya, pero here we are, 1.5yrs in, and nagpapapansin parin. Kung pinatulan niya ako, matagal na akong naging kabit.

I want to be rid of him. Pero di ko talaga kaya. Parang di completo yung araw ko na di nakikita anong ganap niya. Buti nalang talaga naka public yung profile nung asawa niya, at least nakikita ko parin mga ganap niya.

Mga friends ko pagod na talaga saken. Di ko rin alam bakit di ko siya ma let go.

Yun lang. Fire away...",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1bypn2d/i_volunteer_as_kabit/,t2_g2mkft5ii,2024-04-08 13:07:16,0,55
Ang labo talaga hahaha,"So I'm still here currently at work, gusto ko lang naman sabihin na putang-- de joke lang hahahahaha. Ewan lang I'm supposed to do a first meet-up/date later 5:00 pm after my duty and her kakain sana ng dinner sa labas but hindi na tuloy hahahahahaha. 

Here's a little background: We matched on a dating app few days ago and then lumipat kami sa telegram ayun the casual usap usap muna getting to know each other and then okay naman kami sa chats then it transition sa lagi ng calls kami nag-uusap kasi hindi rin naman siya text/chat person mas bet nya daw phone calls and okay lang din naman sakin iyon. And then ayun nga okay naman kami lately like goods yung vibes namin sa calls or pag-naguusap kami ganto ganyan kaya feeling ko irl mag-jajive talaga kami sa company ng isa't isa so I decided to meet her up na agad (oo masyadong mabilis para sa iba but naramdaman ko naman kahit sa pag-uusap palang na ""goods kami neto IRL sa tingin ko"" and then going back tas she asked na what's my facebook account and ayun we added each other na yesterday thursday. So ayun syempre stalk stalk ako and siya, I find her okay naman physically and at my age bracket bonus nalang sakin yung physical appearance I mean yes wala naman nainlove agad sa ugali ng tao syempre physical attraction pa rin naman pero ayun nga sa edad kong ito (27 yo.) yung thinking ko is hindi sya big deal or mas mag-mamatter sakin yung personality ng tao at syempre praktikal lang kung may ibang pinag-kakaabalahan sa buhay ex. work etc. Ayun nga mas impt. for me kung swak ugali namin pareho, nag-eenjoy kami sa company ng isa't isa and we always meet in the middle. 

Then eto na, Today Friday kaninang morning nag-chat pako sa TG na good morning ingat ka sa work kumain ka na ba ganyan tas sumagot naman na nasa work na sya then andito nako sa work late nako nakabasa ng msg dahil toxic ang nature of work ko lol and ayun nga chineck ko phone ko (hoping na nag-follow up chats pa) but ufortunately waleyyyy HAHAHA eto pa malala buti sana kung ganon lang potangena mhie deleted yung buong convo HAHAHAHA dunno na may ganong kineme pala ang TG na pwedeng idelete kahit msgs ko akala ko kasi yung kanya lang pweds nya idelete lol. So sadly ayun na nga nangyari so one thing is for sure hindi ako pasok sa physical preferences nya (yung nag-stalk sya sa fb) but siztttt sorry hindi din naman sya pasok sa preferences ko physically 😭 hahahaha talagang I'm happy pag nag-uusap kami and nagustohan ko yung energy nya kapag nag-uusap kami like I've said bonus na nga lang yung panlabas at mas nag-matter na talaga sakin yung the way kami mag-usap. So hindi ko na rin makita profile sa fb kapg sinearch ko inunfriend ako tas baka blocked na rin? Ewan. Sa TG di pa naman naka-blocked hahaha. Sa dating app naka-unmatched na din ako 🙃😂 

Kaya ganyan ang title ""ang labo talaga"" kasi nag-uusap kami sa phone the other day mas importante daw sa kanya na kung mag-kiclick ugali irl wala naman daw sya preferences sa physical ganun una palang din sinabi ko na, na ilapag nya na agad preferences/standards nya for us to save each other's time and be matured enough nalang na if hindi pasok just say it straight na agad tas biglang boom! HAHAHAHA anyway, I'm not that ugly naman din alam ko sa sarili ko hahaha siguro 6-7/10 ganyan, skinny built, wears glasses, 5'4 ht, moreno, may stable na job may savings naman din, wala lang kotse HAHAHA planning palang kumuha 🥴, marunong naman kumpletong sentences kapag nag-chachat, matured naman to handle such things sa relationship, di naman nag-dedemand ng time mo lalo na kung working ka kasi may other priorities din us in life, alam ko naman pano gamitin ang you're at your their they're were we're, may since of humor naman etc. Kaya ayun nalabuan lang ako HAHAHAHA na mas impt. naman daw sa kanya ay ganyan ganyan lol. Sayang naman pumorma pa naman ako today nilabas ko na yung pangmalakasan kong pormahan pati perfume charotttt HAHAHA pero yun nga napansin din ng mga ka-work ko yung isa ngang girl na kawork pogi ko raw today tas napapatitig kasi minsan lang nila ako makita na ganto sa work kaya alam nila may date ako hahahahahaha kasi alam ko naman paano ayusin sarili ko, to look presentable sa date hahahaha. Pero ayun nga mas okay na rin siguro kesa natuloy pa tas I might got stood up or biglang umalis in the middle iwan ganun hahahahaha. Diko alam if andito ka sa community na to pero gusto ko lang din kasi ilabas hahahaha.

Sorry mahaba ty sa pag-basa kung nakarating ka here. Tanggap ko ng mag-papastol nalang talaga ako ng tupa in life 🥲😂 akala ko hahabol nako sa Feb. 14 kineme di pala, instead na truelove, truema pala nakuha HAHAHAHA. Ayun lang nais ko lang ilabas. Salamattttt!!! Ingat peeps!

Edit: ang hirap makatagpo ng taong you wanna settle with na in life sa gantong age bracket 🥹 pero I know for sure may kanya kanya naman tayong nakalaan, kung walang nakalaan para saken Lord ako na po mismo mag-rereto ng babae para saken 😭 HAHAHA

The LIP/gf of my boyfriend’s eldest brother might be cheating on him,"I need to get this off my chest because it’s bothering me whenever I see either his kuya or both (the kuya and the gf).

So, I have a boyfriend. He’s the youngest amongst the three siblings. His eldest brother has a girlfriend, like a live-in partner because the girl lives with him (at least, she gets home to the eldest brother’s house most of the time). The girl is an FA.

I’ve always had a bad feeling about this girl even though I am the one who’s new to their family. I stay with my boyfriend and his mom at least 3-4x a week, so I get to meet and see his eldest brother kasi he lives nearby, like 3-5 mins away kasi different subdivision lang.

Just to note, the middle brother is married and has kids. The wife doesn’t bother me as much as this eldest brother’s gf.

Anyway, I stalked the gf. Faceook. Instagram. Tiktok. The gf is quite popular I must say? Because she has thousands of followers on Tiktok and Instagram. She has a dump account with a bio that has an initial like (J🤍). Then, when I stalked her Fb, I saw a guy from her facebook profile whose name starts with an J.

The J guy has a post on his Fb account, photos of him and the gf of the eldest. The photos had been posted last Christmas. The photos looked like they were on a date. It was at a nice restaurant in Makati. They were having steak. No kissing or anything, it looks like a normal post of a couple on a date night, except that in this case, the girl is the gf my bf’s eldest brother. The post says Merry Christmas and the gf of the eldest commented “Merry Christmas 😘”. 

My bf’s eldest brother (their whole fam) is nice and kind. I just have this feeling that she is cheating on him and nobody deserves that. To add, if you are going to check the girl’s social media accounts, she has not posted anything about the eldest brother, considering that they’ve been together for at least 3 or 4 years and are living together. 

I shouldn’t be privy about their relationship but this is my boyfriend’s eldest brother. 😭",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1b1kr6h/the_lipgf_of_my_boyfriends_eldest_brother_might/,t2_pazeb5xk1,2024-02-28 03:35:46,1,3
Insane Redditor,"Whatever your name is, leave me alone and stop making up stories on comments I leave. I don’t even understand the need to stalk and non stop create new reddit accounts!??!? I barely replied to your DMs and never told you anything about me. You’re just obsessed with your idea of what kind of person I am based on the comments you’ve seen, and somehow you convinced yourself I need you in my life (yes he’s that crazy). I’ll admit the only reason I replied to you is because I was bored and thought talking to a stranger would be refreshing. I didn’t even say much and most of the time I send one liners. I was honest with you when I told you I wasn’t interested and when I finally blocked you, you cracked.

Approaching my 30s na SINGLE... Tanggapin ko na ba that I'm gonna grow old alone?,"These aug holidays, have been quiet. No dates, no hangout with friends, no ka flirty chats... just me. Also havent been scrolling a lot on socmed than usual... no more stalking sa ex... di ko na feel eh. So quiet, peaceful... yet sometimes so... lonely (?)

These nights when i dont have ka landian (hahaha!), as cliché as it is, can't help but think, will anyone still love me? Will i ever feel that kind of high in love again? To feel at home with anyone? What happened? What was my contribution to that breakup? Panget ba talaga ako? Char!

AM I GOING TO START ACCEPTING THE FACT THAT IM GONNA GET OLD ALONE? hahaha Parang eto na nga yon.  Strong independent vibes na dba? Am i gonna start being okay with that? Cuz really... and honestly... my hopeless romantic heart, this Disney Princess... isn't. hahahahaha!!!!

Sometimes, i feel embarrassed with my strong independent friends... na kaya talaga nila alone.... na THEY CAN LIVE WITHOUT A MAN tlga. Kebs lang. I feel embarrassed cuz why cant i be like them? when in fact, I AM LIKE THEM... i mean, hello, nbsb for 26 years. 🤣 (been in a rs for 3yrs kaya 29 na ako now)

And yet, here I am... getting emotional accepting the fact na, im gonna be 30 next year and maybe... wala talaga. Maybe im gonna be like my cousins na strong independent women in their 30s... mga pretty and single. Happy lang.

This February baby... love month girl, has to accept na maybe ka barkada ko cla kris aquino and heart evangelista (tho she's with chiz) ... mga hopeless romantic girlies na wala eh, ganun cguro? Pero tangina, ang hirap tanggapin? 🥺😭 HAHAHAHAHAHA",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/163jc38/approaching_my_30s_na_single_tanggapin_ko_na_ba/,t2_hc76q6n4,2023-08-28 19:17:47,58,55
She ruined my brother,"They were together for 5 years. Kuya, proposed last year. 
Called off the wedding two months ago. 

Last night, I stalked her soc med ( using a dummy account since she blocked me). She deleted all their photos na, and seemed to be in another country atm. Checked the comments and some of her friends were commenting/ hinting  why hindi daw niya pinopost yung new boylet niya which she replied ""wag muna baka kasi  madepress yung isa kawawa naman "" with laughing emojis

 T*NGINA MO, L. USER KA. I knew it, you've been cheating on my brother all this time. Pinagtatawanan mo pa sitwasyon ng kapatid ko. I so wanna get back at you  but I won't cause I know magagalit saken si kuya. Ang kapal ng face mo. Hindi mo ikinaganda ang pagiging two timer. 

I know he's not perfect but he did his best to keep her happy, was loyal to her, worked hard to give her wants,  gave her a home, supported her family even helped on paying for her sibling's  school. 
It's been over a month since kuya moved back but I still  don't have the heart to ask him what  really happened. Sabi ni tatay, he'll share naman once he's ready. Wag ko daw kulitin.
He's been drinking more than usual, gets triggered so easily even with small things ( he gets super angry when I would jokingly remind him to eat or take a shower), can't get a decent sleep so he would struggle to get out of bed. He's not the same person anymore. I've had my fair share of heartaches  but seeing him like this is just unbearable. 
I want my happy, makulit, matakaw kuya back :(

EDIT: Thank you guys for all your well wishes for my brother. I'm literally crying, idk why I'm so emotional. I read all your comments and thank you ❤️. 

I can't talk about this kasi with my friends cause I know that he trusts me not to, but it's just too heavy and I'm so bitter.  Seeing her post happy/carefree photos while my brother suffers. Like , b*tch I hope you choke on your bánh mì.

I am being patient because I know that moving on takes time.  And I will try my best not to be an annoying sister.
