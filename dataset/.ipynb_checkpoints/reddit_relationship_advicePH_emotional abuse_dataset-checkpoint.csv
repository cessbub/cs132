Is there a way for the emotionally abused boyfriend (28M) to have the full custody of his baby (3B) from his emotionally abusive girlfriend (28F)?,"May way ba para mapunta sa lalaki yung baby dahil sobrang abusive ng girlfriend nya? Not physically but emotionally. Lately lagi nasasabihan yung lalaki ng kung ano ano (""demonyo ka"", ""wala kang bayag"", ""gago ka"" at marami pang degrading words) ng girlfriend nya at lagi pinanakot sakanya na ilalayo sakanya ang bata. May times na pinapahiya na sya sa mga kaibigan nya, kaibigan ng babae at pamilya nya.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/122uosc/is_there_a_way_for_the_emotionally_abused/,t2_6j389n8kq,2023-03-27 02:17:46,2
"i (25F) want to move out because my mother (46F) is physically, emotionally and mentally abusive and i need a safer space to heal. ","hi redditph! it‚Äôs my first time posting here but before i get this off my chest, i just wanna say i appreciate all of you here.

so, here goes. (TW: abuse, sexual harassment, suicide attempt)

short bg, i‚Äôm 25F and the eldest daughter of a broken family. parents are separated but both already have their own partners now. i have 2 younger brothers, aged 23 and 16. 

i‚Äôve only been working for 2+ months because i graduated at 24. i never stopped school, i just transferred schools due to 3 separate incidents involving sexual assault, sexual harassment from a prof and theft by fraud. 

why am i telling you this? because it‚Äôs part of the reason why i want to move out‚Äîmy mother did not offer me support in circumstances like these wherein i needed the counsel of a parent. 

she didn‚Äôt believe i was sexually assaulted by a classmate. she instead screamed at me and asked me if i was drunk when it happened, what i was wearing, and if the guy who assaulted me was my boyfriend. (did not drink, was wearing my uniform and the guy was bi‚Äîhe had a bf and all.) i reported it to my former uni but also to no avail.

she never did anything about my prof who continuously harassed me for 2 years. i explained to her countless times that he kept asking me out to dinner and drinks, just me and him. he also keeps inviting me to chat through secret conversations in messenger. i never budged so he failed me on one of his classes. i lost my chance to be a dean‚Äôs lister because of him. she just shrugged it off like it was nothing.

although, she did something to my classmate/dormmate who failed to pay her share for rent that she borrowed from us. she had her blottered at 2 barangays. 

these are just a few examples of the challenges i faced in life. since then, i‚Äôm sad to say, i had to go through worse stuff and my mother still wasn‚Äôt there even after i reached out. 

apart from that, there‚Äôs also the pathological lying, violent tendencies and deep unresolved anger issues. 

lately i just realized she constantly lies about our family. she had been telling people that she paid for my tuition even if my dad did. (he rightfully deserves the credit.) the worst one was one time we were together and someone asked if i was her daughter, she denied it. 

there‚Äôs also the violence i can‚Äôt take anymore. whenever she gets upset with us while driving, she goes into a road rage. she speeds through highways to get her point across. she throws things at us and somehow i always get the brunt of it. the worst one happened last year and i finally had the courage to record it (sound recording). it was clear in the audio that she was hitting me while i was telling her it hurts. 

in 2014, i was diagnosed with major depressive disorder during my parents‚Äô initial break up. in 2020, i relapsed and (shamefully & regretfully) tried to take my own life. now i even developed severe anxiety and a slight eating disorder. i‚Äôm only 38kg at 5‚Äô2‚Äù. 

there are still nights when i feel too overwhelmed. but i never went to my mother again. i‚Äôm more scared of hearing what she‚Äôll say than of hearing my own last breath. 

i know that i make mistakes, sometimes it‚Äôs really my fault why she‚Äôs mad. i‚Äôm not the perfect daughter. i already constantly beat myself up for it‚Äîwithout them needing to add to it. 

but i finally see now that i don‚Äôt have to be perfect to be loved and cared for. i don‚Äôt deserve to be hurt anymore.

right now, my simple wish is to start my healing journey, far away from her. to have my own safe space, to establish new boundaries and to have a place to finally start living after being on survival mode for so long. 

i worry about my brothers but after i asked them, they confirmed that she never hit them, unlike me. and they know enough not to depend on her for emotional support. 

one of my brothers will be graduating and working soon too. but i promised my youngest brother that they both have the option to live with me if they wish. i only survived because of them. i want to give them a better life. 

but the thing is, even if my mother has been a great burden to my emotional, mental and physical wellbeing, she is still my mother. i still want to move out with her approval and blessing. i still want to support her financially and maybe when time comes, even more than that. because maybe i‚Äôm not the only one who needs therapy. i want to help her. when she‚Äôs ready too. 

me, i‚Äôm finally ready to put myself first. but how do i even start telling her that i‚Äôm moving out? do you have any advice for a situation like mine?

thanks, redditph! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/1armukf/i_25f_want_to_move_out_because_my_mother_46f_is/,t2_pid2dds1a,2024-02-16 02:48:15,1
I [M32] think I'm being emotionally abused by my 5-year live in partner [F28]. She randomly spouts infidelity jokes(?) and brags that masturbating is better than us having sex (she always asks for it). She's also very cautious when I'm glancing at her phone while she can freely use my phone anytime.,"I might be overreacting but this has been bothering me for quite some time now. There is also a time when I almost had a mental breakdown because of this. I'm not sure if it's just her sense of humor but it definitely is taking a toll on my mental health.

Breaking up with her isn't necessarily a good idea because we have a toddler daughter. I mean, I still love her and our daughter but it gets worse whenever she does it. I can laugh at it before but now, I am showing disgust.

Am I overreacting? And please give me any advice on how I can survive this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/17jswp6/i_m32_think_im_being_emotionally_abused_by_my/,t2_mulso4une,2023-10-30 21:03:23,6
I (20F) feel like im being too emotionally attached and reliant on my first ever bf (23M) which scares me.,"Me (20F) and my boyfriend (23M) have been together for almost a year (will be in march), he is my first boyfriend as well as I am his first girlfriend. Our relationship is really healthy, we are legal in both sides, and we know each other‚Äôs friends. It has been a routine for us to meet each other weekly, usually he goes to my house and we just watch movies and bond, but sometimes we also go outside. I‚Äôve been really accustomed to that and have found it very comforting to the point that I look forward to it every start of the week (we meet at saturdays). At times where we suddenly can‚Äôt meet, it affects me A LOT, I don‚Äôt just get sad, I legit cry. I don‚Äôt tell him this so he doesn‚Äôt get guilty whenever he can‚Äôt meet me, but idk I just get scared of the fact that I am becoming needy for the presence of my boyfriend. 

Honestly I think its because of my issues and traumas, I come from an emotionally abusive broken family, I find it very hard to really open myself up to someone because of this as to why I don‚Äôt really entertain guys before. But now that I have my boyfriend, Idk I discovered that I can be very needy pala. 

Im just scared because I don‚Äôt want to be a clingy annoying girlfriend and I am also scared of being too vulnerable. Because of my past traumas I want to be strong onf on my own but having my bf is changing that and it scares me.

Am I just overthinking this? Is this normal for a first relationship? any advice on how I should handle my feelings?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/199548q/i_20f_feel_like_im_being_too_emotionally_attached/,t2_hueqzxhy8,2024-01-18 03:21:52,30

"My (22NB) family who I have a low contact/strained relationship with, invited me to Christmas. Everyone thinks I should go, but I don‚Äôt want to","Hi, this is my first post, so I hope it makes sense. To start off I (22NB) do not have a good relationship with my parents (M50 and F50). From the time I was a kid all the way up to 19 years old, they emotionally abused me and refused to provide mental health support when I became very depressed. They were overall, very mean to me, and were incredibly toxic to my younger siblings as well. 

I am the eldest child of 3, and my family dynamic was very much that of the scapegoat, the glass child, and the golden child. I being the scapegoat, and my younger sibling we can call Riley(19) being the glass child, and my little brother we can call Evan(16), being the only boy and therefore the golden child. 

This obviously strained my relationship with my siblings quite a bit. Things continued to be strained until I turned 19 and had a terrible fight with my parents that resulted in me moving out of their house. At the time my younger siblings were still in high school and fully reliant on my parents, So I wasn‚Äôt surprised that my younger siblings sided with my parents. So I went low contact with my parents but still tried to maintain a relationship with Riley and Evan. That was in 2020, and since then, my parents and I have had on and off communication. It was mostly just awkward talks where I would try and get them to take accountability for how they treated me in the past, but it would always end with them denying everything, or telling me I needed to let go of the past and stop punishing our family for minor mistakes they may or may not have made. 

 This is how it has been for 3 years now. That is until this past June. Riley was home from school and wanted to meet up with me. It was a few daysas after my father had tried reaching out to me via text, that I read, but did not reply to. We ended up meeting up for a talk, where predictably, they tried to guilt trip me into talking to our parents, cause me ignoring them was making the entire family sad and upset. We went back and forth for a little, until they gave me an ultimatum, either I let go of my stupid grudges and talk to my parents, or we wouldn‚Äôt have a relationship. I tried to reason with them and tell them it didn‚Äôt have to be either or, but they ultimately decided they didn‚Äôt want to talk to me anymore. This was very sad to hear, but it was their decision and I respected it. I know that they still care deeply about my parents opinion, and the way they cut me off stems from them wanting to be close with my parents, so I don‚Äôt blame them. It just hurts cause it feels like I‚Äôm being ostracized for having boundaries. 

I haven‚Äôt spoken to Riley since then, but last time I heard from my father, they apparently told the whole family I was the one who cut them off and gave them the ultimatum. And now everyone in my extended family is telling me to go and make amends with Riley and my parents. But after 3 years of trying to improve things with my family, I‚Äôm tired. I‚Äôm tired of constantly being guilt tripped and gaslit, and I‚Äôm tired of ignoring how my family treats me for the sake of keeping peace. I need to tell my parents I don‚Äôt want to go, but I know it will cause a huge uproar in my family if I don‚Äôt. Should I just suck it up and go? Or should I stand firm in my decision. I just need some unbiased advice.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/18luxe6/my_22nb_family_who_i_have_a_low_contactstrained/,t2_q92kv2j4c,2023-12-19 14:05:10,10
A tragic story of my life. [Long Story],"Hi! Newbie here Age [26] I am a teenage mom at the age of 17 way back 2012 and been single mom for 2 years. Physical abuse ang unang tatay ng anak ko and drug addict kaya nag hiwalay kami. I had been in relationship with another guy during my college. Wag nyo ko ijudge agad graduate po ako. I'd thought kami na for a lifetime we've been together for 6 years and had 2 kids na. But during those years pinanindigan ko na lang yung sarili ko na hanggang ulirang ina na lang ako at wala ng pangarap. Inalagaan ko yung mga anak ko sa kung ano ang kaya nyang iprovide samin. Minsan i have extra work sa mga kapatid ko to sustain our daily needs. Sa loob din ng 6 years napakaraming pang ccheat na ang naranasan ko. 8 girls in total. Pikit mata ko na lang kinakalimutan at nanghihingi ng pasensya sa mga naging karelasyon nya kahit ang sakit sakit na. Para lang sa mga bata. Pero naubos din ako. Napagod ako. Bukod sa ako na ang ulirang ina ay isa din akong dakilang anak para sa tatay ko na inaalagaan ko nung buhay pa dahil stroke and bedridden. At imbis na may emotional support ako sa lalaking pinagkatiwalaan ko ng buong buo, niloloko lang pala ako. He also been a gambler sa online sabong, playing cards sa mga tropa at kung ano ano pang online games. Buong buhay ko tinuon ko na lang sa pag aalaga sa mga responsibilidad ko. Nakipag hiwalay ako sa kanya. Sa dami ng dahilan. Year 2021 sumugal ako para mag work. Pero hindi ko kinaya yung nature ng work then I met this guy online (foreign) and we had late night talks habang nasa work ako during my stay. He advised me na umuwi samin at patuloy kong alagaan ang tatay ko sya na daw bahala sa sarili kong finances since hindi ko kinaya yung work umuwi ako. Na meet nya tatay ko on virtual pag ka uwi ko and 2 weeks after that namatay ang tatay ko. Hindi na kinaya. Now I am 1 year and 4 months na with my boyfriend abroad we met 4x na personally i visit him in singapore and i have my corporate work as a banker living independently. Pero kinakain ako ng emotional breakdowns ko dahil namimiss ko yung mga anak ko wala sakin. Hindi ko magampanan ang pagiging ina physically dahil feeling ko hindi ako handa. Natatakot ako na magalit sakin yung boyfriend ko which is ang tagal kong wala communications sa mga bata. Araw araw akong umiiyak gabi gabi akong nag bbreakdowns kapag hindi ako naging busy sa work. I never ever had any socialize dahil 24/7 akong on call sa kanya kasi parehas lang ng time dito sa PH. Gusto kong magwala bakit ganito yung naging sitwasyon ng buhay ko. üò≠",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/zl0j9j/a_tragic_story_of_my_life_long_story/,t2_uye82hnq,2022-12-14 00:56:38,0
"They say ignorance is bliss, pero pano ko hindi papansinin if may ex (F23) na epal ang bf (M20) ko (F21)","
context: they were together for 5 yrs‚Äî grounds of breakup was abuse and a ton of toxicity. broken up more than half a yr when my bf and I met. bf and i have been officially dating for 4 months, but known each other for almost 9 months. still no formal inteoduction to his fam, pero aware sila saken.  the ex still wants him, and i‚Äôm relapsing all over again. 

Akala ko talaga I was over it. Sobrang papansin lang kasi talaga nung ex eh. Nung last week of aug, nag celebrate ng bday  yung mama ng ex ko and the ex was part of the program. I attended the celebration as a guest, kasama ko yung bestfriend ng bf ko and bestfriend ko din. I observed kung paano sya ininclude sa table w immediate family. I saw din kung gaano ka close sya sa older sister ng bf ko.

The ex saw me. Nasa harap sya nung venue place, but kami sa may likod kami pumwesto and lumapit agad samin yung bf ko nung nakita niya kami. 

Towards the end of the night, the ex herself introduced me sa sister in law ng bf ko bilang girlfriend. Nagulat ako, pero I did my best to be polite nadin. 

An hours later, the ex reached out to me via socmed to explain her reasons on why she‚Äôs still involved sa family gatherings.Andami nyang sinabe, pero eto yung mga keypoints: 

‚ÄúGusto ko rin sana na ipakilala ka na para maka exit na talaga ako‚Äù

‚ÄúAlam ko naman na lugar ko kaya ako na mismo nagpapakilala sayo. Sadyang super close ako sa fam nya.‚Äù

‚ÄúGusto ko din i-respect yung rs niyo kasi yun yung dapat‚Äù 

‚ÄúNageexplain ako dahil ayokong isipin mo na pinipilit ko pa sarili ko dito or ginagamit ko yung fam ni *bf ko* para mapalapit sa kanya kasi matagal naman na kami wala and tanggap ko na‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry sa mga nangyayari, pero thank you padin sa pag intindi. If ako nasa sitwasyon mo, hindi rin talaga madali. Ayoko lang ng may nasasaktan‚Äù

‚ÄúI will make sure na gagawa din ako ng paraan para unti unti akong makaalis kasi ang hirap din sakin‚Äù 

Then 1 week later, inaya sya ng fam ng bf ko na sumabay sa byahe kasi dun sila pumunta sa place near where the ex works. Sumama sya. Yung bf ko and kuya nya, nasa bday but yung ex is nasa mall w his mom and older sister. 

3 weeks later, the ex posts on ig. 3 pictures pinost nya and lahat yun is from the bday of my bf‚Äôs mama. The last pic is a family pic na kasama sya tas nakatakip yung mukha ng bf ko w an emoji. If a few days after nya pinost, I‚Äôd be fine. Pero 3 weeks after nung bday tas may pa takip pa ng mukha? lol 

San banda dyan yung ‚Äúrespecting my rs‚Äù and yung will nya to make a way to fully exit? i smell bs lmao

My bf and I talked long and hard about this. Sobrang sama ng loob ko about dun sa bday na yun, pero pinili ko padin talaga intindihin dahil hindi rin madali sa bf ko yung sitwasyon and I don‚Äôt want to pressure him in any way at all. 

The reason why I‚Äôm relapsing is bc my bf invited me to his sister‚Äôs bday next month, kaso I‚Äôm 99% sure na invited din yung ex.  

My emotions are all over the place about this. I‚Äôm secure in my position bilang girlfriend, pero ang awkward kasi non if same place kami lol It‚Äôs almost as if merong isa samin na ayaw makiramdam hahahaha 

I badly need advice. I‚Äôm confused if napapanoverthink lang ako or valid naman?

p.s antigas ng mukha nya talaga sa part na pinost nya pa yung pics sa ig. madaming pic naman yon na hindi kasama bf ko, pero ininclude nya pa talaga yung kasama sya tas tinakpan ng emoji. her friends were going at it sa comments.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/16my6lt/they_say_ignorance_is_bliss_pero_pano_ko_hindi/,t2_bkv1wwn5,2023-09-20 02:15:21,18
I (20 F) no longer knows how to help deal with my Boyfriend(21M) ongoing depression or to help him get through it.,"I have been with my boyfriend for a little over 4 years now. High school sweethearts if you may. Before committing to this relationship, he made me aware that he deals with chronic depression. I understood him because I have PTSD and anxiety disorder. At first, his depression was being treated with antidepressants. He also went to therapy at that time. As our relationship progressed, he no longer took his medications and stopped seeing a therapist. Here and there he would have a depressive episode, but we would work through it together. Through his hard times, he would resort to porn or intimate photos. In the past, I‚Äôve discovered that he‚Äôs created alternative Instagram accounts to look up what he ‚Äúgets off to.‚Äù I‚Äôve told him that I find that inappropriate since he takes the time to get off to these intimate photos. That he takes the time to hide his inappropriate doings from me, and that he isn‚Äôt open to me. I‚Äôve told him I want complete honesty from him. I want him to tell me his urges so that we can resolve them together instead of keeping them a secret. I‚Äôve never told him this is cheating, but I have made him aware that this ruins my self-esteem. But, for the sake of the relationship, I‚Äôve never made his doings a big deal. He repeated his doings in secret throughout our relationship, I confronted him, then I accepted his apologies. He's even gone as far as subscribing to only fans without my knowledge. I found this out by looking at his phone notifications.   
Every time I‚Äôve confronted him about his Instagram accounts, he defends himself by saying I shouldn‚Äôt look through his phone. At this point, I have trust issues, and every time I have a feeling he‚Äôs hiding something, my intuition is right. After around the 3 ¬Ω year mark, I stopped snooping on his phone. I want to respect his privacy until recently.   
Since the beginning of 2023, he has been going through difficult hardships. I have been by his side 100% of the time. I care for him and his well-being. He has been battling with his depression for the entirety of this year with no breaks from it. I‚Äôve also had some difficult times because of the weight of the situation. I decided to see my therapist biweekly and start antidepressants. However, my boyfriend saw therapy as too expensive and not worth going to. So, his depression progressed. He would lash out by yelling at me, making rude remarks, and somewhat abusing my EAS, Cashew (cat). At the end of June, I almost ended our relationship because I couldn't deal with his lashouts, and not taking care of his health. Now, he goes to therapy, but I feel like nothing is changing. He no longer lashes out at me but still does toward my cat. He still lays his emotions on me. His negative mindset is exhausting. He‚Äôs not directing his anger toward me anymore but lays his emotions on me. I feel like I have nothing to be upset about. I‚Äôm fine with helping him get through a hard time, but he hasn't done much to help himself. He works less than 20 hours a week, stays up all night, and sleeps all day. I‚Äôve never made a rude comment about his routine, but encouraging thoughts about his health. He talks about suicide but mainly hides his feelings because he knows it is hard for me to hear since I‚Äôve had a failed attempt before. He has told me he has recurring thoughts about suicide. However, I recently found out that he posts youtube videos of what he gets off to, privately. He has multiple videos that he has extracted from other videos for his satisfaction. He has uploaded it to his youtube burner account recently. It hurts me because I‚Äôve been here for him 100% of the time. I‚Äôve supported him throughout his hardest moments. I did not go onto his phone snooping, but I saw a Youtube notification about how his videos are not age appropriate.   
I feel like my support does not mean enough to him. I feel like I am the reason he is always depressed. I try my best but get nowhere. He continues to hide what he gets off to, knowing I don‚Äôt agree with his actions. I want to confront him, but I hate to lay on more stress and potentially worsen his depression.   
What should I do? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/15v7o46/i_20_f_no_longer_knows_how_to_help_deal_with_my/,t2_6p5v4snyo,2023-08-19 13:50:32,3
I (27F) can't break up with my bf (31M) but I need to soon before we move in together this coming weekend,"God I am so ashamed to be writing this. Throwaway account because he follows my main... Also warning I talk about sex in this a bit...

I (27F) am having a really hard time breaking up with my (31M) boyfriend. We've been together about 6 months. I'll try to be detailed but not write a novel.

We met about 9 months ago in a education setting (being a little discrete here lmao or else it'd be kind obvious to everyone we know). It was a virtual setting and we just hit it off instantly. Immediately, diehard best friends. He fell in love with me and I fell in love with him in a matter of like 8 weeks. I was VERY FRESHLY coming out of a 6 year marriage and I was very emotional and hurt from that. But he was so kind and comforting. I felt like from him I was getting love, reassurance, and support that I've never gotten from anyone before. We planned on meeting in person for the first time after about the 9-10 week mark.

I was so nervous to meet him and I'm very very weird about sex, I told him a few times that I didn't want to have sex the first time we met in person. I had only every had sex with my ex before and I had had some not so good experiences that made me want to wait. He assured me I'd feel comfortable enough with him that I wouldn't have those concerns. When I pressed him by what that meant he was always pretty vague.

That combined with the fact that I was so raw from coming out of a relationship so recently, put me in a mindset of telling him I was too nervous to come visit him yet. I told him I was so sorry but I just needed a little more time to heal from my past relationship and work things out in my head before we get serious (he was already talking marriage and such at this point). I know it was shitty of me to cancel the same day. I felt horrible about it.

That was the first time I saw him lose his shit. He told me that I was fake, that I never really loved him, that I was just playing him and wanted to get back with my ex and that was why I wouldn't go to see him. He threatened me with dropping out of our education course because he was so hurt and couldn't handle seeing me everyday. I told him I wasn't breaking up with him (we had just started dating a few days prior officially) but just that I needed us to slow things down. He accused me of leading him on, which I kept getting confused about because I wasn't breaking up with him.

So I apologized and said I would come anyway, but I told him again I didn't want to have sex and to please be slow with me because I felt really fragile. He reassured me and stayed on the phone with me the whole drive over. He initiated sex with me and I didn't say no. I didn't say yes (I mean he didn't ask) but I didn't say no, so I don't count it as assault or anything. But my god that hurt my feelings so much. He assured me he'd go slow, but it happened in the first 10 minutes of meeting.

That was my confirmation that he didn't really respect me, even though to this day he tells me all the time he does.

After that his behavior totally changed. No more outpouring of sweet words or actions. He got mad all of the time. He still does. He yells at me about my tone constantly. That I have a bitchy tone, but really it's if I have anything but my very happy tone he gets upset.

The fights were usually in that vein or him telling me I'm cheating because I didn't answer a phone call fast enough (that was really only 3 times though).  I cried all of the time and he told me I was just too emotional and needed to learn that fighting in relationships is healthy if no one is physically hurt. Or if there was no verbal abuse and then would grill me ""You don't think I'm verbally abusing you, right?"" and if I didn't give a resounding no he'd lecture me about how I'm too soft.

I totally lost all of my spark. He started telling me it was time to move in together. Really I let myself be convinced that moving in together would fix all of our problems. He got really sweet when he'd tell me he'd love to cook me breakfast everyday and go on walks. Begin our lives together. I got really scared. I kept saying yes but raising concerns. Saying I wanted to weight until we fought less or we were employed in the field we were studying to be in. He would tell me there wasn't a reason to weight.

I was a total pushover and it wasn't fair of me to give in and say yes when I wanted to say no. It was deceitful of me. Eventually it was a week before we planned to move in together and I broke down and told him I couldn't do it. I wasn't ready, I didn't want to break up, but I couldn't live with him yet. I needed more stability in my life and in our relationship.

He was really upset, which to a degree that's fair, it was such short notice. But, he told me that I was fucking with his life by quitting like this. That I was fake and I never really loved him. That people who loved each other wouldn't act like this. That I was so immature for thinking this was. He told me I had to choose right then to either live together or to break up. I told him I didn't want either of those things and he said before he hung up ""Great, well I'm telling everyone you broke us up"".

He messaged all of our friends that I was a liar and a cheater in a group chat with me in it. He then called like 10 minutes later, we argued for a bit and then he reeled me in telling me it would be fine. Nothing I'm concerned about is going to be an issue. He was so comforting. Promising me things would be so much better when we lived together. That we just fought because we were frustrated being away from each other.

I calmed down and agreed that we would move in together the next week. God sorry this is long. Anyway I broke up with him the day before we were supposed to move in together the second time over text (it's shitty and cowardly, I know. I just couldn't say the words, but that's no excuse) and I blocked him on everything. That's shitty to, I know I know but I knew that if he called me I would cave and get back with him. I was so unhappy.

I started getting dozens of calls from an unknown number. I knew it was him. He texted me several times from that number telling me I was fake and how could I do this to someone I loved. Simple, because I didn't love him (his words). It broke my heart over and over. I blocked that number too and turned off my phone for 5 days.

He made a fake linkedin account and got me there. I caved. I read the message and replied. He told me we needed to have an adult conversation about what happened. That it wasn't right to end like this. I thought I owed him that, an explanation. Long story short we got back together and I apologized for how I ended things. He told me he accepts me and my mental health issues that make me like this (even though they don't I don't think, he just says that a lot).

We've been back together like this since early February of this year. So many more fights about my tone and attitude. I'm always crying. I'm always apologizing. But god I love him. I really poured my whole soul into this man. It kills me that I'll never hear his voice, his laugh, ever again. I'm crying just at the thought. It hurts.

God writing it out makes it seem obvious that we need to break up. But sometimes, he's just so sweet and kind that I think this is really all my fault. That I'm just so broken and insecure that I've really caused all of these issues. But regardless of if it's my fault or not, I need out.

We're supposed to move in together this weekend. See my pattern? Bailing at the last minute. I'm shit, I know trust me. Please give me advice. How can I break it off for real this time. Please give me advice that's beyond just do it. I can't be the only one who gets pulled in so easily. I'm a pushover. I'm anxious. Please help. I'm posting this a few places because of the deadline. Be honest if you want. I have a lot to criticize. I know my flaws.

TL:DR: Uhh I'm a coward who keeps trying to get out of a relationship that I think is toxic and my boyfriend keeps convincing me not to and I keep giving in. (Sorry idk how to make this short)

"My mom [F40] yelled at me today for ""overreacting"" because I [F22] was worried about my pet rabbit being left in a car. Yet she also overreacts about her pet dogs. I can't bring myself to forgive her.","I would like advice on how to forgive my emotionally immature, hypocritical and unreasonable mom. 

Earlier today, my mom yelled at me in a restaurant because I was worried that my pet rabbit was left alone in a car with no air conditioning. When I went to get my bunny (a girl), my mom said she was going to be fine, but I insisted that my pet could suffocate inside of the car. She became hysterical at this and yelled she would not suffocate. She told me not to overreact but also proceeded to say ""If your pet suffocates then kill me.""

When we got to our rest house (we're on a staycation of sorts), I heard her screaming our pet dog's name (let's call him Apple) who happened to be nearby a larger dog (Peanut). Peanut wasn't even doing anything, he didn't even look aggressive and my mom was screaming as if Apple was about to die. Hearing her scream like that really pissed me off when Apple was in no way going to get hurt, but when I got understandably worried over my rabbit who was definitely at risk being left inside of a car, she got hysterical at me for ""overreacting"". 

This issue basically killed my mood for the rest of the day. I'm still mad and what's worse is that I can't even show my anger because my mom will just see it as me being a brat. 

Like many Asian parents, my mom is not someone who apologizes and rarely ever goes out of her way to understand other people's perspectives. Therefore a healthy conversation with her/expecting an apology from her is out of the table. 

The only for me to move forward is to really forgive her, but I don't know how. I would really appreciate some advice or maybe insights from anyone in a similar situation! 

Extra info about my mom (that might help you guys understand what she's like): 

- Her love language is giving gifts. She's actually quite a chill mom, she always gets me takeout, lets me sleep in late and buys me lots of stuff. I know I'm a spoiled child but that doesn't mean I can abandon the safety of my pet! While she was yelling at me she said that I was ""too privileged"" and me worrying over the safety of my pet was some kind of abuse over her generosity. 

- My mom got me the rabbit as a gift. It was an impulsive purchase and she had no idea how to take care of the bunny. I did all of the research and learned how to care for the bunny. I noticed whenever I have to ask her to do something inconvenient in any way for the sake of my rabbit's safety/wellbeing, she gets really mad. But when it's concerning our dogs it's fine with her.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/145bwzq/my_mom_f40_yelled_at_me_today_for_overreacting/,t2_19pox8rr,2023-06-10 01:50:27,1
"Help, TW: abuse","TL;DR

Hello guys, I need help or suggestions. 

I (F20) broke up months ago with my ex partner (F21) that I had a relationship with for two years, the reason I broke up with her is her uncontrollable anger issues and I felt like it is a hopeless case kasi I gave all of my patience and understanding naman but it is not enough anymore to save everything. I cannot endure being in a relationship na kinakaladkad ako sa kalsada, sinisigawan in public and worst case scenario nag e eskandalo sa kahit saan na lugar. Ang reason niya, ""Wala naman nakaka kilala sa atin, ano pakelam nila. Di naman nila tayo maaalala"". Which is the most non-sense excuse I've ever heard. Hindi ko kaya maging rehabilitation center para sa isang tao na hindi tinutulungan ang sarili (she refuses to go to a psychiatrist kahit may decent job naman siya) and the worst is, I came from an emotional abusive relationship before her and ayoko dumating ulit sa point na masisira na naman ako plus the fact na unti unti ko na a adapt toxic traits niya which is very alarming for me kasi hindi ako nag gro grow as a person with her.

Before we broke up, I told her straight up na I am not willing to save the relationship anymore but instead I am willing to be her friend pa rin kasi di ko naman matatanggi she helped me at some point in my life.

This time, I managed to move on in months with the mindset na I learned from my first relationship before her, I gave everything naman na and obviously the relationship is toxic na. We were just hurting each other, I know I am not a perfect partner din but there are things you could not pursue anymore.

Months after our break up, I met someone new and we're starting to get real close. Hanggang sa naging kami after a few more months of ligawan. The problem is, my ex has a new partner na rin but she keeps on posting up until now saying na ""I'll never forget those who left me specially YOU the one who made me believe you'll be there for me"". 

Mind you, I offered to be her friend pa rin naman kasi I could not be a partner for her anymore. I cut her off completely lang kasi nga she does not respect my new relationship, na ang dami niya parinig sa socmed na hindi ko ma gets WHAT'S THE POINT SINCE SHE HAS A PARTNER NAMAN NA.

I could not unfriend her or block her from that account since na experience ko na yung may anonymous posting sa circle of friends group namin pertaining to me, shaming my partner and I. Ang worst pa roon, may nakiki sakay pa na hindi ko rin naman kilala at all. It seems like they're all a leech sucking every chismis/entertainment na makita nila. Even my internet friends ko na sobrang ka close ko, nagulat ako sinisiraan na rin ako. 

So far, nag lay down nang onti yung pag po post niya but recently she posted nga something na related na naman sa akin. Hindi ko ma gets dahil may partner naman na siya and why would she still bother to post anything for me. 

Ang alarming din na may dummy account na nag me message sa second account ko na naka follow sa account ng kapatid ko (sa RA ko, no one knows my second account so I think it is possibly her), I tried to reply saying hi but that account deactivated immediately after seeing my reply.

What should I do guys? I blocked her from everything and deleted my second account since I don't want to have any connections with her and my so called old friends, but I am scared pa rin for my privacy and for my partner. Nakaka inis lang kasi she knows where I live kaya until now very cautious ako pag lumalabas or pumupunta kung saan saan kasi ayoko maka bunggo siya somewhere and deal with her, knowing how scandalous she is, how loud her voice was and how she drags me around. I can say na medyo may trauma pa rin sa akin yung mga kinikilos niya that's why I don't wanna see her. 

I apologize for the messy construction of my post but I just really need some opinion or suggestion. Thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/10ea7q5/help_tw_abuse/,t2_un0ytv51,2023-01-17 19:40:56,1
I (M23) Am Pretty Sure My Girlfriend (F21) Is Emotionally Cheating On Me With Her Best Friend (M22) But I Can't Confront Her About It Because She's Currently Dealing With A Lot of Career Problems - The Extended Version,"Me and my girlfriend have been together for almost five years now. It's not a perfect relationship. We've been through ups and downs. We both have our issues, we both make mistakes here and there, but at the end of the day, we still find ways to make it work.

  
One of her major issues is her tendency to ignore me for extended periods of time when she's dealing with a lot of problems or issues. 

  
***Side Note 1.1:*** She was raised in a very old school and toxic household. Her biological father left my girlfriend and her mother. As a result, she was raised in a pseudo-jail, always confined in the four corners of their home. She grew up traumatized, and one of the effects it had on her was she grew up as a bad communicator as she grew up with literally no one to talk to.

  
***Side Note 1.2:*** I called it a pseudo-jail because she cannot leave the house freely. She's 21 and cannot leave their house except to go to her classes. As a result we cannot freely go on dates, and the times we can video call are very limited as well. These are two facts I was forced to accept because I love her.

  
I knew coming before committing into this relationship that she was somehow mentally unstable. Aside from her family, she also went through an abusive relationship before me.

  
***Side Note 2:*** Her Ex-Boyfriend would only use her when she's convenient. When she's not, he would talk to other girls and cheat on her. He doesn't listen and care for her and even punches her when he feels irritated. This relationship scarred my girlfriend for life. 

  
But despite all of that, I still went ahead and pursued her because she willingly accepted me for who I am. So it became my mission to try and help her change for the better.

  
But communicating, is something she just couldn't improve upon.

  
At first, she would not message me for a couple of days, citing family problems as a reason. Even though I wanted to help her and be by her side, I understand where she was coming from. So I didn't bat an eye. But as time goes on, periods in which she would ignore me, grew longer and longer. 

  
A month in 2020. Two months in 2021 - both due to family problems that she would want to deal by herself. And the longest, eight months in 2022 - to ""fight her own demons."" There other smaller instances, but I'm not gonna add them to the total. 

  
As she continuously does this I started having mental health issues. Anxiety and panic attacks just to name a few, all because of her. I tried messaging her everyday but she won't even see my messages. But I didn't bother telling her this because I don't wanna add on to her problems.

  
In all of the instances above, it was me who tried and save the relationship. It was me who fixed everything and gave the initiative. I was not at fault, but it was me who saved everything. 

  
After that eight month ""ghosting"" that she did, things kinda went back to normal. She started communicating again, we celebrated our fourth year anniversary, the loves was back - our relationship is slowly getting better than ever before. Despite the limitations to what we can do, we made the best of every opportunity.

  
But things took a turn yet again this past March.

  
***Side Note 3:*** I haven't mentioned it yet, but hindi kami ""legal"" on her side. Her family wants her to finish her studies first before going in to a relationship. Add the abusive relationship she went through in the past, it made her family way too overprotective of her.

  
We met at a local 7/11 as I asked her to bring me some books I previously shared her before. Afraid of being seen in public by family members, she wanted me to leave immediately and not wait for her. We haven't met in a while so I wanted to stay for a while. 

So I stayed until the very end. I should have respected her word, but we rarely get to meet so I stubbornly stayed.  She got mad at me for this and ignored me yet again for almost two months. 

  
Here is where the story actually starts.

  
She didn't messaged me until late May. But I've apologized to her on multiple occasions before she decided to talk to me again. Some even say I didn't do anything wrong. 

  
But in the almost two months we've been apart, a lot has happened, a lot has changed. First, is she became really close to her colleague, a guy from the same organization. They started being close when I was out of the picture. Before they were just colleagues, but apparently they became really, really close friends while I was gone. 

  
AND APPARENTLY, THE GUY CONFFESSED HIS FEELINGS TO MY GIRLFRIEND. BUT APPARENTLY HE KNEW THAT SHE HAD A BOYFRIEND, SO HE DID NOT CONTINUE. 

  
***Side Note 4:*** I am from a Big 4 University, while she's in a university within Intramuros. 

  
I knew from the get go that things were different. She's replying was too slow now, unlike before when it was almost instantaneous. She would also send far fewer sweet messages. Before we would send sweet messages throughout the day, but when we talked again in May, that was gone. I thought she was just taking a while to come back to normal, but I soon realized that something wrong could be going on.

  
The June rolls around. Their organization got into some deep, deep problem that never thought would happen. If they couldn't fix it, their admission to that university could be in jeopardy.   
So all throughout the month, they focused on doing fixing their mistakes. And it just so happened that my girlfriend and the guy friend where in the center of the problem. So they're always together. In meetings and in doing paperwork. 

  
As a good boyfriend, I just let her do her thing. That's her passion, so I just support her. Even though sometimes she would take most of the day doing organization work, I waited patiently all the time, just like before. Never cheated, never even thought of cheating. I just waited.

  
Here's where I started being jealous and suspicious. The very limited free time she has, she spends on her guy friend. After meetings, after the paperwork, she would ask permission if they could hang out and play. I said sure go ahead. At least, she asked for permission. It gave me peace of mind.

  
But after a while, they just started hanging out and playing without my permission and knowledge. I thought she was still busy with meetings, but there they are, online in the video game, playing for hours. 

  
I confronted her about this. All I needed was validation and assurance. All she gave me was this.

  
*""Walang Meron""    ""We're Just Friends""   ""Trust Me More""* For her, this is assurance.

  
So I did. I believed in her. I trusted her. 

  
But two more instances made me question things even more. 

  
One night, at around 8:00 pm, she asked me for permission as she wanted to call her guy friend, who's mental health problems got triggered by the problems of their organization. Mental health is no joke so I said sure, go ahead. Her last message to me was at around 11:00 pm. Her next reply was at around 4:30 am. She said their call just concluded, and she was going to sleep. 

  
I was already mad at this point, but I don't wanna add on to her existing problems. So I remained calm... Until it happened again.

  
I was getting fed up, they were playing all the time. She was not inviting me. She was late on her replies. Her messages are stale. She barely says ""I Love You"" anymore. I was getting really suspicious.

  
***Side Note 5:*** My suspicions and jealousy stems from a traumatic relationship that happened six years ago. Almost the same scenario. My girlfriend at that time, cheated on me with her boy best friend. 

  
***June 15.*** I wanted to see her, so that we can talk things through. She couldn't, she was busy with paperwork. So I asked if we could call. Again, busy. She can call her friend, but not me?! Her last reply to me was at 8:00 pm. She told me she don't know what time she'll finish, so she can't promise that she can call. After that... Complete silence. No messages, no updates. Nothing. I stayed up until 3:00 am. Nothing. 

  
She replied to me, the following day, ***June 16. At 1:30 pm***. Nearly ***17 and a half hours*** so no communications. Know what she did that night? Apparently they called all night as the boy best friend had yet another mental health attack. 

  
I was angry. I couldn't control and hold my emotions anymore. You couldn't make time to call me but for him, you can?! I exploded. I demanded her to see me or at least call me. 

  
She said ***""wait, there's an emergency meeting.""***

  
I was breaking down at this point but I waited. Until 5:00 pm. When I said ""Ang tagal Naman.""   
So I checked the video game they are playing and turns out, they've been playing since 4:00 pm. Here I was, thinking she was still busy. But nope, she's having fun for an hour now with the guy she said I should not worry about.

  
I then proceed to spam her with messages and calls. She then had the audacity to get mad at me and actually ignored me for that entire night and the whole of the next day.

  
She went offline for the entirety of ***June 17.*** She wouldn't be online on anything until the midnight of ***June 18, around 12:30 am.*** She would go online on the video game, and of course, she's playing with him.

  
I spammed her again with messages until she finally replied on Messenger. I thought I would be getting an explanation, but instead all I got was invalidation and gaslighting.  She then proceeded to ignore again for the rest of that day. She claims they were only hanging out to ""cope"" with the problems of their org. She then added that I just adding to her problems and that I don't know how much she's already suffering. 

  
Pissed, mad, and disappointed that Sunday, I decided to look around, and find more clues. I saw the guy's Instagram. There, in a story highlights, was a picture of him and my girlfriend in their org room, acting all sweet and happy. She was even blushing. I dug up Facebook posts and found instances where the two were clearly interacting, and even ""flirting"" in a way. Apparently, she also shared the very same picture in her stories. 

  
The came Monday. We were supposed to have lunch that day, so I knew she was in campus. I messaged her about going and she finally replied to me, saying, no. She then claims she's going to be busy the entire day, and will have no time for me. 

So then, I messaged the friend. The guy friend also happens to be the leader of their organization. So I asked him about their lunch break. He did not reply to me, but my girlfriend did. Angrily. ""Wag mong idamay"" she said angrily. 

  
Then I asked her about the sweet photos i saw. Her reply, ""Bakit Bawal Ba?""

  
She then, yet again, ignored me for the rest of that day. We finally had a decent conversation on June 19. I told her everything, I was a bit angry at her. I was emotional, I was crying and breaking down during our call. Towards the end, I asked her four questions.

1. Does she have feelings for the guy? She said no.
2. Does the guy still have feelings for her? She claims no. But who knows really?
3. Does she still love me? She said there's a lot on her mind and can't answer right now.
4. Is she willing to rebuild and start over? She said there's a lot on her mind and can't answer right now.

  
After that, I gave her nine days to think everything through and finish the problems of their org. Those nine days were no contact days for us. She claimed that everything would be wrapped up on the 24th. But while that was happening, my girlfriend and her best friend still remained in contact.

  
They attended a leadership seminar for two days. I'm confident he was the one who took the photos my girlfriend posted on her IG. After they got home, they would continue playing all day, while they are still ""busy"" with their organization's problem.

  
The nine days have passed but they're still not finished with their problems. Apparently everything got pushed back this month so they no longer has control as to when their problem would end.   
She has yet to message me. All of my messages just went straight to her inbox. 

  
I want to confront her. Because what she is doing is emotional cheating - or even worst, it could already be micro cheating. 

  
What should I do? How should I approach this situation? I don't wanna leave her. I want to fix and work things out but I don't want to add on to her problems.

  
Any advice is highly appreciated. Thanks everyone. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/14u2pli/i_m23_am_pretty_sure_my_girlfriend_f21_is/,t2_pmon2goh,2023-07-08 20:16:20,6
"My boyfriend (18M ) is an ex porn addict, but really trying to improve himself, should I support him ?","

Hi everyone, i'm posting here cause I'm feeling like I'm being overdramatic about this situation and i clearly need a lot of differents pov

My boyfriend ( 18M ) and me ( 16F ) have been knowing each other for 6 years. I met him on internet and quickly fell in love with him. He wasn't interested by me at all, and it brokes my heart at the moment.
I knew something was off with him. Because he kept talking to my girls friends in a very sexual way. He even proposed to have sex with my girl bestfriend ( I was 13 and they were both 15.) 
He always kinda joked about it, what he liked during sex, fetisch and stuff like that. He's into really hard bdsm, and didn't hide it at all.

So I always knew sex was really important to him.
When we saw each other for the first time, I was 14 and he was 16. We had a really big intimacy, like sleeping in the same bed and he was touching me and stuff. (I was consent tbh!)
Anyway I really liked this closure since I was in love with him for 3 years now, but after that i was madly confused about our relationship. Are bestfriends supposed to act like that with each other? Before leaving my house, he grants me with a choker, saying it was my birthday gift to mark my submission to him. 
And after that we developed a BDSM-like relationship.

It was really intense for me, I wasn't used to things like that at all, but I loved him so much that I didn't manifest any form of disapproval. 
He started asking me for picks, which I was really inconfortable with but tried my best to give him what he wanted. And it felt great.
He still refused to call me his girlfriend even if we had a really close intimacy and sexual convo, he called us ""friends with benefits.""
I think he has commitment issues do to his traumas.
Anyway, that sucks.

But last October, out of nowhere, he proposed me to be his girlfriend ! I was so happy because I waited for this moment during years.
He was a very good boyfriend. Always here for me, always offering me gifts, spending time together, introduce to his family, we even celebrate Christmas together. It was really amazing, I come from a broken home and he and his family were so caring with me, it felt really nice.
Sexually it was kinda hard to me because I have been abused, and he was really understanding but when I agreed to have sexual closure with him, he asked me to do really hard things and immediately went into bdsm, even if I were only 15 at the moment.

Everything was going pretty good, but after all he did to me in the past, I was suspicious about his fidelity. So I looked up at his following.
 Hear me out, he followed ONLY naked girls, hentai content accounts, cosplayer... more than 300 accounts.
 I was shocked. Really. It hurted me so much to see that. He immediately erased all of this when I talked to him about it.
But i was still really hurt.
So I create a fake account in February.
And came to talk to him with it.
At first he didn't talk much with my fake account named Camille, he didn't even add her at first, so I was pretty confident, saying to myself I was paranoid and he would never do that to me.
 He was really cold with her since he didn't know her and is cold with everyone usually. But after a week, they start getting closer, and fast they agree that she'll be her submissive and have a sexual and emotional relationship because ""My girlfriend is too vanilla for me and can't satisfy my sexual needs"" pretending to her I will be agree ( he didn't hide the fact that he had a girlfriend).

Me reading that, I was devastated. I know it's bad to create a fake account, but I needed answers since it's the guy I want to spend my life with.
Even if I knew I wasn't perfect I tried my best to satisfy him, and his super high standards, always wearing new lingerie, always being INTEGRALY shaved..
I cried for hours not knowing what to do, and when I came to his house, took his phone, he had deleted the convo before my arrival. I confronted him, saying Camille told me everything. 
He started apologizing, saying that he loved me really and he tried to stop himself, but he think with his dick sometimes and blablabla...
I cried in his bed out of anger.
But I couldn't really blame him since I created this account to match his tastes perfectly and was REALLY provocative in my messages.
My therapist told me I trapped him into something that no man could resist...
So I started relativise and forgive him, saying to myself that after all he cheated me with myself and that will be a lesson for him not doing it again.


The relationship was still going, but very recently, after he promised to stop, I found on his tiktok following a naked girl, again.
And in his insta likes, a naked girl, he likes the post a few weeks ago.

I need to say that, he confessed to me a few weeks that he was severely addict to porn. I had doubts on it but it's the first time he openly talked about it with me. So I listened. He told me that, the day I showed him his followings and how disgusting it was, he had the revelation that it has gotten too far and that he wanted to stop for me and our relationship. He said he hasn't watched porn in months and that he was clean. I believed him, but after what I found, I don't know anymore.
All this shit hurted me so bad, he's the most precious boy ever and I love him so much but what he did... it broke me, literally. I don't feel the same since I found that about him.
I feel so empty.

But I know he made a tons of efforts, except that, he's genuinely a really loving, and caring person and that he went through a lot when he was younger, which affects his perception of things and he deals with it unhealthy. I dont want to abandon him, i want to help him since he already made good progress and I know he really want our relationship to last, but should I forgive me and be compassionate about the situation? Or should I give up ?

My(37M) partner(36F) of 15 years has completely worn me down... I'm at my breaking point... and TBH I'm terrified.,"This is my(37M) first ever reddit post... and on a throwaway account no less. TBH I didn't realize Reddit was used like this till a few Reddit Tik Tok accounts started making content posts several months ago, and between those videos and reading Reddit posts, I decided to seek some help. It will be pretty long so I'll give a summary before I bare my soul, anonymously to you all. Seeking advice, I don't know if I want to support. I have noticed that several posts I've read have mentioned this can be sort of therapeutic. So here goes. 

TL;DR I(37M) have been with my partner(36F) for 15 years. In that time we've gone through quite a bit with our relationship. Between her anxiety, an absolute fear of change, and what I hope is subconsciously sabotaging, I have reached the end of my ropes. I don't want to leave her, I have been open with this with her in terms of explaining how I feel, I've explained multiple times that what she is doing is destroying me, to no avail. Add in that there's been no sexual intimacy between us for over 7 years now... none at all. 
It hasn't all been bad, she at times has been the very thing keeping me together. Shes taken care of me when I was sick, badly injured... First time I cried in front of anyone was her. I truly do love her. Most of the time it's ok, it use to great most of the time, then good.... now we're at ok. But at best at the moment she's a roommate who I don't sleep with, don't have sex with, doesn't pay half of the bills.


Now for the full story, there are about 15 years to unpack here, I apologize in advance as this will be a rather long post, parts of which are going to be hard to read through. I'm going to include a short brief of both myself and my partner first to help keep this long post as short as possible.

- Myself:  I'm a large and tall guy, can be intimidating as I don't smile too often unless I'm with friends, despite the intimidation factor, despite that and being anti-social, I developed the ability to be a great listener, for some reason people like to come to me to vent, still to this day, although only very few can as I've pretty much just withdrawn myself from society, that will be explained in the post. I have also suffered through insomnia most of my life, which does get worse with stress. I think I also suffer from depression, at least of late. 
I am a hard worker, I love to work as it is my only real outlet mentally. You put in a hard day's work, and the negative thoughts aren't so loud. I am not religious, sort of spiritual if that makes any sense, primarily I hate conformity. I do have an extensive history of anger management problems dating back to childhood, years of anger management during my adolescent and teenage years, coupled with football, menial labor, and self-reflection, I had a really good hold on it, however over the last couple of years as I keep taking hits mentally, those holds aren't tight anymore... honestly I feel more like a ticking time bomb now than I ever have... that's the terrifying part. 
Lastly, I believe in mutual respect in any relationship whether it be with a friend or with my partner. Mutual respect includes trust, privacy, cooperation, and understanding.

- My partner: While on the shorter side, She's the life of the party. Loves to go to parties, loves to be out and about, and loves her family and friends. She's essentially the, ""If walls would talk, she'd talk to them"" type of person. Loves her pets, and if she can figure out and take care of her anxiety and fear of change, she would/will be a great mother. That last part is key as she's based her entire being on being a mother. On our third date, we had a rather frank conversation about what we wanted and did not want in our relationship. We went over fidelity, goals, wants, etc... and one thing she made clear was that she wanted children, and while I explained that I didn't want children, if this worked, I'd do what I could to make that happen. It's harder on her side. Over the years we have both put on weight, but I don't find her any less attractive. Unfortunately, that weight hasn't helped her in that department, but it's pretty much mute as we've not had any physical intimacy in a long time.
The negatives are forthcoming, and at times crippling fear of change coupled with uncontrolled anxiety that she will not seek help from a therapist, she does have medication, which she refuses to keep up with. I have spent countless hours researching ways for me to help her with it, and have spent too much money, to no avail. Lastly, there's what can only be described as laziness, which I've only now realized is laziness putting this together. 
Alright, now from the beginning. 

When we first started dating, I had roommates, despite having roommates, within the first few weeks she was spending more nights with me than her parents. Gradually moving more and more stuff over in terms of clothing and personal items. I didn't mind as I loved her being around. Call that the honeymoon phase. We went out, had adventures, decent amount of sex, etc... life was good mostly. The problem came up with her trust and respecting my stance on mutual respect. In a relationship, mutual respect to me goes as follows.
- Respect: Both public and private, talk and treat me with the same respect you expect yourself. Keep any and all hostility out of the public eye. Allow me to be a man and you a woman. If I need to protect you, I will, you can't fight against that, with there being absolutely no need to publicly berate, talk down,  or shame the other party in public. Both parts she has abused multiple times...
- Trust: If we say something, believe that it's true unless proving otherwise. No snooping, eavesdropping, 
- Privacy: What happens in our relationship and our lives together is between us. I don't talk about my private life to anyone, I don't hide her, she's on all my social media, my friends and close family knew her, met her. I just don't talk about our relationship and I expect the same in return. Instead, her immediate family knows everything about our relationship... everything, well anything that doesn't make her look bad.
- Cooperation: We're in this relationship together, we need to work together to make it work. That is physically, financially, emotionally, and mentally. If one person is doing it all, often with the partner going against it, it creates an untenable situation as I've now learned. 
- Understanding: understanding is straightforward, if one is doing something that the other doesn't like, communicate, understand where they're coming from and change what you can. Keep communication up so that you work on your shortcomings. 

Despite all of this,  I was madly in love with her, I still love her, which is why it hurts as much as it does I think... I proposed to her after a year. We initially tried planning a wedding, I even agreed to a church wedding if she wanted. She couldn't make up her mind and shot down any suggestions. To me, she's my wife, too the government we're partners. Eventually, she gave up on that, I still make suggestions, and try to give her ideas so she can have her ceremony, again to no avail.
These are all things I discussed with her when we had the baby talk. These are all things that she's both consciously and I think subconsciously gone against in one form or another. 
I'm not sure when it started, but after a few months, I noticed signs of her snooping. While we each knew each other's passwords, it was expected, at least from me, that that didn't give you the right to snoop. It goes against trusting your partner. I'd notice the ""last logged in"" time in my email would be different, something I noticed after noticing my phone in places I didn't leave it. I'd confront her and she'd deny it. I'd let it go, but a couple of days later it's happening again. At the time I worked 3 jobs, a full-time menial labor job, a bouncer/doorman for a couple of night clubs, and my side job which eventually became my full-time business. Throughout the night she'd drive by,  checking up on me, she even did it with her mother once. At first, it was cute, then when she'd deny it despite seeing her, it got annoying. She'd always give herself away when she ask me about the women who I walked to their cars on particular nights... the woman being the bottle girls and bartenders, and when they'd have a rough night or feel threatened, we'd(security) make sure they'd get to their vehicles safely. Being the doorman, while being assertive, you still have to be somewhat hospitable and friendly. Couple that with lonely women, and you will get napkins with numbers on them from heavily intoxicated women... and in a couple of instances, men. You take the number, be friendly, and send them on their way disposing of when able out of their sight. Something you don't always remember to do on busy nights. Naturally, snooping finds those very notes. And while going through both my phone and email, still found it necessary to confront me. Which would result in a fight. It got so bad with the snooping and denial that I got tired of it, I warned her that if it didn't end, I'd leave her. But she kept doing it, so I had a very close friend send me illicit messages from his girlfriend's phone which wasn't saved in my contacts. She confronted me, and I gave her the proof of the setup, packed her shit up, and broke up with her. That lasted about a week. We talked, and got together and it did get better, for a time. She doesn't snoop anymore, or she got so good at it that I haven't been able to catch her. 
Over time I found out that she was telling her mom and sister about our relationship, I think sexual info as well. Her father can't keep a secret. 
See I do love sex, I love to give orally and get orally just two problems, I don't cum quickly, and I'm not that big, not small either, big enough to offer pleasure, small enough for it to affect me subconsciously. With that in mind, I made it a priority to be able to bring a woman to climax orally in case I couldn't do so with penetration. As a result of that, I ended up loving that part and getting it. Any woman before my partner, when you made sure they were taken care of, there's a certain amount of enthusiasm you get in return both orally and then sexually. If I got them off, especially first and often again, they would make sure I would get off. This wasn't the case with my partner. I'd make sure she'd get off, often multiple times, and while at first, she would try, she'd give up quickly. To the point of having to take care of myself by myself. I'd get excuses that I took too long, too eventually that sex hurt for her, mind you again I'm not that big, and I'm not ignorant to mood or lubrication. But she would never turn away getting oral. As time went on, as I got more and more no's and more and more excuses, I guess I just stopped asking... I also stopped giving. We haven't had sex since at least 2016... haven't been intimate at all sexually since 2019. Please don't think I haven't tried to change the situation. I've tried exploring with toys to no avail, talking about it which falls on deaf ears, too talking about an open relationship which she categorically turns down and refuses. Yet her family knows my size and how I feel about it, as well as my inability to ""cum fast""... sex is a huge part of a relationship... having a partner who doesn't view you the same way you view her sexually has broken me a few times...

But if she doesn't like to have sex, what about her desire to be a mother? When we tried having a baby the first couple of years, sex wasn't that bad and after a few attempts, she went to a doctor. We tried the medication, vacation, to invetro... single handily the most embarrassing situation I've ever been in was in that room... but it was for her and what she wanted and I did everything I could... till she gave that up too. During that whole time, her sister got married and while having the same hardships getting pregnant, is now pregnant and giving birth soon. 

The last part and possibly longest part is her inability to deal with her anxiety and fear of change. And believe me, in this instance they're not the same thing. While her fear of change can trigger her anxiety, her anxiety is caused by something else. Over the years as it's gotten worse, I've spent so many hours getting to help her. From researching about it, to how to help her when she has attacked, to items that can help her cope. From weighted blankets to edibles, and everything in between. She refuses every attempt at help.  She refuses to talk to a professional and refuses to take the medication prescribed by her doctor. The fear of change is so bad that you can't even plan for the future. After years at my menial labor job, I wanted to take my business and go full-time with it. While planning it, and getting arrangements in place, she and her mother would try and sabotage it. Mainly mentally. How can you say you support someone or believe in them, to turn around and say that what they want to do won't work, it's not worth the risk. This would result in fights,  which got so bad that I had to give her the ultimatum, get on board or leave. She chose to stay, and while she didn't talk against it, she also didn't help with getting it set up. When I finally made the change it was another fight.  Which hasn't stopped. When it's bad, and there's been a lot of bad times, especially during covid, and whenever I toss ideas at her for her opinion, it's a negative. Again this is something I talk to her about, and it never changes. I started my business almost 10 years ago, and it's still open. When it comes to what is next or what I want to do, I can't go into too much detail as it may cement an ID of who I am to anyone who is reading this and know me. Let's just say I long for a life of self-prosperity for both myself and my friends free of societal dependency. Something that requires a lot of planning... something that is also heavily fought back against. While I get the ""that's a good idea"", there's no dialogue. There's no give when any sacrifice is proposed. This goal requires a couple of years of discipline and sacrifice to achieve, one that she refused till she had no choice. Just after COVID, the apartment we had rented for almost 10 years was sold to a new owner who wanted to move in. The move I had been trying to do since 2019 was to give up the apartment and move into my business location for 1 to 2 years, and with the money we save, we can pay cash for the next part and not rely on a loan, another thing that was fought against. My business location is located in an industrial building of trades mixed with a doctor's office and a gym. My unit itself takes up well over 2k sqft,  with a bathroom,  shower, and small ""kitchen"", of which not even half the space is being used by my business. While it's not in my lease that you can't do what I wanted, it's also not something I believe they would approve of. Well when the apartment building sold, it was the perfect solution. Why spend all that money on high rent, first last deposit when we can move and consolidate? Even with eviction, she still fought me. To the point, I took my stuff, or everything but her clothes to the shop and said she could go to her parents, only after this did she finally get on board. Set up our living arrangements in a part of my unit that doesn't have anyone near it most of the time. You can't see into my unit, but there's a part of my unit that is wedged between the offices of a trades business on one side and the offices of a gym on the other. Loud sounds make their way through the walls in those parts rather easily. In that part, I have had a few recliners set up for the last few years comfortable recliners. As I don't think the owners would approve, no one knows we moved into my unit. However, my partner snores very loud, and so do I, however, with my sleep mask I don't. She doesn't wear one so her snoring is full blast. This is why I set up the living arrangements where I did.  However, she likes to fall asleep on one of those recliners, which wouldn't be an issue if she slept at night. But she purposely stays awake till 4 am most nights and sleeps well into the afternoon. I keep making her aware of this, to the point that I've had a couple of meltdowns over the last year. She knows that I know it's being done intentionally, after each fight she doesn't do it for a day or two and then goes right back to doing it. She was laid off about 2 months ago, and her behavior of staying up all night didn't help. The money that was saved up is rapidly dwindling. She isn't looking for work and isn't trying to change her behavior, and now without a job she sleeps all day, and stays up all night. If we're caught here and evicted, I lose my business. I lose my business I don't know what I'll do.  Now it's affecting me, to the point it's hard to get out of bed every day. Depression has been hitting me harder and harder as I see no way out. I'm constantly angry, I'm always on edge, and she doesn't care. Not that I ever expected or asked for, now that I think of it,  there's never been an ""I'm proud of you"", ""good job"", or thank you for what you do for us from her, instead I get what feels like constant negativity and doubt.80+ hour weeks to support us between multiple jobs when she barely worked, to trying to set up our future... I want(ed) to spend the rest of my life with this woman, but as I've been writing this all out and reflecting, I don't think she's ever loved or respected me... as I keep hitting walls and I fall deeper, the negative thoughts get louder. They've always been there, but these last few months they're so loud... some days they're deafening. I don't know what to say... I guess I don't need advice, rereading this the answer is obvious... but it's not easy. I don't think I can, but I'm afraid of what happens to me if I don't...

If you're still with me here, thank you for reading. I've tried to make sure all of the Grammer is right. I don't know how to end this... let me know your thoughts.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/10hvb1t/my37m_partner36f_of_15_years_has_completely_worn/,t2_vn7rghn6,2023-01-22 00:38:33,6
