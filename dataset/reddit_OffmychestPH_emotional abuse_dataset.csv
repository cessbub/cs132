Emotionally Abused,"ngayon ko lang nalaman na form ng emotional abused inabot ko sa mga taong tinuring kong pamilya. i always say na magkaroon nang maayos na communication but palagi silang passive-agressive every time they have a problem with me. cold and silent treatment din natatanggap ko kapag may problema sila na wala naman akong kinalaman. naging punching bag ako and source nila ng aruga. they drained the fuck out of me. at nang sumabog ako, they made me feel like ako ang mali. i'm just glad internship na at di ko na sila makakasama. nakakasuka. nakakasawa magtiwala.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/19912q9/emotionally_abused/,t2_f4ixiymq,2024-01-18 00:45:10,2,0
Good bye mr. Emotionally abusive guy,"Ended my situationship with an older guy a while ago because i couldnt take the disrespect anymore. 

Pag talaga nagagalit ang ibang tao, dun mo sila mas nakikilala. The way they let out their frustrations, the reasons why theyre frustrated, and how they treat people ariund them when theyre frustrated, these things matter and will show eventually. 

I told him ive been surrounded by family members who seem to have anger issues but it turns out ganun din pala siya. It scared me when he became mad out of nowhere and how invalidated my emotions. It was obvious how he tried to manipulate and confuse me into thinking na may nagawa nga akong mali. He also refused to communicate.  He would just say na forget about what happened without even saying sorry of fully talking about what just transpired.

He even tried to threaten me na ibblock ako nung inopen ko ulit yung problem na yun. That moment was my turning point already. Ive realized that time how he’s trying to impose his control over me and our situation. How fucked up he is. I lost all my genuine feelings for him at napalitan ng pure hatred.

Kanina lang, i decided to leave and block him. Good riddance.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/18rcpiv/good_bye_mr_emotionally_abusive_guy/,t2_hf0d4ej40,2023-12-27 01:05:46,12,2
so tired of the emotional abuse at home,"My mom and I haven’t talked since Tuesday. She has been giving the silent treatment because I put my hands to face like [this](https://www.dreamstime.com/stock-image-man-put-his-hands-face-image24096821) and she thinks it’s because of her. 

Pero nung araw na yun, I had a big presentation for my supervisor, I had b2b client meetings, my psychiatrist cancelled the day before, and I had an upcoming talk which I hadn’t prepared for. 

She asked me “ano ba problema mo?” in an angry tone and I told her it was because of stress. She reacted angrily kasi akala niya it was because of her. How am I supposed to open up if she doesn’t listen and galit agad kapag magreact? Now she hasn’t talked to me in 5 days.

I honestly am not affected by the silence and ignorance. It’s more of the emotional abuse from a narcissistic parent na matagal ko nang tinitiis since I entered school. It’s tiring and I want to move out. I live with a nmom and an enabler, cheating dad. You can check my profile, I have a lot of stories there. Ang hirap nilang pakisamahan :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/12urkfj/so_tired_of_the_emotional_abuse_at_home/,t2_c6uh1mzu,2023-04-22 10:25:27,1,5
Na survive ko ang physical at emotional abuse today,"3 sampal at katakot takot na threats dahil sa walang humpay na pag iyak ko, sampalin ka ba naman eh. 

Para akong mababaliw kanina, hinihila, sinisiko, pinipilit mag salita, tinutulak. Para akong pinalong aso sa pag iyak  na naka suksok sa sulok tas pag hinahawakan lalong lumalakas ang iyak dahil nakakatakot na bawat hawak sayo may hagupit na kapalit. 

Hindi ko akalain na magagawa sakin ng SO (now ex) ko to. First time kong masaktan sa relationship at trauma is real. Dahil lang sa di ko masunod ang gusto nya kahit at risk ang health ko. 

Tinapos ko na at sana huling encounter na namin sa isa't Isa. Naiiyak ako pag naiisip ko yung ginawa nya. Mahal nya daw ako pero bakit ganun? Pag mamahal pa ba yun kung ganoon?

Namatay na yung tita ko who physically & emotionally abused me & my sister nung highschool kami pero wala akong naramdaman nung nawala sya.,"Napatawad ko na sya. Nakahingi pa nga sya ng tawad 2 months bago sya namatay. Sabi ko, wala na yun tita. Kalimutan mo na yun.  Totoong napatawad ko na sya pero traumatized pa rin ako pag may mga bagay na nakakapang trigger sa akin ng mga bad memories na iyon.

Unexpected ang death nya. Nasa Canada na ko ngayon. Nung nabalitaan ko yon, iyak ng iyak mama ko. Pero ako, wala. Blanko lang. Of course hindi ako masaya sa nangyari pero hindi rin naman ako nalungkot at naapektuhan.

I feel bad for feeling this way.

7 years din kaming nasa puder nya. May mga good memories naman pero bilang lang. Pag lang naka mood sya pag may pera sya that time. Pag wala, ayun, Princess Sarah at Ms. Minchin na ang atake.

Hindi ko masabi to sa mama ko kasi alam kong masasaktan sya. Kapatid nya yun at mahal nya. Kahit may nagawang ganun ang tita ko, sobrang buti ng mama ko at pinatawad nya.

Sabi ng mama kahit ano raw nagawang masama sa amin, wag na wag daw kaming hihiling ng ikakasama ng iba.

Gusto ko lang din sabihin na proud ako na sya ang mama ko. <3",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/19987qx/namatay_na_yung_tita_ko_who_physically/,t2_knsfqyyap,2024-01-18 05:24:41,282,0
Finally got out of a toxic and emotionally abusive relationship!,"I did it! I ended it, kahit mahirap.

So many chances, so much forgiveness, understanding, at love ang binigay ko, kaso this time narealize ko ang self-worth ko. I realized that this time ay respetuhin ko naman ang sarili ko. I had already set boundaries with him but he continually breaks them. Hindi naman siya ganito dati, but I don't know what happened kung bakit siya nagbago.

I wanted for us to communicate and resolve our misunderstandings in a calm and loving manner. Ilang beses na siya nagpromise na aayusin niya yun. Naniwala ako sa kanya dahil pagkaresolve kasi namin ng issue, sobrang sweet at lambing. Pero kapag in times na may problema, sobra sobra magalit.

Di ako makaalis dahil nagccling pa ako sa hope na baka bumalik naman yung maayos na trato niya sakin from years ago. Pero wala talaga. Pinipiling makipagbreak instead na makipagcommunicate. Lagi nalang ako napagbubuntungan ng anger issues to the point na sinisigawan, pinagmumura, at ginagaslight ako.

I know I wasn't perfect sa relationship namin at may mga pagkukulang din ako. Pero, hindi yun free pass para pagmumurahin na ako. Yun na yung naging last straw para sa'kin.

It was clear that the man I used to love wasn't there anymore. I hope he's okay and safe though, and that he gets the help that he needs. But for now, we're not meant for each other and maybe it's better that way.

If you're stuck in a toxic relationship now, just know that there's still hope out of this seemingly endless tunnel and I hope that the time will come when you could muster up the courage to get out of it.

My employer let people get away with emotionally abusing me at work because they conveniently blamed my mental struggles,"Full disclosure I truly did suffer depression because of previous incident at work.

I worked with someone who I worked with for years and I trusted. A new person then got added to the team. At first things were fine but they started to exclude me and refused to work with me whenever we worked together in the same shift.

I tried to fix the dynamic by asking what I did wrong but I was told there wasn't anything wrong and they weren't excluding me even though it was pretty clear they were. They even gaslit my wife telling her she didn't understand because she's not working at the same company even though I tell her everything.

I ended my friendship with the person I worked for years and my bosses today, while supportive and gave me very favored plans moving forward it is a shame that they believed the culprits in them saying it's ""all in my head"" and my reaction was due to my mental struggles.

Remember kids, do not let anyone you do not trust know that you are dealing with mental struggles. They will use it against you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1671mhi/my_employer_let_people_get_away_with_emotionally/,t2_daxg1,2023-09-01 16:46:18,2,0
"I just realized that my emotionally abusive, 5 year ex-girlfriend may have cheated on me and her family supported it?","I feel like complete shit and in a span of 20 minutes yung self-image and self-worth ko has become so distorted and I don't really know what to do with myself. Honor roll ako na IT student, and Vice president in training para sa Esports organization ng University namin. I try to really put a lot of time and effort into my studies, because I want a better life for myself and for my parents and I want to make them proud. The usual stuff.  

Naiintindihan ko na baka na kulangan na ako ng oras sayo, kasi sobrang busy ko na, pero parang grabe naman yung cheating na supported ng pamilya mo. I feel so fucking sad and confused, kasi I have always tried my best to make you feel loved in various ways, because you've always been someone who has needed constant reassurance. I built and performed occasional upgrades and maintenance on your pc, kumakain tayo sa labas, nag tiles, pintura, semento pa ako and various other stuff sa bahay niyo, we would video call every night too, I would try my best to get along with your family even though I'm not a social person. I can't even enumerate enough how much I've sacrificed for you. 

Siguro kasalanan ko din. Sobrang lenient ko din kasi sayo ee. Alam kong nahihirapan kang makahanap ng mga kaibigan kaya nung may mga naging kasundo ka naging sobrang maluwag ko. May nanglandi daw sakanya, and because  I had so much trust in her I just took her word for it when she said that she just brushed it off. Tinuturuan daw pala kasi siya mag billiards hahaha tapos inoofferan ihatid, pumupunta pa siya sa concert nung guy pero ok lang sakin kasi kasama niya daw friends niya and I thought it was a good opportunity to build friendships, in between those ang dami pa nilang inuman kasama siya and instances ng gala nila na hindi din siguro ako aware. Kaya pala ang dalas mo manood ng basketball intrams hahaha tapos makikita ko nung hiwalay na tayo may picture ka pa kasama siya.

Birthday ng mommy niya the other day and they posted a picture of the guy having dinner with the whole family. I broke up with her, because she became so emotionally unbearable and controlling. Its barely been a month and I don't think you would introduce a guy that fast after your 5 year relationship just ended?, unless they've known about it beforehand and even then how would they even be remotely fine with something like that. I honestly would have been fine, if we just grew apart or for some other reason that's normal, pero grabe yung ganito. It feels different when you think that the whole relationship went to shit in the first place, because she was already eyeing somebody else. 

It breaks my fucking heart, because I was insecure about the guy in the first place, pero I put in blind fucking trust, because I believe a relationship's foundation should be built on that. I can't even afford to be fucking sad right now kasi mag eexam na kami, I have deadlines, and may upcoming big event yung organization. I can't breathe properly and I feel like I'm gonna fall apart   
Ang bigat ng puso ko. I've been meditating, smoking, studying, and coding for hours to try and cope, but I don't think its enough. Any inspirational quote, insight, or ways to cope would be greatly appreciated po.

0.3 lang yan. Never mong malalabas yan! My (M30) longterm GF (F30) ay may requirement na 1.0c Engagement Ring bago sya mag-Yes!,"0.3 nga lang yan. Never mo ng ilalabas yan!  
This is her exact words. Nagkaroon kami ng argument kagabi ng gf ko last night at umabot sa sumbatat bakit hindi padin ako nag ppropose sakanya kahit lahat ng kaibigan at kakilala nya ay either kasal or engaged na.   
Last Feb, bumili ako ng 0.3c Engagement Ring with GIA Cert. sa isang kilalang shop sa Quiapo na umabot ng PHP40k. Balak ko sana mag-propose sa araw ng birthday ko pero somehow ay sinabihan nya ako pabiro before ng birthday ko ay wag ako mag ppropose kase nasa bahay lang kami at walang design akong dala for proposal. After ng birthday ko, dito na nag simula na mag sabi na gusto nya na 1.0c na engagement ring, palagi nya sakin to sinasabi in random ocassions at sinasabi nya din na wag ako mag propose kung 0.3 lang balak kong ibigay sakanya. Dahil din dito bakit nadelay at parang nawalan ako ng gana na mag-propose sa ngayon.  
Last July, kinasal yung kaibigan nya sa Zambales at kailangan mag-stay sa isang resort. Dito ko sya kinausap tungkol sa mga hirit nya regarding proposal and ring size. Inexplain ko din na para sakin ang meaning ng proposal ay ung commitment namin sa isa't isa regardless sa ring size. Feeling ko kase gusto nya lang ipakita sa ibang tao ung ring size na natanggap nya kesa  yung actual commitment namin sa isa't isa.  
Early this morning, sinabi nya sakin na wag na ako mag-ppropose kung 0.3c lang kaya kong ibigay sakanya. Nasaktan ako. Kase, indirectly na sya na-""NO"" sa proposal ko knowing na nakabili na ako. Hindi ko na alam gagawin. Wala na din akong gana mag-propose pa sakanya. Hindi lang din sa kadahilan na to. Dahil din sa way ng pag-trato nya sakin. Nanghihinayang lang ako makipag hiwalay ulit kase binalikan ko sya last 2020. Ginawa ko naman lahat. Pero bumalik ulit kami sa toxic relationship.  Balik ulit sa verbal and emotional abuse.   
Di ko na alam. Gusto ko nalang ulit makipaghiwalay.

Lahat nlng “gaslighting.” Pwede namang “persuade” o “convince”,"Rinding-rindi na ako. 

A lot of times I see people saying they gaslit themselves into /xyz/ when really, they just convinced themselves into doing it. 

Please, lahat nlng talaga.

Gaslighting is abuse. It should not be taken lightly and thrown around so loosely. 

Ano yung totoong pag-gaslight sa sarili? 

Gaslighting yourself that it wasn’t rape kasi magjowa kayo. 

Gaslighting yourself into thinking na deserve mo yung abuse na nakukuha sa parents mo kasi sila naman nagpalaki sayo. 

Gaslighting yourself is excusing someone’s bad behavior kasi “they’ve always been like that” or “it’s okay, we’re close naman.”

Gaslight din yung pag-iisip na may mali sayo when in fact you just need rest kasi you’re juggling too many things at once but you keep denying that.

Hngggh!!!

I know some of them are satire pero it’s making my brain itch!

You didn’t gaslight yourself into cleaning your room. 

Please. That’s a win! That’s not abuse. 

And also, while we’re at it, sharing your stories of trauma with each other is not trauma bonding. A trauma bond is the emotional attachment you get/develop for your abuser. 

Did you know na may mga nai-inlove sa kidnappers nila dahil binibigyan sila ng meal once a day?  That’s trauma bond.

Living with my abuser.,"#Trigger warning 
#I need help. 

#I married a monster.

Long post ahead. Please bare with me.  

I consider myself as a single mom of many kids. 

Isipin niyo na lahat ng word na pwede niyo ikabit sa word na abused. Ako yun. 

Sinasaktan niya ako if I refuse to have sex with him. Ang sabi niya “responsibilidad” ko daw yun bilang asawa. NO THAT’S MARITAL RAPE kako. Meron pang isang bagay na gustong gusto niya ginagawa pero di ko na masasabi kasi it will be a give away. (Sexual and physical abuse). 
He cheated on me and I had STD not once, not twice… I told him that it’s actually ground for annulment. Feeling ko ang dumi dumi ko. 

Ilan taon na ako lang ang bumuhay sa pamilya namin. (Economic abuse) 

Gina-gaslight niya ako and he used emotional manipulation. He one time said he’d kill himself dahil ayaw kong makipag sex sa kanya.  (Emotional abuse). 

To name a few. 

Ilang beses na akong nag attempt na makipag hiwalay sa kanya, but he knows I have a forgiving heart. Pero lahat my limit. Nauubos din tayo. 

We moved to a different city to start a new life. Ang alam ng mga friends ko hiwalay na kami. Which is partly true. Di ko lang sinabi na nagkabalikan kami kasi I used it as an excuse (not my proudest moment) I don’t like telling lies. Siguro napapansin nila na di ko sinasagot yung mga tanong nila. Para di na ako mag lie pa. 

It was so bad na umabot ako sa point that I almost kill myself. 2 tao lang nakakaalam nito. 

Few years ago he throw a fit kasi ayaw kong makipag sex sa kanya. I was so tired galing sa work tapos ako pa naglinis ng house. He was jobless. Pag di nagwo-work yung pagwawala niya he resorts to verbal abuse towards my kids. Hindi ko kinaya. I begged him to kill me para matapos na lahat ng paghihirap ko. Few months after that nagtino. So kala ko ok na. Nope. Nagkawork lang siya pero ganun pa din. Masaya kaming lahat sa bahay pag wala siya. Tahimik ang mundo. 

Couple of years ago I decided na ayaw ko na talaga. I told him to move out. But he didn’t. But for me hiwalay na kami. Pinaalis ko siya sa room. No physical contact di ko kinakausap nakablock sa lahat. I decided to take care of myself again. Nag message siya bigla using a different number, asking for sex. Like WTF! Seryoso? He began stalking my accounts. Called me a slut at may lalake daw ako. 

Last year he beat the shit out of me. Nag pa blotter ako, VAWC, pati sa Barangay. Walang nangyari. Sabi aalis na siya ng bahay pero nandito pa din. He threatens to kill me harm my family and friends at work. 

Madami siya kilala na influential na tao.

Childhood trauma affect adult relationships ,"I've known it all my life that I haven't healed from my childhood trauma. I just thought that since di ko na iniisip childhood ko, wala na siya.

I realized why I continued and stayed with my abusive ex. It was because the abuse was a familiar wound. It was a situation I've been in before but with my primary male caregiver which is my father.

My father and I lived alone in the province while my mom worked here in Manila. My father would physically abuse me and verbally abuse me whenever I failed my quizzes, my exams, I get a lower ranking at school. (Nothing sexual ok)

I would always go to school with bruises underneath my uniform. My aunts and cousins knew but whenever they would make sumbong kay lola and it would reach my father, he'd beat me some more. After the beating, he would then hug me and wipe my tears and tell me he wouldn't beat me if he didn't love me and that this was tough love. He said, it's not love if I don't get hurt because I needed to learn.

Anyway, I guess that's why despite the blatant verbal and emotional abuse by my ex, I still stayed.  Because after he hurts me, he also comforts me afterwards and tells me that it's tough love and I need to be stronger.

I both loved men who hurt me because they said they love me.

Wala I guess, it just makes sense.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1c3wrl9/childhood_trauma_affect_adult_relationships/,t2_ogu7uvki,2024-04-14 23:54:36,5,1

"My co-parent is a huge fucking piece of shit, and it took me three years to fully realize it.","Before I got into a relationship with my co-parent, I dated two other men who cheated on me and physically abused me. Though he didn't cheat on me, we still didn't work out because of his retroactive jealousy issues (my body count was a little higher than his), which then made him verbally abusive towards me. The emotional abuse got so bad that I resorted to self-harm, and all of this happened to me while I was in my first trimester of pregnancy. He also treated me like shit for getting pregnant and encouraged me to abort my son many times because it's bad for his career (as if he had any lol), and went as far as accusing me of making pikot because he comes from a political dynasty. After our failed engagement, I stayed away from dating because his words really cut deep, and I have completely lost my confidence in putting myself out there. During this time, I kept on blaming myself for all the shit he put me through, thinking that I deserved it because I chose to keep our son. I even told all my friends that he was the best partner I've ever had because unlike the others, he didn't cheat or physically harm me.

Thinking about it now, it was so fucking disgusting of me to rationalize what he did. I was a 22 year old girl then who was lost and suddenly plunged into parenthood, and instead of being kinder, he put me through so much. He shouted at me a lot in my own house, then called off our engagement on the sole reason that his brods think I'm a gold digger (idk where this came from bc he was basically unemployed for three months and I shouldered all his expenses then).

I got extra triggered today because he visited my home to meet my son, and he had the audacity to tell me I was not a good person. What a fucking piece of shit, I solely took care of my son for the past three years we were separated whilst he was busy chasing empty career promises of his brods. While he's sleeping sound, I was up taking care of my son then heading to work without sleep for 3 fucking years. Tapos ako pa yung hindi good person? Hahaha putang ina mo, T***. I hope you get what's coming to you, gago ka. Matapos ko lang 'tong masters ko, gago tatanggalin na talaga kita sa buhay namin ng anak ko.

I think what further solidified my long overdue anger is that I currently have a suitor now who is exerting so much effort for me, and is treating me so well. Despite his demanding schdule at work and in grad school, he visits me in a heartbeat when I need emotional support. Whatever free time he has, whether it be an hour or a day, he does his best to allot most of it for me. He treated me to nice dinners for no reason aside missing me. He really showed me that all my life, I settled for the bare minimum. Salamat na lang at hindi na ulit mangyayari 'yon, because I finally know what it's like to be loved. Whether we work out or not, I'm glad to have finally known my worth.

So TL;DR version: Tangina ng ex kong verbally abusive pati brods nyang makakapal ang mukha, and also that abuse isn't always cheating or physically beating. Often, it comes in the form of verbal and emotional abuse. Eitherway, we shouldn't settle for any when there are billions of people who are willing to give us so much more love.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1azyi8l/my_coparent_is_a_huge_fucking_piece_of_shit_and/,t2_ulxerfe3z,2024-02-26 04:49:00,8,0

my lola's friend caused someone's death.,"pa rant kasi parang ang hirap i-sink in yung mga nangyari. Mahaba 'to kaya please bear with me (pati na rin grammar ko, kasi indi ako magaling mag tagalog because I'm from Visayas)

So my Lola, (a teacher, retiring next year, and kapatid ng mismong Lola ko) has a friend which is a principal teacher sa isang public school dito samin. I met her many times before — sa mga parties and dinner with subject teachers. Okay naman siya. She's nice and has good communication skills. I prefer her over sa 'bestfriend' ng lola ko na mala karen ang attitude.

Not until I heard sa radyo (2 days ago) na there's a maid. A 19 years old, who committed suicide. And I was shocked nung narinig ko name ng amo niya. It was my lola's friend.. the principal teacher. I thought nagkamali lang ako ng rinig.. but it was really her.

The girl committed suicide because she wanted to attend college but eto naman si misis principal.. she said awful things to her simply because she doesn't want the girl na mag-aral and umalis. She even threatened the girl na sisirain niya yung card niya in front of her and she will call the police to accuse her of things na nawawala sa bahay if talagang aalis siya.

And you know what's worse?

She cursed the victim, saying awful words directly at her na she will always be a maid and graduating college doesn't suit her, dahil belong daw siya sa bundok where her parents work as magsasaka.

I was stunned to hear this and akala ko baka gawa gawa lang ng mga witness but there's a video of it. A fucking video of them talking. I don't know kung nasan yung video but I heard sa radyo na they watched it— and they were so mad at the principal teacher for causing someone's death. Not because of physical abuse, but mentally, and emotional abuse.

At eto pa ha, her salary every month is 3k lang?? and yung cheap rice pa yung pinapakain sakanya. Minsan saging lang. Tapos sometimes she's asked to iron the clothes daw ng amo niya every 12AM-1AM like what the fuck? The principal teacher is fucking rich. Her husband and daughter are fucking lawyers yet ganyan yung trato sakanya?! how inhumane!!

The girl opened up to her boyfriend and messaged him na she will end things as she don't see any future na daw because of what misis principal told her. Her boyfriend rushed doon sa bahay where she's working. Her boyfriend found her hanging but she was still alive..

However, she didn't make it. When she was at the hospital, she was choking na daw which caused her death..


I don't know what and how to react.. but damn this is just so..

Hay, rest in peace.. shit the victim didn't deserve that : (((

Nakakalungkot talaga and I feel so sad sa nangyari. Sobrang naiinis ako kasi I used to admire this principal yet to know na eto yung nangyari? Gosh, she did not only kill the girl.. but the victim's dreams na maging isang ganap na teacher din and for her family.

Potangina talaga. I hope the family will get the justice they deserve : ((


EDIT: I apologized for using the word 'owner' instead of 'amo' pasensya na po talaga and thank you so much for the correction...

Pagod na ako,"I've never been a rebel in all my life unlike my siblings who aren't afraid to speak their minds. I'm so tired na gusto ko na mawala sa mundo. Si mama grabe na yung emotional abuse haha. All my life I tried my best to be a good daughter and do whatever she asked me to. I even chose na mag premed kasi gusto nya mag doctor ako, and im the type to even give up my dreams, just to make my parents happy. Pero grabe na talaga haha Whenever something goes wrong, ako yung sasalo ng galit palagi. My siblings aren't afraid na sumagot kay mama pero ako tahimik lang. Sana ako rin kaya kong sumagot haha, puro nalang kasi tatanggapin ko nalang para matapos na agad kahit sila pa yung mali. I'm already stressed as within my own life tapos ang emotionally draining and painful pa sa bahay. Minsan gusto ko nalang magbyebye sa earth pero i always think na there are more hopeful days to look forward to. Ang sakit lang kasi i dont have anyone for emotional support that I'm mgoing through, not even my family. I know my family mean well pero grabe minsan ang hirap nyong mahalin.

"""m*m*tay pa ba ako kapag uminom ako ng 10 sodium ascorbate"" my friend asked me","Natrigger ako nung tinanong niya yan saakin. Gusto ko lang ito ilabas kasi hindi ko kayang makuwento sa iba. 

For context, nagka breakdown siya sa call because of a personal problem. I told her I will support her the best I can and when I am able. Those were my specific words. Sabi ko pa sa kaniya na ilabas niya lang pag-iyak niya at kung anong comfortable i-share para sa kaniya. Pero grabe na talaga, nagstart na ako ma anxious nung tinanong niya yan saakin. 

Few months ago, I had just set myself free from an emotionally abusive relationship, at halos ganiyan palagi mga sinasabi ng ex ko kapag nagb breakdown siya. I get na things can get really tough pero SOBRANG bigat sa konsensiya ko yan. I know that my friend knows na natataranta ako kapag nagiging su*cidal na ang ex ko noon, but maybe she forgot lang and that's quite expected na rin since months na naglipas. 

So, I did my best and stood my ground, and told her, 

""I am not fit to engage in conversations right now na kasi natrigger ako. i am sorry kung natrigger ako pero i know i have to withdraw muna kasi i have to take care of my (mental) health rin, but that does not make it your fault.""

Nagreply siya ""no need to come back"" daw. Duon ako nainis. Ano na gagawin ko p0t@ngina",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/17y7ohy/mmtay_pa_ba_ako_kapag_uminom_ako_ng_10_sodium/,t2_cn1xp5rnx,2023-11-18 22:31:51,154,54

"Worked Incredibly Hard, Only to Lose Everything and be Called a Failure.","Already in my 30s, single, with a medical condition that needs monitoring, and soon will lose my job and business, and will be left with loans… And to top all of that, was told by my partner that they regret doing business with me because it was a failure.

I was called a failure because according to them, I let my emotions get the best of me… I was called a failure because basically, I didn’t have as much money as them to save the business… They blamed it on my materialism. 

At the same time, I am also repeatedly described as a slut by my ex (just broke up) for speaking to people online for a few days when I was lonely, when I was physically abused, when I was emotionally abused by ex…

I worked so incredibly hard… I guess they don’t really know because I don’t really tell them. I just work. The business was doing great in its first year. Second year, not so… I continued to work incredibly hard to save it on the second year but my partner wants out. 

Off my chest because… I am all over the place already… I just want to kill myself already. That’s how fatigued I am already… To work so hard and fail… To be at this age and still be nothing… As said by other people… I just worked so hard and for it to just… Crumble in front me… I am so traumatized to start on my own and handle a new business again… I am so traumatized to trust people and find love again… I am so traumatized to believe in myself again…",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1biawvv/worked_incredibly_hard_only_to_lose_everything/,t2_t3k4rk8r4,2024-03-19 11:39:49,0,1
Sudden thought of leaving my bf of 5 years,"OFF MY CHEST, bahala na kayo ano sasabihin nyo sakin o i wish nyo ko mauntog. 

We met 201- , senior high school. Best friends kami until 201-, nung nagka inlaban haha. (We were teens that time, 20’s na kami ngayon: M/F couple) Until now going strong. If you will know our story, ang solid ng foundation ng relasyon namin, legal on both sides up to the very extended families (ex. 2nd cousins and farther), have a close circle of friends, and super compatible ng ugali namin. 

But there’s one thing i cannot take, he’s very emotionally/verbally abusive. He call me names/below the belt insults, name it. Pag galit sya o inis sya sakin. Actually nag lessen na ngayong tumatanda na kami, dati? I call s*icide hotline almost every night crying dahil sa mga words nya. Umabot na din kami sa physical abuse years ago. He’s hurting me every time galit sya. 

Now, wala nang physical abuse, nag lessen na ang verbal abuse. But nung nag away kami and pinag mumura nanaman ako. Di kami nag usap for a while, nag chat sya and all caps mura ang chat tas wala na ulit. All of a sudden I wanted to leave him. There’s something holding me back, baka impulsive move lang. pero grabe yung urge ko ngayon. 

Hindi ko na alam. If tatanungin nyo ko kung mahal ko sya, oo. Pero grabe gusto ko na syang iwan. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1c0k74p/sudden_thought_of_leaving_my_bf_of_5_years/,t2_onvht66od,2024-04-10 20:19:45,13,22
What if ibalik ko sa mama ko lahat ng pinaggagawa niya? Kaso...,"From Physical abuse down to emotional abuse sama mo na verbal abuse. Gusto ko siyang bugbugin pabalik, tawaging ""walang kwentang tao"" at paiyakin ng buong araw para naman maranasan niya lahat ng naranasan ko sa kanya bilang ina niya. For past 24 years, sobra sobra na ang pananakit niya sakin even for a minor mistake grabe na siyang manigaw tas sinapak ka pa. Naalala ko noong pinaliwanag ko sa kanya bakit naging 87 ang grade ko kaso bigla nalang ako sinampal at nagalit siya nung nacorner siya ng teacher ko.

Kaso dumating lang ang pandemic. Doon ko nalaman bakit ganyan siya.

Back in 1963, siya ang trial child nila lolo at lola dahil siya ang unang anak na babae sa pamilya. Dala ng religion nila, ang dami nang pinagbabawal sa kanya like typical strict parent rule. Idagdag mo nalang yung micromanaging ng lola ko mula household chores palang and pinarurusahan pa siya (corporal punishment) and pambugbog ni lolo. 

Pero ito na ang pinakamasakit na nangyari sa kanya-- nung pinagbuntis niya si kuya after niya grumaduate ng high school (16-17 years old) sinaktan muna siya ng sinaktan ni lolo hanggang sa tuluyan nang napalayas samin si mama kasama ng isa kong tita na never ko nameet hanggang sa namatay siya last year.

Decades later, nag reconnect sila lolo, lola maging si mama. Wala na kong naalala dito bukod sa napagalitan ako ni lolo. 

Nung Grade 6 ako, pinagtulungan akong saktan nila mama at tita (5th child sa walong magkakapatid) dahil aksidente ko nalublob ang sapatos ko sa baha and nung nalaman nilang Sgt. at Arms lang ako (for them, nothing is special on that position aside for being a tagabitbit ng upuan kada program). They don't take apologies, they don't take accidents. In their eyes, you intentionally ruined your school shoes and taking such a lowest position in your homeroom is a shame.

Mula high school until second year college (2019-2020 SY which halted due to pandemic) , binawal na sakin ang lahat--limiting all the interactions while nag aaral pa. Graduated and got shunned by my classmates post pandemic.

Back to the present, pati personal growth ko she tried to hinder it. Supposed na may work na ko sa isang BPO company bigla na kong pinauwi -- para lang gawing utusan at housekeeper sa bahay and she is no longer encouraging me to explore more opportunities. Basta as long na dito lang ako *dahil wala siyang tiwala sakin the way my late grandparents don't trust my mom back then*

Nung na orient ako sa mga cycles ng abuse, yung napapasa sa anak lahat ng dinanas nila before ay naranasan ng anak nila ngayon, I felt na isa ako sa kanila. Lahat ng frustrations ng magulang sa past nila, binabalik sa anak sa present. Inunawa ko siya at natutunan ko sa kanya ay kapag gagawin mo lang punching bag ang magiging anak mo, wag na lang mag anak.

It has been 13 years,"It has been 13 years since I told my parents that I was seeing then my boyfriend, now husband. It started like a normal day and then after breakfast I told my mother and stepfather I was seeing someone. I didn't expect just how extreme their reaction would be. I know they wouldn't be too happy because they were very strict. But I was 18, a legal adult who was leaving home for university in few short months so I thought that was enough for them to give some freedom. My mother went berserk. She yelled at me, cussed me out and called me a whore. She hurt me physically over and over. She threatened my life. My stepfather tried to play the nice guy by supposedly calming my mother. But I heard him egg her on. He asked to speak to my boyfriend to end our relationship. I was terribly frightened and helpless. Just after 9pm on that terrible day, I had to leave home and stay with a friend because my mother threatened more violence.

That was the start of their campaign of terror which lasted until the end of August when they eventually kicked me out of the house. I've always been abused in that house but they really ramped up the physical, mental and emotional abuse during those few weeks. I didn't even feel like human anymore towards the end. They've worn me down and I thought I was the worse person in the world. A dirty, good for nothing, whore of a daughter. 

Every year I feel the pain. As the months then the days approach to what I coined the anniversary, I am stuck in a cycle of reliving the pain. Some years I don't remember but when I close my eyes in the night I'm back in that moment. 

It has been 13 long years. I'm 31 now. I live in a nice house with the same man and have a good life. But every year, I feel like a helpless 18 year old again. My parents said I would understand their actions when I'm older. I'm still waiting for that day. The older I get, I feel more confused about their actions and their desire to hurt me. 

I feel angry because people in my world have moved on and expect me to do the same. I wish I can. I wish it doesn't hurt and that I no longer remember.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/158ams0/it_has_been_13_years/,t2_8epaki6q,2023-07-24 21:25:12,284,55
BF COLLECTING OUR FRIENDS AND MY BFF's BIKINI PICS ON IG,"Tangina lang talaga pero umay na umay na ko. Ilang taon niya nang ginagawa to. Una ko siyang nahula 2019 na nag nag sesave sa ig ng pics ng mga model, influencers, jowa ng mga kaibigan niya, at mga kaibigan ko na naka bikini. Siguro maiintindihan ko pa kung mga models at influencers lang eh pero tangina naman bakit pati mga gf ng tropa? Bakit pati mga barkada kong babae? Bakit pati pinsan ko nakita ko pa dun sa koleksyon niya?

Iwan ko na? Di kaya may anak kami eh. Mabuti naman siyang ama pero grabe napaka walang respeto sakin. Grabe din ang galing niya itago pero sorry sa sobrang trauma ko ang galing ko makita ng katarantaduhan niya.

7 years na kong nagpapakatanga. Pikit mata nalang kasi mas kaya kong tiisin yung sakit kesa yung anak ko yung masaktan pag nag hiwalay kami. Alam ko naman na kailangan kong bigyan ng respeto at halaga sarili ko pero napaka hirap pala pag may anak kayo? Ang hirap humiwalay sa gago. Oo di niya ko sinasaktan physically BUT THE MENTAL AND EMOTIONAL ABUSE IS BEYOND MY PATIENCE AND TOLERANCE.

Di lang yan eh. Lagi ko pa nahuhuli nag iinquire ng mga extra service, nuru, at linggam sa mga massage sites at telegram. Pinag bigyan ko na nga eh sabi ko sige ok lang sakin kung itry niya basta alam ko. Bat ako pumayag? Kasi tangina pagod na pagod na kong kontrahin. Oo nalang tayo for my peace of mind. Sabi niya di niya naman daw tinutuloy but how would i fucking know right?

At this point wala na talaga ayoko na. Wala na kong nararamdaman. I dont want to be with someone who blatantly disrespects me. Pero kailangan mag act normal kasi ayoko malanan ng anak namin at ng family namin na may problema.

Nagpa psych consultation na ko like 3x dahil nagka anxiety ako sa kagaguhan niya. SIYA BA NAG BAYAD NG 3K MAHIGIT PER CONSULTATION? Hinde. Pero tangina wala na kong ibang magpag labasan ng sama ng loob ko.

Di ko makausap nanay ko kasi anong sasabihin ko? Ma si ganito ginagawa to blah blah. Alangan siraan ko siya sa lola ng anak namin. Kwento ko sa bff ko? Sis galit ako sa jowa ko kasi sinesave bikini pics mo sa ig. Hehe. Ano yun?????

TANGINA TALAGA IYAK NALANG MUNA ME WALA NAMAN AKONG CHOICE. UNLI TANGA NALANG MUNA TALAGA SA NGAYON.

Di ko gets bat to ginagawa ng mga lalaki. Hindi ba ko enough? Hindi ako pangit fyi, slim with the right curves, i’m almost done with my post-grad degree, fluent in fucking english, my family’s comfortable, i smell fucking good in my versace, my ass is amazing, im above-average in school, im not a neglectful mother, YET I GET HIS BULLSHIT IN RETURN.

Im so sick of this recurring issue i swear i just wanna cry and punch his balls. I guess no matter how good enough you are, the wrong person will never appreciate you.

Salamat sa pag basa. :( prayers nalang siguro tnx po

My Last message to my Daddys baby who hurt us. As i mourn to my baby he is busy finding someone else. ,"Dear K
 
I am writing this letter to bid you a final farewell, although it is not without a heavy heart and a burning anger. Our journey together has been marred by your deceit, manipulation, and the unimaginable pain you have caused me.
 
You were the father of our child, but your actions have shown a complete disregard for both me and our baby. Your infidelity, emotional abuse, and the fact that you failed to mourn the loss of our child have left me shattered and filled with rage.
 
I hate you for the pain you inflicted upon me. I hate you for the lies and the betrayal. I hate you for the way you treated me, mentally and emotionally, leaving scars that may never fully heal.
 
But as I bid you farewell, I want you to know that I am reclaiming my strength and my power. I refuse to let your actions define me or hold me back. I will rise above the ashes you left behind and rebuild my life, stronger and more resilient than ever before.
 
I hope that one day you will realize the magnitude of the pain you have caused. I hope you will reflect on your actions and make amends, not just for my sake, but for the sake of any future relationships you may have.
 
Goodbye, Daddy K. Happy Birthday  May you find the redemption and growth that you so desperately need.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1bk7uk0/my_last_message_to_my_daddys_baby_who_hurt_us_as/,t2_qyjkag6qo,2024-03-21 22:29:24,5,1
Finally after 2 failed relationships,"I met my current girlfriend last year about 2 months after my last failed relationship which was marred by intense emotional abuse and gaslighting. We didn’t exactly hit it off right away as lovers but eventually, I came to realize just how loving, caring, understanding, and supportive she was. While studying for law school entrance exams, she always gave me that extra lift I needed to keep going even though I was close to collapsing with exhaustion. I disclosed to her my GAD diagnosis and she was not only supportive about my mental health, she checks up on me every day and conducts mini debriefings of everyday events to help make sure I’m ready to face new days ahead. We are in a healthy, loving, mutually giving, and uplifting relationship. Yesterday, after we had a FaceTime call that lasted hours, as I went to sleep, I cried as I reflected on how just the right person, the right timing, and the right circumstances could lead me to her, the one. After being emotionally abused and taken advantage of in my previous relationships, I’m more than comfortable enough to say I don’t think I’ll ever have another one.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/14hq8rp/finally_after_2_failed_relationships/,t2_8t81nsbf,2023-06-24 19:08:08,7,0
Pagod na ako sa sarili ko,"Di ko alam kung kanino ko sasabihin lahat ng 'to so dito ko na ilalabas. 

Bata palang ako alam ko na na may mali sakin. Madaming nangyari sa buhay ko na naging dahilan para maging ganito ako. From Emotional to Physical abuse, to Financial and s*xual abuse. 

It started with anger management issues, mood swings,disruption in sleep up to extreme forgetfulness. Yung sobrang makakalimutin ko and yung pagiging inattentive ko, yung pinaka malaking reason kung bakit nahihirapan ako ngayon. I can't even remember what I did today and even yesterday. 

Depression comes in and go sakin. Di ko alam kung kailan ako last na mawalan ng suicidal thoughts or kung kailan ako nagkaroon ng genuine interest sa mga bagay sa paligid ko. Di ko na maalala.

I'm mentally unwell & it's hurting my loved ones,"Ang hirap maging mentally unwell. And I see how it's hurting my family & friends everytime they see me break. They're fixing things within me that they didn't even destroy to begin with.

I've been diagnosed in 2019 with depression & anxiety. But I know I've been experiencing it years prior pa. I know there are improvements sa depression ko. It's been a year since my last attempt but I do get anxiety & panic attacks. I was getting better.

Now, my mentally abusive, emotionally abusive, & financially abusive left me with PTSD. I got a half-assed apology & a thank you for saving him financially. Aminado siya na ginamit niya daw ako & he exploited my care for him sa dulo ng relasyon namin kasi alam niyang sasaluhin ko siya through & through. How he hurt me physically (unintentional daw), mentally, emotionally, & financially is unbelievable. Ubos na ubos ako nung iniwan niya. Ubos yung savings ko, sirang sira ako. While he's out there fucking his kabit (and now newly promoted to girlfriend).

Every single day, I get flashbacks. I fall into spiral of overthinking & consistent anxiety attacks. I get triggered & breakdown at the slightest reminder of them. I sometimes wake up in the middle of the night high on my fight or flight response —akala ko I'm back in our old apartment na inaalog at sinisigaw-sigawan niya ako or I'm waiting for him to get home from his motel nights with his kabit. It's manifesting in my health too. I couldn't sleep. I get severe headaches. I passed out a few times. I don't function well anymore.

My friends & family are out here trying to assist me & help me out. They're fixing me. They're doing their best to help me, especially my parents. And I know they're starting to get tired.

I'm doing everything I can to speed up my recovery. I spent a lot on check-ups, counselling, self-help books, medications & vitamins. I exert effort na bigyan sarili ko ng distractions. I'm trying hard.

Napaka hayop ng ex ko. Everyone around me is hurting because he abused me. He made my mental health worse. Akala niya ba ganun ganun lang yun? Emotional manipulation is not a joke. Also, katamtaman lang sahod ko. Everything I gave him, sagad na sagad talaga. Dugo't pawis puhunan. Tapos ayaw pa magbayad ngayon. Galing niya, nagbigay ng C-PTSD para di ko siya masingil ng ayos. He's even spreading na I have anxiety & that I'm lucky he stayed kahit na I was ill. Pa-hero effect pa. My anxiety worsened because he kept asking me for money & not allowing me to even take a rest.

I will either end up killing myself or killing him & a bit of his new girlfriend.

I'm sorry mom & dad. I want to fight and reclaim my life & voice but it's been tough.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/17kpctu/im_mentally_unwell_its_hurting_my_loved_ones/,t2_m8sttj9l7,2023-11-01 00:41:58,2,1
Ang sama-sama mo,"Walong taon lang ako nun, dapat ang iniisip ko lang nun ay mag laro, pero dahil sayo gusto ko na agad mamatay at maglaho sa mundo. 


Ang sama-sama mo. Araw araw sa loob ng isang taon, pinarurusahan mo ko dahil hindi ko ma-meet ang standards mo. Ang manipulative mo, emotionally abusive, mentally abusive, verbally abusive sakin. Tapos sa harap ng lahat ng tao ang baitbait mo. Pinaniwala mo silang lahat na paborito mo ako, habang inuubos mo onti onti ang amor ko sa mundo at tiwala ko sa tao.

Binully nila ako buong anim na taon ng elementarya at dahil sayo, naniwala akong nararapat lang yung ganoong pagtrato sa walang kwenta na kagaya ko. 


Pinaniwala mo ako na napaka walang kwenta ko, na palagi akong mali, na wag na akong magsalita dahil makakasakit lang ako ng iba. Na hindi ako pwede maglaro manlang o tumayo sa upuan na lecheng upuan na yan. Para akong manika na sunod sunod sa kung anong gusto mo. Miski pag ngiti, hindi ko pwede gawin kapag walang permiso mo.

Nobody loves me and I’m such a failure ,"I apologize in advance for ranting heavily. Just need to get this out of my chest and mind. There are times that I just want to disappear from the world because nobody loves me and I’m a fucking loser and failure compared to my friends and cousins. Yes, I think of contemplating su***de more often lately because my life is a joke and full of traumatic experiences and memories. 

 I used to get physically, emotionally and mentally abused by my dad when I was younger. I still remember that time na hinabol nya ako ng kutsilyo and bitayin nya ako patiwarik. And also that time when he used to hit my head against the wall when I was in grade school. Tapos ung mom ko naman binubugbog din siya at natatakot kahit na magstand up for me. Tapos nung nagkawork na ako panay utang and naka-asa naman siya sa akin. I also used to be close with my brothers pero nung inuwi sila sa pinas ng dad ko feeling ko lalo lang ako nalungkot. May mga lola and lolo naman ako pero magmula nang nagmigrate dito sa Canada, I miss them a lot and it’s been 7 years since I haven’t seen them. Same with friends. 

Di pa nakatulong ung mga countless times na naging sawi ako sa lovelife. Halos lahat na ata ng pangit experiences sa lovelife na experience ko na. Physically, mentally, emotionally, verbally, sexually and financially abused tapos pinaasa, got cheated on, and lied to. Tapos ung mga pagcocompare sa akin to my cousin na kesyo siya nakatapos ng pag aaral, nurse na, may sariling kotse na, panay travel and may happy relationship with a canadian (afam) guy samantalang ako wala ako kahit ano nun. 

Diba? I’m so fucking pathetic and living a worthless life. Ano pa ba purpose ko sa mundo? Kung di lang dahil sa pet dog ko siguro kaya di pa ako namamatay.

I hate my boyfriend's fraternity. So. Much.,"I love my boyfriend so much but lately I can't stand his behaviour. His org, his fraternity, takes pride in their application process which involves psychologically hazing and hurling emotional abuse to its applicants. It also interferes with their acads which is already mentally draining to begin with. The whole idea is to break their applicants down psychologically, emotionally, and mentally so that they can see who can withstand pressure and will be worthy of joining their org. There's no physical abuse, but they are made to do physically draining tasks and military-like exercises. I know a lot of orgs do these kind of application processes, but that doesn't make it okay at all and his seems to be longer in duration and stronger in intensity than the average org. It's all so unnecessarily cruel. 

I hated this org when he applied, as I felt like it was putting so much pressure on him when he already had a lot of change to deal with. I hated to think that he was being shouted at, humiliated, forced to do tasks that he would normally be embarrassed to do; plus there was so much to do that it took away a substantial time that could have been used for rest or to study for acads. To the point that he would get physically sick from exhaustion. All in the guise of creating a support system and friends. 

Now that he's no longer an applicant, but a facilitator,  it's all so much worse. How could he be okay with shouting at his juniors? Making them do embarrassing, tiring, menial, and at the same time physically and emotionally draining tasks. To the point that some of the applicants break down or self harm themselves to cope with the pressure. How could he not see the hypocrisy of wanting to be each other's ""family"" but the same time hazing these people? I hate it. I hate knowing that he is capable of bullying, and worse that he can't see that it's bullying. He is justifying all of it; that it is necessary, effective. I hate the self righteousness of it all.

I can't hide my emotions (no poker face at all) so he can always tell that I am not thrilled when he tells me about his org activities. I am trying to be supportive and understanding so as to avoid possible arguments but I just can't yet control my emotions. Yet I can't be open about it as much as I would like,  how much I hate this org, because he LOVES this org. He LOVES this org so much. It is his support system and barkada. How could I possibly take that away from him??

I’m tired of the heartache I feel in this home.,"I don’t think I was ever heard or was asked about how I felt. Even though I had to endure many years of verbal and emotional abuse in my childhood. I was told na “intindihin na lang” ganito ganyan. I am sad for myself that I had to grow up here. This environment here has so much tension and hostility, mostly caused by my mother. Now it’s not directed towards me, but to my grandmother because she doesn’t know how to be nice to her. 

I do not want the life she introduced me to. I want to move abroad na. AS IN. My biggest fear is growing old here. 

I know I could easily find jobs abroad, but I work as a graphic designer and unfortunately there aren’t a lot of creative jobs abroad for me (or willing to sponsor). Hindi ko na kaya. I do not want to be here anymore. I want to experience a peaceful and gentle home.

My Abusive Family's Financial Problem Is Giving Me Severe Anxiety,"A little context: I've been working for about several years now. After dealing with years of abuse from my own family, especially from my mom, I decided to live alone. Eventually, I met my life partner and created our own family. My mom had millions of loans that she was trying to get me to pay. I didn't agree. She's very emotionally abusive and will gaslight me para lang mapasunod ako sa gusto nya. Dati lagi akong umiiyak kapag ginagawa nya sakin yun, but I went numb. I still give her monthly allowance dahil it's my responsibility. IDK why, but my mom would tell her partner and siblings na parang pinapabayaan namin sya. It's always the victim mindset. Sobrang nakakapagod tulungan sya. Pero wala along choice kase tulungan ko sya or hindi, ako parin and magiging masama.

&#x200B;

Now, both my mom and my sister (who also emotionally abused me) got into a very bad situation where they solely rely on me for financial help. My sister got sick and not able to work while my mom makes small money from her little business. I admit the money that I'm sending them is not enough for what they need. Their monthly needs costs about 50,000 pesos and I'm trying to provide what I can. I'm at the point where I'm contemplating of working abroad even if I really don't want to. Mind you, I earn way above the usual salary here in the PH. My salary is around 80k. But it's not enough to make the ends meet with my responsibilities. I really don't know what to do to the point I'm having panic attacks and severe anxiety. I can't sleep most of the time and have been having really bad nightmares. I can't answer my mom's calls most of the time because of this. I've been rage applying to jobs. My husband even want to learn my job so that he can help me when I apply for an additional full time job. I feel defeated. Any advise? What should I do?

Isang buong taon akong walang gang kumain, Gabi gabing umiiyak pero nag fu-function pa Rin Naman SA school at socially nung year 2018, senior high pa lang ako nun tsaka mag isa lang ako sa tinitirhan ko dahil sa malayo Yung lugar namin sa  mga magagandang skwelahan 
For context alam Kong nag suffer nako Ng depression kahit elementary palang ako dahil dii maganda relasyon ko mama ko, papa ko Lang naging kakampi sa sa buhay Kaya malaki impact nung pagkawala nya. I became suicidal in thoughts and in actions nag self harm ako kapag DIKO na Kaya
Umabot ako SA puntong PATI leeg KO nasusugatan KO na nang dko namamalayan

I didn't offer to mend him back katunayan nun iniwasan ko sya nung nalaman kong Hindi pa sya fully healed sa past relationships nya
Pinursue nya ako promising that he is over with his ex and was ready to face new year with me, he pursued me for almost 2 months and we made it official
We lasted 2 years, pero SA loob nun I was subject to mental and emotional abuse habang tumatagal parang naging emotional dump nya ako, lahat ng galit nya sakin nya binubuga

Im tired of being a nice guy.,"So many relationship ended up with me being second. I've met and dated many women, took most to dancing, courted and been in a relationship with a select few. Unfortunately all ended up leaving me(some even cheated). Gave them everything i could and loved them like their the only woman in the world. Learned how to do hair and makeup so i can relate. But sadly i learned the hard way that the phrase good guys always end up last is definitely true. Its hard to trust and go out there again. Sometimes i think it would be best for me to just be alone. They prefer someone that would just use and abuse them emotionally and physically.

I’m going through a break up (due to compatibility issues and my ex was emotionally and sexually abusive—different story) and I just tell myself it’s better to be on my own than with the wrong person. 

Totoo nga sinabi nila once naabot mo na yung sobra sobra kang sinaktan ng isang tao, matatakot ka na sumubok ulit. Takot ka nang masaktan ulit. Takot ka nang mapunta sa maling tao. You don’t trust yourself anymore to make good judgement if a situation will be good for you. 

My focus now is to heal myself and love myself. Yung sobrang love ko yung sarili ko di ko na kailangan ng partner because I’ll be more than enough. I’ll be happy on my own. Hindi ko na iniisip na may dadating pa sa future. Ayaw ko na talaga.

Violence Against Men,"TW: Physical Abuse

It just feels disappointing that men have no legal protection against any form of abuse or domestic violence. I (M31) had an ex gf who used to hurt me physically, and it occurred many times. Note that I did not cheat on her nor committed any grave offense against her. But everytime her emotions piled up, she used to hurt me physically, as in I got slaps on my face, arm, etc. 

After 9 months, I called it quits. I did not stand the abuse anymore.

Im so happy I’m healed,"GOOD FREAKING MORNING. I JUST WOKE AND I JUST WANT TO SAY IM SO FUCKING HAPPY. I NEVER THOUGHT THIS DAY WOULD COME. I AM FINALLY BACK IN MY LIFE, back in track. I AM HEALED. I AM OKAY. I AM NOT ANGRY OR REGRETFUL ANYMORE. FOR ONCE, I LOVE MY LIFE AND ACTUALLY WANT TO LIVE. 

My parents separated when I was young so what happened between them caused some traumas. I was hesitant to get into a relationship until I met this guy through a common friend. I dated him for a year and more. It was so toxic and draining. He manipulated and gaslighted me throughout the relationship. He was my first boyfriend so I fell really hard and loved him more than I love myself. I would cry everyday for the way he was treating me. He would cuss me out, get mad at me for no reason, accused me of cheating, and more things that made me mentally drained. He was mentally and emotionally abusing me that I started cutting myself because I wanted to die for the way he was making me feel. There was a point in our relationship where we got into physical fights more than once and I had bruises all over my body. I had to wear long sleeve and pants just to keep it hidden from my family. I was so so blind. My love for him blinded me from reality. I was so ready to drop everything for him but thank God, my family interfered or else I would’ve been still stuck in that situation. I am so so thankful for my family and friends for knocking some sense into me. I’m also super thankful for God for removing him from my life so I wouldn’t lose track of my goals and lose myself totally. Now, I’m in my happiest point of my life. God is good.

To anyone who’s struggling whether about relationships, work, family or anything. Always remember that we will all get through this. This one bible verse is so beautiful that I think everyone needs to know — Romans 8:18 “The sufferings we have now are nothing compared to the great glory that will be given to us.”

A recovering Nymphomaniac,"I've been SA throughout my childhood and in my teens i became a nymphomaniac, at first I used sexual gestures to gain favors and feel good about myself I thought since I'm already getting unwarranted sexual attention from males might as well use it to my advantage, until it became a form of self harm, everytime I feel angry or  have any negative emotions I seek sexual relief. For the longest time I thought since I allow it, it's okay because it's a transaction and it's on my terms but the resentment never went away and I grew to hate myself every time. The feeling of emptiness never fails to make me feel worthless and dirty but I thought this is the only way I will be wanted and validated, so I just never stopped until I can no longer control it. Today I'm trying to unlearn this behavior and slowly but surely I start to appreciate myself and value myself as a woman, I'm 26 now and throughout my journey of healing I realized I hate sex and especially being sexualized, I thought it felt good but I was just gaslighting myself, to enable and justify what they're doing and to give myself a false sense of control when in fact I never left that cycle.

Hypersexuality became an unhealthy coping mechanism for me and instead of freeing myself from the abuse, I abused myself. There's so much to learn in forgiving myself, respecting myself and loving myself, There's also so much healing ahead but recognizing I need help is a very crucial step.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1c3c3cg/a_recovering_nymphomaniac/,t2_xh5ee757u,2024-04-14 05:02:18,69,11

i just want to know where does her hatred of me stems from? I've never been one to fight back, sinusunod ko naman mga utos niya, i help her out when she needs help. Pero bakit? Bakit ang laki ng galit mo sakin, ate? She'd go home from school, see something na hindi ko naman kasalanan and still blame it on me.

"Same situation, same mistakes..","I used to beg God to get me out of a bad relationship because I'm pretty much bad at getting out on my own.

Past 12mn,"Everything’s a mess. You know you’re fucked up when you don’t even understand how you feel. I don’t get how my heart weighs and hurts this much while  I act like every burden was cleansed in my lifetime. Am I so used to putting up a facade and convince people, even myself, that I’m okay? Or is it because i was raised in a family where showing emotion is a weakness and your best bet in surviving in our abusive house hold is being negligent specially when it comes to emotions. 
Both sounds right, but either way, it ultimately comes back to me being somewhat delusional. Delusional in a way that, I give myself false images of me being happy, bathing in thoughts solely to distract me of my own demise. Falling further in the abyss of my emotions. The weight of thoughts anchored in my chest, making me digress from the subject of what made me crippled and lifeless. 
I've been so used to wearing masks, hiding behind pretenses to cower from the face of reality.

Boundaries in Family Relationships,"Have you ever get irritated sa tuwing sinasabi sa inyong ""Tatay/Nanay mo pa din yan"".
I feel like they use ""family"" as a free pass to be an asshole. 

Just a context, my dad and I drifted apart when I turned 19. This is because I've been emotionally and sexually abused by him as a child. My mom died when I was 10 and ever since then, the abuse started. 
I never spoke up about it because I thought it was my fault and I was so scared to lose another parent. 
But after I graduated college, we had a big fight about all the things he did to me and I was victim blamed by him. 
After that, we didn't talk for almost 4 years. 

We recently reconnected when my grandfather died last year. Civil kami and I still remain respectful even after everything that happened. I am getting the help that I need and because of that I was able to build boundaries. 

I promised myself na hindi ko na hahayaang matakot at saktan pa ako. 
I only talk to him pag kapatid ko na pinag-uusapan. 
Fast forward to last weekend, I got into a vehicular accident. 
I was lucky that my injuries weren't serious but I had to stay at the hospital for three days. 
I informed him about it out of courtesy. 
He never even visited nor ask me how I was. 
He only communicated through his wife (yes, he remarried and I believe my stepmom is emotionally abused as well) 

Then today, he got mad about a choice that I made. Suddenly, he called me ungrateful, selfish, and disrespectful. 
He said that he was so disappointed at me. 

Honestly, I wasn't hurt. I was angry. 
Angry that he had the audacity to call me all those names despite being independent, liberated, and successful at my age (F24). 
Yes, I replied back.
I made sure that my message is respectful enough. 

Sabi ko doon ""Shouldn't you be more disappointed at yourself because you have so much to improve on as a father and a human being?""
I even suggested that he seeks a mental health professional because how he acts and responds is not normal anymore. 

But of course, I knew he'll retaliate by telling me that I'm ungrateful and rude. He even threatened me na wag ko na daw sya kausapin and wag pumunta sa libing niya. 

It's such a relief that I got him out of my life. This was the last straw. There's so much trauma and pain he caused me. Being biologically related doesn't mean that I have to be treated like this. 

It took so much time and energy to get to where I am. I feel like I have taken back the power he removed from me when I was by his side.

My brother hugged me for the first time,"Backstory; I was a horrible big brother to this kid. I bullied him when we were younger and poured my frustrations of high school life/drama/insecurities onto him. Add in the fact I was raised in an EXTREMELY homophobic household (my brother came out as gay). Legit, I got my ass beat by my dad because I was good in (from his words) 'gay' subjects like general studies, english, etc. And sucked at MANLY subjects like math and science. (he's changed now, don't worry) but yeah, just an idea of how toxic our household is. My brother and I took the most beating from our parents, actually my brother did because there were times I hit him too. More times than I can count. He was a kid that always gets in trouble so he kept getting his ass beat. Can't blame him though, of how shitty we treated him, he had to blow steam off somehow. I didn't know this back then. In Psychology, there's a name for that, the ONE family member that takes ALL the shit but I forgot the actual name of it. Anyways my brother is that guy. I treated him like shit, just like all of my family members did for a long time. Till he grew up and the verbal abuse kinda stopped? At least for us siblings. My parents still kinda like that to him sometimes. 

Fast forward to years later. I've become aware of my actions and all that. We were ok for a few years but not close like how siblings can be sometimes. Until he moved in with me a couple of weeks ago. 

Something bad happened at work and I tried to help him and we talked for a couple of hours and he ended up crying. I hugged him and he kept on crying. 

I said it's okay. 
Just let it all out. 
Nothing wrong with that. I know that what happened hurts and that life is kinda shitty sometimes that things like this happens. 

After the whole ordeal, as I went to bed, he was just standing in my doorway and he was stuttering and anxious. I went over to him and he said he was feeling emotional but he had his arms and hands halfway open like he wanted a hug. 

THIS KID WANTED A HUG BUT HE DIDN'T KNOW HOW. 

So I gave him a hug and he wrapped his arms around me SO TIGHT and I realized he's never hugged me like this. It was always a half hug when we say goodbye and shit like that. 

Not like this. 

It was at this moment, I felt like he forgave me for all the physical and verbal abuse I threw at him. He said he used to be so scared of me as a kid. I carried that weight for a long time until he hugged me like this. 

He said he's never showed emotions in front of anyone because honestly, growing up in that toxic household, emotions were deemed weak. He said that this is the first time he ever truly felt comfortable opening up. 

I teared up knowing that all the years I was away my brother didn't have anybody to hold him like this and tell him that it's going to be okay. 

Jesus Christ. Our parents really fucked us up. 

This upbringing of conservative/orthodox asian household needs to stop. 

Anyways, that's all folks. Till the next emotional revelation! 

P. S. If you and your siblings fight, let it go. We shouldn't treat our siblings like how our parents treated us. Let's end this generational upbringing of abuse.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/z7zeyk/my_brother_hugged_me_for_the_first_time/,t2_cbwejcgd,2022-11-30 00:57:32,135,24
News about animal abuse and death,"Yoko talagang makakita ng news or articles about animal abuse or death that involves suffering. In a way, I’m glad some news are getting viral para mapansin ng mga authorities and we can do something about it, but it’s also hard to process it emotionally and mentally. I’ve been avoiding clicking articles or even engaging on tweets or post about the most recent news pero aksidente ko paring nabasa yung nangyari bc someone shared it.

And yeah ayun runner and a chaser and then i decided to stop na nga for my sanity then i met this 2nd one. I was sexually abused. Maybe people will make fun of me bout this. Pero i was forced to have sex with her. Ayoko that time. So yep-i thought i was sexually abused. It gets to me na ayaw ko na makipagusap kahit knino- unless if its work.

comparing success of other relatives,"So my cousin's wife passed the bar yesterday, my family already extended our congratulatory remarks on them on Facebook. Then at home my mom said, oh kung tinuloy mo sana masteral mo e di graduate ka na rin. Like wtf?
Pakitaan ba to ng achievements? 

Last year she was complaining on why would I waste my time for a masteral degree because I enrolled last summer, but I stopped my thesis this year because I can't risk my savings on a half-hearted reseach and deprecating mental health.
Now that my relative has gain an achievement,  gusto nya kami rin.

Gumastos ako last year to seek help from a psychologist kasi sa mga emotional abuse nya amin na mga anak nya. (my mom is a house wife) maybe that's why sometimes I think naiinggit din sya at my mga work kami.

Anyways, right now I'm rethinking of resigning at work with no back up lol, I can't imagine her disappointment towards me.

Meron bang tatay na hindi mainitin ang ulo,"Nakakafrustrate lang, feeling ko buong buhay ko kinailangan ko magdeal sa anger issues ng tatay ko. Di siya physically abusive, pero emotionally abusive sya. Ginagawa akong sounding board sa mga problema nya at puro rant sa mga kapatid niyang paulit ulit. Napakabilis magalit, parang ang hirap gumalaw sakanya minsan, iniisip ko palagi may magagawa akong mali. 

Kung kailan akala ko narerepair na relationship namin kasi unti unti ko na syang napapatawad sa trauma na binigay nya sakin nung pagkabata hanggang college, narerealize ko paring di siya nagbago. Andun parin anger issues nya na madali lang biglang magresurface. 

Nagvolunteer pa syang turuan ako magmaneho, pero ang dali lang nya mafrustrate at magalit tuwing di ko nagegets kagad. 

Naiinggit talaga ako sa mga taong close sa tatay nila o kaya mag tatay na sobrang patient sakanila at di mainitin ang ulo. Sobrang foreign tlga ng concept sakin na may ganung tatay pala. Yung makakausap mo nang maayos, mashasharean ng problema, yung emotionally mature enough na kayang macontrol galit nila at maging patient sayo. 

Sobrang sama ko para sabihin to, pero sana iba nalang naging tatay ko.

EDIT: Naiyak ako pagkatapos ng driving lessons. Mas gugustuhin ko nlng magextend ng hours sa driving school kesa magtiis sa ganitong pagtuturo.

MY ABUSIVE EX BOYFRIEND IS RUNNING FOR SK.,"trigger warning // mentions sexual harassment, rape and abusive relationship

I’m going to post this here kasi sobrang sama talaga ng loob ko ever since I (21F) saw several posters of my ex (22M) plastered all over our barangay and found out that he really was running for SK thru a friend of mine. Naiinis ako because hindi niya deserve. Hindi niya deserve maging SK Kagawad. Hindi niya deserve ang suporta na binibigay sa kanya ngayon ng mga taga-rito samin.

Every time that I see his stupid fucking face, nagagalit ako at naaalala ko kung paano niya ako trinato nung kami pa. From bullying me, physically, verbally and emotionally abusing me, and on top of that, sexually harassing and raping me, hindi niya talaga deserve maging SK Kagawad. Every time that I see his poster na naka-ngiti, I want to rip that poster and burn it. Worst of all, dahil maliit lang ang mundo, I see my facebook friends sharing the posts he uploaded while doing community service na ang caption ay “si (ex) ang SK ko! baka SK ko yan! serbisyong mabait at tapat!” and I can’t help but roll my eyes, dahil hindi naman totoo na mabait siya; and those same people are the ones na nag-push sa ex ko to sexually harass me for him to “be a real man and let go of celibacy”.

Your SK Kagawad fucking abused me throughout our 5-year relationship and here I am, two years later, still healing from the trauma he fucking left. Ang hirap lang, tangina. One minute I tell myself that I’m fine, the second I’m mad and crying dahil naalala ko lahat ng ginawa niya. Ang hirap lang kasi I remember speaking up about what he did to me, yet I ended up becoming the bad person dahil “mabait” at catechist siya sa simbahan – mas maraming naniniwala sa kanya, kesa sakin at hinding-hindi niya kayang gawin ang mga sinabi ko dahil anak siya ng Diyos, lol. Your SK Kagawad made me feel small, pakiramdam ko napaka-dumi kong tao sa mga pinaggagawa niya sakin throughout the whole duration of our relationship. Tangina, yang SK Kagawad niyo magaling mag-baliktad ng storya!

Your SK kagawad is a liar, abusive and rapist. He’s a fucking bastard, he doesn’t deserve that position. Kung siya ang future ng city na to o ng barangay na to, tangina.

Guilt after break up,"Kinakain ako ng guilt lately.

Just for context, I (29) ended my 9-yr realationship with the father (33) of my kids. We have three children. It’s been three months since I decided to end things with him. He is narcissistic manipulator and he has the same traits as my mom. So mom blames me for not giving my kids a complete family. Recently pinagmumura nya (mom) ako. Saying wala akong kwentang nanay. Kinuha kasi ng tatay mga bata kasi sembreak naman, and don’t want to deal the “silence” at home. So I am now staying at a friends house. Just having some time for myself. Kasi alam ko na if I stayed home, it will lead to depression.

I know my ex and mom has been contacting nonstop since pavictim nga ang ex ko. For 7 years we stayed and sa side ng ex ko, nakabukod but malapit sa family nya. Sa loob ng 7 yrs, 3 yrs non disrespect, mental and emotional abuse nakuha ko. The next 4 years was me realizing it was not worth it, but still continued to hope na magbago sya. Na he would see my worth. But no. We decided to move sa house ng mom ko sa probinsya since wala nakatira. the last two years… exit plan. 

And I did it. In that entire 7 years na nagstay ako with him. I don’t open up sa family ko kung ano nangyayarii, kasi I know they have their own burden. I post sa soc med na we are a happy family. Little did they know that I mostly cried at night, while someone beside me is deeply asleep, snoring. As if he was mocking me even if he was asleep.

I am now seeing someone. It was not easy for my ex to accept that. He called me a whore. They (ex and mom) called me a whore. And I know, I have said that “ako muna” and there is nothing wrong with choosing yourself. But tbh, their words affect me. And I hate it. 

How not to be affected?",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1adq0rm/guilt_after_break_up/,t2_a23tjxxv,2024-01-29 15:54:31,19,0

For future parents,"TW: abuse

Sa mga future parents dyan, kung di nyo lang kayang mahalin at alagaan ang (o mga) magiging anak nyo, wag na lang kayo mag-anak.

Grew up in an emotionally and physically abusive family. I am old enough pero hanggang ngayon ang abusive pa rin ng nanay ko sa amin. Grade school pa lang ako she has been calling us names: tamad, batugan, walang silbi, patabaing baboy. Dad didn't know the  and couldn't do anything since he worked somewhere else. At kahit naman nasa bahay sya, di nya rin naman kayang pigilan yung asawa nya. Lumaki kaming walang respeto sa amin ang nanay namin. Yung baong binibigay sa amin, parang utang na loob pa namin. It was like money that we had to work/slave up for like house chores. Hindi pwede mediocre linis dahil ipapahiya ka nya kahit sa harap ng ibang tao kung may na-miss kang spot. Isang beses, i was beaten hard kasi hindi ko na-mop yung garage. Imagine an 11 year old girl being beaten with broom sticks, hangers, etc. My 2 younger sibs had it better. Nung time nila di na ganon namamalo yung nanay ko, pero the verbal abuse is still there. I admit, I am no perfect child. And I am trying to take the right path naman kaya nga ako bumalik sa school. Before I enrolled, tinanong ko sya kung okay lang ba. Pumayag naman sya, kaso alam ko naman sa sarili ko na kahit pumayag sya, once may f2f classes na di na sya magbibigay ng baon or pahirapan makahingi ng baon at contributions. Tama hinala ko. Katulad nung bata kami, ang hirap manghingi kahit pasahe lang. Di rin naman makaka-save dahil saktuhan lang yung binibigay nya. I tried to work part time kaso my course is demanding. Gusto ko na lang matapos to get out of 'her' house and her life. Or kung manalo ako sa lotto, bibigyan ko na lang sya ng chunk nun para sa lahat ng ginastos nya buong buhay ko tapos aalis ako at magpapakalayo. Di ko naman hiningi na iluwal nya ako sa mundo. Nung bata ako, akala ko ampon ako. Madalas iniisip ko nun kelan kaya dadating yung real parents ko para kunin na ako. As i get older, di naman maipagkakaila na anak nga nila ako kasi kamuka ko naman sila.

Kung magsalita yung nanay ko parang napaka-samang tao ko. I started to think of unaliving myself at 9 years old. Ngayong matanda na ako, di ko pala kaya pero tanggap ko na kung maaga akong kukunin ni Lord.

Stop procreating!!!,"I've been hating my life for the longest and suicidal. 

Here's why, 
Mom and dad is not emotionally matured enough to raise a loving family. 
My dad ended up cheating leaving my mom in misery, Became an OFW to support us. 
Our oldest brother end up being a criminal, My Oldest sister became the head of the family since dad no longer with us and mom is abroad. (She was just in 3rd year college btw) 
My other brother who is 5years older than me plays the victim role and the bully alternately. 
I am the punching bag. 

- I grew up having a conflicted personality coz I always need to be conscious with the way I behave, They are easily irritated and gets angry. My childhood years was like walking on eggshells, constant fear and anxiety. 

- I thought that my emotion never matter since I am always invalidated growing up. 

- We were poor and my sister needs to sacrifice her studies for us. 

- My sister lived in with her partner, I end up living with my brother which was hell. I always cry at night, He screams at me all the time and verbally abused me, Physical abuse was also present. I thought all families are like this. 

- Present- I am now 29, living faw away,  No plans to get married or have kids,  Why? I still have all the traumas in me. I still hear voices in my head. I have issues socializing, I still cry, I dunno bounderies, I am so hard on myself everytime I fail on something. I even caught myself repeating the behavior of my brother to my colleagues. I feel so mentally fucked up in life. 

I am writing this to whoever may read this to please THINK a million times before you procreate. 
Ask yourself if you can give your child a complete loving and supportive family, Financial support and emotional support. 

You might not see the bigger effects of this neglects yet, but try to dig deep why there are psychopaths, sociopaths or increased with  depression cases,  uproductive prople of the society etc. 

I am speaking from a perspective of a neglected child who constantly fights depression, traumas and urge of wanting to k*ll someone/myself. I never wanted to be born anyways. What choice do I have coming to this world.

I want to run away but I'm scared.,"TW: physical, and emotional abuse mention

(Sorry for the wrong Filipino terms English is my first language even if I'm half-Filo)

Hi, 18 na ako since last year pa - turning 19 this year. Trans male ako, I knew since I was a teen pa. I live in a upperclassmen home, no rent just bills but I want to run away and go somewhere far far from my family.

 I have been abused since I was a kid, my dad had a bad temper cause of his own dad. He would hit us when we did something wrong, or yell at us if we didn't do it quick enough or right in his eyes. He has lessened the physical violence since we're older now, but won't hesitate to shout and cuss us out if we don't meet his standards.

I live with my mom, brother (24M), sister (19F), and dad's side in the house. Hindi ako pwede umalis without permission, kasi girl ako. My sister is treated much worse, as a black sheep for some reason hindi ko alam why. She is a good student, very loud but very bubbly to everyone, really nice. Yet my mom doesn't like her, says she's being influenced by her friends? but I know her friends, they're fine - just loud lang.

Just recently lang, my sister got too loud and was yelled at - told off for being a disturbance, kasi she got too heated in a game. My mom pulled her aside, and I won't go into detail, but she is in danger of getting kicked out.

I don't want her to leave, I don't know what I'd do without her kasi, but she's at risk of getting hurt before kicked out daw. I want her to be safe, but I don't want her to stay here too. Our home is very unstable but it's a good home outside of the family issues.

I only have debit and gcash but it's not enough if she leaves, I want to go with her if that happens, I don't want her to be alone. I want to get a job but not even allowed part time bc of college. Everything I own belongs to my family, aside from a few things that aren't important.

I want to keep her safe bc she raised me, but I don't want to get hurt and kicked out too. I want to support her in every way possible.  I'm not skilled in anything but drawing.

Sorry po if this is disorganized, I'm very worried for my sister and I needed to rant.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1b5elln/i_want_to_run_away_but_im_scared/,t2_ocddjwbam,2024-03-03 18:59:56,1,0
Forbidden Perfect Love 💔💔☹️😢😔💔💔,"So I (32F) have a bf now (31M), and napakabait ni bf as in. Sobrang match kami pati ugali namin in all aspects except religion (he is INC, I'm Catholic). Physically, both are good-looking naman. Ugali naman, parehong mabait. Intimately, sobrang magkasundo din kami (my late hubby doesn't like to have sex with me kahit I have that body na gustuhin) 

But here's the catch, he's 2 years separated no communication (pinagpalit sya and hurt by his wife emotionally and sometimes physically) but can't annul his wife since INC sila. He holds on to his faith with INC so much. Di nya kaya matiwalag. 

Nga pala, alam naman ng both families and relatives relasyon namin pero except sa church nya at sa pamilya ng asawa nya. As for me, maaga ako na biyuda kaya wala naman problem kung magpakasal ulit. Both kami never pa nagkaanak. My life was already full of challenges. Emotionally abused ako sa marriage ko and looks like si Lord ang gumawa ng way na makawala ako dun. And many more. 
Tapos ngayon, nakilala na namin ang isa't isa, sobrang pagmamahal nabibigay namin for each other. Masaya sya kasi kahit mataas pinagaralan ko (I'm doing PhD, he doesn't have bachelor's degree) and mas mataas ang estado sa buhay, I never looked down on him and I always have high regards for him. 

Mahirap iexplain kung gaano nakakahinayang yung love na papakawalan ko kasi alam namin na di na namin makikita yun sa iba. 

Btw, I chose to stay kasi sa ilang beses na muntik na din ako mamatay (lapitin ng accidents kasi) at nung December nabundol naman ako ng sasakyan, at sa dami ng obstacles na nalagpasan ko, I feel like I deserve na makuha yung love and happiness. 

Nakakalungkot we cannot be together because of so much complications ng batas ng tao at batas ng relihiyon niya. 
Pero kung tutuusin, wala na kami masasagasaan na tao kasi wala kaming anak, at wala na kaming ka relasyon. 

Please don't comment hurtful words, medyo nadedepress na ako at the moment. Sabi kasi ng friends ko hiwalayan mo na. Although sabi ng mga older colleagues ko, give it time.

Sana sa next lifetime, magkita kami at pwede na kami magmahalan ng walang complications.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1acrq6s/forbidden_perfect_love/,t2_si9xywk6i,2024-01-28 10:18:38,18,0
My husband blames me for EVERYTHING.,"He blames me for his depression. He was already troubled when we met and was diagnosed clinically depressed when I encouraged him to seek professional help. 

He blames me when can’t work. I know it’s depressing being alone, but what choice did we have? I didn’t want our child to live in a shack inside his shop. Call me maarte but it wasn’t a good neighborhood either and he often left us alone. 

He blames me for all the mental and emotional abuse I experienced from him. He can’t control his temper. Almost every word that I say is a trigger. I never cursed at him or called him names, or said hurtful things even when we had disagreements. I felt so worthless. He would often say that I am a useless wife. We were together for 6 years. For the last 3 years, I just kept quiet whenever we had arguments. It was still a trigger for him. 

He blames me for his bad financial decisions. He doesn’t tell me when he plans to invest on something. He just does it. It would ALWAYS come as a surprise and when these investments fail, he blames me. I don’t even touch his money. I don’t know how much he earns. 

He still blames me for the physical abuse I experience from him. We had a financial disagreement because I found out from his mom that he was planning to buy a vehicle with no papers. I just told him not to, in the calmest way. He still got it and hit me while I was carrying our baby. I called my parents to pick me up. Baby and I lived far from him for more than a year (and this was during the height of the pandemic) and he blames me for not witnessing our child grow up. I still forgave him for this and he got a house without my consent and we just had to move back because I didn’t want to waste it. 

He blames me for being alone. We lost our home. We lost our business because I couldn’t manage it well with a toddler. He just appointed me to manage it despite my objections. I was more concerned about our toddler’s health. It was the height of frequent lockdowns during this time. Our child and I had to move back to my parents” because we have no where to live and our debts racked up. I finished my own savings paying for his debts and our bills and needs. 

He blames me for being busy. I was able to find a good paying job and I’m slowly able to pay all our debts. He rarely provides financial support. I only get 3k every other month from him, while he was able to buy some “luho” and these are not cheap. If I don’t work., nothing gets paid on time. 

He blames me for ruining his life. He had dreams for us. I told him that I didn’t want to go back because there aren’t any good schools where we used to live. It was in the province. I can finally afford to send my child to an exclusive private school. Wouldn’t you want what’s best for your child? I was also worried about the toxic environment when we lived together. He would shout and curse at me in front of our child. 

He blames me for having low self-esteem. I just didn’t have the libido to have seggs because apart from taking care of our kid and managing our former business, I had to do ALL the chores. I was very, very tired. We used to have an active seggs life, but it dwindled down since I gave birth. I was also experiencing PPD. Every time we do it, I felt forced. He would often tell me that I don’t love him and that I wasn’t attracted to him anymore. He felt ugly. 

He recently called it quits and blamed it on me. He threatened that he would unalive himself and record it and leave messages to people blaming me because I was the reason for his misery. He would threaten me with this almost every week before we broke up. I agreed to the break up and he still had the nerve to blame me for quitting on him. He said that I didn’t deserve him. He said that I deserve someone who will cheat on me and physically abuse me. He thinks he’s perfect because he’s very faithful. 

He refuses to seek professional help. He used to see a psych and took meds for months, but decided to just stop. 

I am tired of all the mental and emotional abuse. He snaps almost everyday. 

All I was thinking of was the upbringing of our child. I didn’t want the kid to grow up in a toxic environment. I would often encourage him to seek professional help together, but he would just say hurtful things. He often said that I am a useless wife. 

Call me stupid for keeping up with all of this. I KNOW I AM. I really deserved what I tolerated, but enough is enough.

Don't go making children just to mess them up,"Please, guys. Don't go making children just to make them your retirement plan, emotional punching bag, trophy kid, display, paper dolls or whatever. Make kids and let them live the life they want.

&#x200B;

I am 27 now, unmarried (but in a long term relationship) and very messed up because of my parents. Walang pangarap sa buhay tatay ko nuong nagsasama pa sila ni Mama and lasinggero siya. My mom naman ay lalakero na egocentric, mentally abusive at hindi ako ang priority nuon. Lola ko lang dahilan kaya matino pa akong kausap ngayon. 

&#x200B;

As of now, ako retirement plan ni Papa at official mental punching bag ng mama ko. Magkahiwalay na sila matagal na. I also have sisters sa bagong pamilya ni Mama and sila rin ay emotional punching bag ng mama ko. 

&#x200B;

My dad lacks money, knowledge and dreams. I love him pero I hate how he put me into this predicament. My mom naman ay your usual toxic mom na egocentric na boomer. MAyaman sila ng asawa niya pero hindi ako priority ni mama. She'd rather support her siblings than me.

&#x200B;

Pagod na ako. Araw araw gigising ako bakit ganito kamessed up ginawa nila sakin. I dont want anyone to turn like me... so please... nurture your kids. PLEASE. JUST PLEASE.

Gusto ko nang mawala. Di na ko gagaling,"

27M here. Mayroon po akong MDR TB at wala po ako work now.  
Only child lang po ako. Mama ko lang nagpalaki sa akin. Bata pa lang ako iniwan na kami nang papa ko para sa kabit niya. I grew up without a father figure, mama ko lang nagpalaki sa kin. Nagbibigay naman siya kaso sobrang kulang and nun nagkaroon na siya nang anak dun sa kabet niya. Wala na talaga.

Since pinahinto ako mag aral. I fell into depression and lagi lang ako nakakulong sa kwarto ko having su\*cidal thoughts. Dahil wala rin kami pambayad nang renta napalayas kami nang mama ko sa inuunapahan namin at nakanap nang sobrang liit na upahan.

Nagkaroon ako nang contracture. Sabi nang doctor malaki chance na di na ko uli makakalad kahit i surgery pa. Over 1 year mahigit na kong baldado and dahil dun nag work yung mom since wala na tlaga sustento.

My grew up with a silver spoon and wala talaga siya alam na trabaho and for me nag work siya para mabuhay lang kami. Di kinaya nang mom ko yung stress sa work at yung situation ko na disabled na ko. Namatay yung mama ko for unknown cause. Pabago bago sinasabi nang doctor sabi nung una tb pero paiba iba. Namatay mama ko sa inuupahan namin habang may sakit at baldado ako. 2019 ito

  
Kinuha ako nang papa ko nung namatay mama ko. Emotionally abusive papa ko and di ko kaya makisama sa kabit niya at mga anak nun. Kaya when I was miraculously cured without any medical intervention 4 months after mamatay mom ko. Nag work ako and umalis dun.

  
I was living alone and I was trying to to become the best version of myself and fix mylife. Fast forward around 2022 ma promote ako sa team manager pero yung sahod pang ahente pa rin. Sa sobrang focus ko sa work. Nabayaan ko health ko.

  
After few months tinamaan ako nang tb. Di ko ine expect kasi di nman ako sakitin and kahit nung lahat nagka covid na sa office di ako nagkaroon. Kaya nung sumusuka ako nang dugo at naging 38kg ako kala ko kukunin na ako.

  
I mesaaged my father to reconcile with him thinking maybe he wasn't that bad at all and at least pag n\*matay ako ililibing ako katabi ko mama ko.

  
I was in the ICU for a month and I didn't d\*e but now I need to be on oxygen for 24/7. I can't afford that.  
My father is abusing me emotionally and physically. Sabi niya mam@tay na lang daw ako nag try pa siya balian ako nung buto nung nagpupumilit ako magpala sa hospital dahil sobrang hirap kuna huminga. Di lang yan instance niya na sinaktan ako.

  
In and out ako sa hospital. Last time pinalabas ako nang hospital kahit wala pa ako oxygen sa bahay and sabi ban na daw ako dahil wala pambayad. Wag daw magpala sa hospital pag wala pambayad.

  
Wala may trabaho sa min. Matagal na tambay papa ko since pandemic wala siya work. Ang may work lang is yung kabet niya and pag may pera pinangsusugal lang.

  
Nakikitira ako ngayon sa kabit nang papa ko. Di ko na a adhere yung gamutan sa tb since di nman ako makakain maayos and sobrang hapdi sa tiyan nang tb meds pag walang kain not to mention other side effects.

  
Ngayon di na naman ako makahinga at ubo nang ubo at panay suka. Di ko alam kung pwede ako i admit nang mag isa lang lalo wala akong pambayad. Wala akong work. Di ko na alam gagawin ko. May onting lakas pako ang nakakalad pa ako di tulad nang mga last admission ko.  I was thinking the best way to exit painlessly and fast. Dun ko na lang uubsin huling lakas ko. Kung binasa mo lahat.

Zoning out in mid-convos,"I am mid-20s, I was a post-survivor of mental and abusive trauma from friends, old flames and parents.

Mejo naging habit ko na pakalmahin sarili ko this past few years when I get trigerred and panicking.

Although, minsan I found myself zoning out in mid-convos lalo na pag disappointing or sad yung kinukwento ng tao (also doing the finger-pressing) Sometimes, I am wondering if I am surpressing things para di ko mafeel to and just trying to protect my emotional and mental state.

abusive parent who threatens to s*ic*d*,"No child or partner should ever go through the experience of dealing with an abusive, narcissistic, manipulative parent. 

It's one of those nights again the whole family has to deal with a parent who threatens to unalive themselves over all these thoughts they project onto the rest of the family.

They feel unappreciated? That's because they've been verbally abusing everybody for pretty much all their lives then they act so confused as to why none of us shows affection. Treats them like trash because they don't have a job? That's their personal insecurities they project onto us when literally nobody treats them like so. We're unhelpful in the house? That's because we're constantly walking on eggshells when they switch from i dont need help gusto ko kayong pagsilbihan to putangina mga anak mayaman ba kayo. They feel that we dont listen and respect them? Honestly, at this point we don't anymore. Why would we do that when the parent doesn't listen, invalidates the effect of their abuse on us, and yet claims to be the victim and that everybody does nothing but hurt them. 

Living with an abusive parent is hell that those who didn't experience it HAVE NO FUCKING RIGHT to say ""we understand"", ""that's still your parent"" or ""you're an awful person for being angry towards them.""

The trauma, the lies, these nights where u have to restrain your abuser from unaliving themselves and then listen to all their hurt and pain but when they inflict the abuse to you, they justify it with various excuses. 

No child, husband or wife should ever go through this. The manipulation and guilt-tripping is cruel. 

If you've reached this point, i hope u dont marry to a person who is emotionally immature and just downright awful. Because when yall have kids, no child should have to parent their own parent and deal with all their emotional baggages. Kasi sa huli, pag dumating sa punto na gusto na nila mawala, dadalhin nyo yung guilt na kasalanan nyo pero ang totoo, desisyon naman talaga nila gawin lahat ng ginawa nila. 

You'd think I'd be angry at them for being like this. But honestly, im indifferent. They can do whatever they want, i honestly don't care. I'm more angry how the people i love around me isn't as detached as i am so they're still getting hurt.

Bound by Control,"It is challenging to make my mother, who is conservative and authoritarian, understand that I am growing up and have my own life to live.

She believes that since I still live under her roof, I have no right to make demands, dismissing everything I say as mere excuses and bluffs. She has built a wall between us, seeing me only as her daughter and herself as the mother.

My best friend is still in love with her abusive ex and I don't know what to do anymore,"***tl;dr***: My friend still loves her abusive ex even though she's already in a loving, committed relationship and I don't know how to help her. It's frustrating to constantly give advice to someone who doesn't recognize that they were a victim of abuse and refuses to get help for it.

Alam niyo yung feeling pag kayo yung go-to ng friend/s mo for advice, tipong kahit single ka sayo pumupunta for relationship advice? 😂 I have no issues with this, often I'm single by choice; pwedeng dahil nakipag-break with someone who was being controlling, or stopped seeing someone whom I knew I wasn't going to ""love"".

Basically, they come to me kasi ako daw yung ""strong"" samin, ako yung alam kung pano titigil pag awat na (so ako yung tatandang dalaga hahaha).

So I have a best friend whom I love so much, but puta ang tanga tanga niya sa pag-ibig?

I've been best friends with this girl since high school. I've supported her with every relationship she had while we were growing up.

Then in college, she got into a relationship where she was the mistress — she found out months into the relationship na engaged pala si guy with a long-term gf; the guy insisted na si best friend yung mahal niya and they were engaged because of their families, but he was going to break it off once gumraduate sila ng college (spoiler alert: he did not).

Eventually, she met this new guy (around 5 years older than us — successful, tall, dark and handsome, family guy, prince charming kumbaga) and it seemed like he was perfect. And she was able to move on with his help. She saw him as her knight in shining armor.

Out of the frying pan... and into the fire.

**TRIGGER WARNING**: Emotional and physical abuse below. (I could go into so much detail about this guy and his abusiveness, but I'm not sure about sharing it since it's not really my story to tell, so snippet lang for now.)

The guy became abusive. Emotionally at first, then eventually physically. The guy worked abroad so di ito immediately naging obvious. It came to light when he had to stay in the country for several months; he stayed with her and the abuse got worse and physical, and the emotional abuse did not stop even pag-alis niya. He cheated on her on-and-off (the magic of social media is no side-chicks ever stays secret for long). He would pick fights then gaslight her. He would control her day and chastise her like a kid until she begs and answers the way he wants her to. Eventually, he forced her to cut us (most of her non-classmate friends) off. We only got in touch with her again and found out where he moved her nung nakapag-abroad na si guy and she had to reach out to us through her dad's account, and later a dummy account.

Whenever she came close to snapping enough to break up with him, he would beg for her back.

And she forgave him constantly. They lasted 5+ years. Pucha.

Believe me, we called the guy out. We tried to talk some sense into her. Kaso sabi ko nga, she was so *~~tanga~~* head over heels for this guy. When I found out about him hitting her, I wanted to report it so bad, to tell someone. Tell her dad at least. She begged me not to, insisting na minor lang naman pananakit niya.

Sadly, when we eventually told her dad (so that he would stop convincing her to take him back nung nanunuyo ulit siya)... medyo traditonalist dad niya and didn't see the fault in it much, just said he was disappointed *but* that the guy had done 'so much' for her — hoping this helps you see how good this guy is at playing people; he looks so nice and charming to people on the outside, and ang tendency is siya yung kakampihan and si girl yung sinisisi pag nag-aaway sila).

When they did eventually break up, nagpakasasa as single dude etong si guy and jumped from girl to girl. Eventually though, the guy asked for her back, saying he was going to change (*eye roll*). This has happened before and lagi siyang bumibigay. Luckily, she met this guy at work that seemed really decent and had all the qualities she was looking for in a man. Jackpot, di ba? Well...

I guess when she started saying No, he saw it as a challenge and worked harder to get her back. He actually returned to the Philippines for a while to woo her. And she was starting to fall for it again. Syempre, damage control kami ng friends niya. These two guys seemed to be one-upping each other for her attention, and god fucking damn it abusive ex was winning because of all their memories. The only reason she ended up not choosing her ex was because we found out that he had a ""backup girl"". She tried to defend him and said ""panakip butas"" lang yung isang girl, but we let her see otherwise.

This was around 5 years ago. She's now engaged to her (former) officemate, she's super close to his family, we know him well and he seems genuinely good (for a while, she was sort of the emotionally abusive one, parang yung mga ginawa sa kanya ng ex niya na pagiging controlling, nababalik niya kay new bf, who would call or go to us crying sometimes; we called her out on this and this eventually stopped).

We haven't seen each other in a while since the pandemic started, and when we finally did last weekend... she confessed that she was still stalking her ex. She says she thinks and dreams about him often. She's haunted by ""what-ifs"" and flat out said that if her ex were to woo her again, she's sure it would take little convincing for her to take him back.

Naiiyak ako. I love my friend, ***pero puta bakit ang tanga tanga niya***?

I told her that she was a victim of abuse. He made her so dependent on him at one point na until now, parang hinahanap hanap niya pa din siya. She still hasn't recovered and looks like she'll need help, kasi our words aren't helping. Paulit ulit lang kami. She refuses to believe this (and I get that people who are abused don't recognize it sadly; it's been so long though so akala ko goods na siya). She just says na ""Minahal ko eh"" and that he helped her so much and they'd been through so much together.

Our mutual friend informed me na pauwi si guy next month. And I'm nervous as fuck.

Advice welcome. Baka may alam kayong therapist na pwedeng tumulong dito, yung chill lang kausap para pumayag na siya finally mag-therapy.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/ui0may/my_best_friend_is_still_in_love_with_her_abusive/,t2_gnyimaue,2022-05-04 14:52:01,1,7
Consider yourself blessed if you do not have to deal with an abusive parent,"Daming bagay na kinikimkim ko lang sa sarili ko mula bata ako kasi hindi naman pwedeng ikwento sa iba dahil sa ""background"" ng pamilya. Iniingatan ang reputasyon. Hindi pwedeng malaman ng iba na may nangyayaring family drama. Naalala ko, elementary pa ako sinabihan ako ng nanay ko na huwag ikwento sa mga kaklase ko kung may nangyayari mang gulo sa bahay. Kaya itinago ko lahat yun sa sarili ko. Naiintindihan ko naman bakit hindi pwede e.

Siguro college na ako nung una akong may napagkwentuhan na hindi perpekto ang pamilya ko. Noon ko rin unang nakwento sa iba ang analysis ko why I became who I am. Siguro sinisi ko rin ang magulang ko kung bakit ako naging ganito – cold, heartless, matigas. Pero wala na akong magagawa, ganito na ako. Tinanggap ko na lang. Di naman ako nagtanim ng galit sa magulang ko. Alam ko di naman din sila perpekto. Nung narealize ko yun, ako na lang ang nag-""parent"" sa sarili ko. Pinakauna kong narealize to grade 3 pa lang ako. Di na ko nagkikwento sa magulang ko ng kahit ano for fear that I might either upset them or I will just be invalidated again. Kaya mga problema, ako na lang umiisip ng solusyon. Kung takot ako, ako rin nagpapalakas ng loob ko. Kung malungkot ako, ako rin ang nag-aahon sa sarili ko.

My physiological and financial needs were taken care of, but my emotional needs weren't. I'm not ungrateful but I wish my emotional needs were taken into consideration too.

Nanay ko, emotionally abusive mula bata pa ako. Ang trauma nya nung lumalaki sya, sa akin naproject. Tangina, ako pa ngayon nag-aanalyze sa kanya para maintindihan ko sya. Pero di ko na talaga sya kaya. Lumaki syang sunud-sunuran sa magulang nya kasi yun daw ang pagiging ""mabuting anak."" Kahit sa aasawahin nya, magulang nya nagdesisyon para sa kanya. Hindi rin sya marunong magdesisyon para sa sarili. She's the most fickle-minded person I know. Pabago-bago ng iniisip, pabago-bago ng desisyon, ang daming nasasayang na oras. Kaya ganun din ang ginagawa nya sa akin, lahat ng gusto nya dapat sunud-sunuran lang ako. Pag hindi ako sumunod, hindi ako mabuting anak. Isa sa mga di ko makakalimutan na pagiging emotionally abusive nya ay sabihan ako na mamamatay na raw sya, para lang makita nya akong umiyak. Pag naiisip ko yun ngayon, tangina, naiisip ko anong klaseng magulang ang magsasabi nun?

In 2020, dahil sa pandemic, I had to go back sa bahay namin dahil baka mag-apocalypse na. I was living independently for seven years before that. I was comfortable and happy with my life. I enjoyed freedom. Siguro one of my biggest regrets in life was returning back home. Nawalan ako ng trabaho. Pagbalik sa bahay, kinukulit nya ako maghanap ng trabaho. Hanap naman ako nang hanap, pero hindi natatanggap. Inisip ko sana di na lang ako bumalik kung paghahanapin lang din ako ulit ng trabaho kasi may trabaho naman ako nun e. Sobrang lala ng 2020, I only found comfort sa thought na I can end it anytime by killing myself.

Ngayon naman, one week after I failed the Bar Exam, I have to deal with this shit again. While waiting for the results, I thought I'd just kill myself if I don't pass. Ngayon buhay ako, pero I have to deal with my abusive nagger mother again. Ni hindi man lang ako binigyan ng time and space to grieve. Gusto nya makita lang ako ulit na nag-aaral. Putangina lang no. Nakakainggit yung ibang nagtake tapos sabi nila niyakap lang daw sila ng nanay nila nung nalaman na di sila pumasa. Buti pa sila. Ako sinisi ng magulang ko e. Tapos ngayon bawat galaw ko mino-monitor, bawal makita na gumagamit ng phone. E wala  nga akong makausap na matino at naiintindihan ako maliban sa mga taong nakakausap ko sa phone. Kung di dahil sa mga nakakausap kong kaibigan, baka nagpakamatay na lang ako.

Gusto ko na talaga umalis dito. Ang hirap lang dahil ang dami pang kailangang iconsider. Ang hirap sabihin sa akin na, ""umalis ka na lang"" kasi hindi naman ganun kadali yun. Fuck. Ang komplikado ng buhay ko. Buhay ako pero di ko maramdaman na ako ang nagpapatakbo ng sarili kong buhay. Ang tanda ko na. I already finished two degrees. Pero walang kwenta ang buhay ko. Mas marami ka pang maririnig na masama sa mga tao kapag nasa kalugmukan ka talaga kaysa pag nagtatagumpay ka.

Siguro bilib na lang ako na di ganun kasidhi ang kagustuhan ko ngayon na magpakamatay na lang. Although sa totoo lang yun na talaga ang totoong sagot sa lahat ng problema ko. Pero at least, di ko pa ginagawa kahit alam ko na kung paano ko gagawin.

Tangina tapos parang di pa pwedeng sumama ang loob ko. Parang I'm made to feel guilty pag galit ako. Pag tahimik, pinipilit magsalita. Pag nagsalita, di rin naman naiintindihan. Putangina. Alam ko naman kasi anong dapat maging takbo ng buhay ko e. Alam ko kung paano aayusin ang buhay ko. Ang problema: wala akong kalayaang gawin agad kung ano ang plano ko. Laging nakadepende sa external circumstances.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/12tkf6j/consider_yourself_blessed_if_you_do_not_have_to/,t2_ugb3qkq0,2023-04-21 08:25:24,9,5
as a tired friend na akisma,"pagod na me maging available sa friend kong tumatawag or mag chachat lang pag nag away ng jowa nyang abuser. she has a history of depression and she said parang it's coming back dahil dito sa jowa nya na di nya kaya hiwalayan kahit ginagawa na syang punching bag physically and emotionally. she'll call when im working kahit tambak na ako ng workload kakausapin ko muna sya ending mapapa OT ako pag ok na sya she will not reply to my messages asking if how's she doing na. 

this morning while im asleep, nag chat sya and pet peeve ko talaga ang mga nag chachat ng walang context or tatawagin ka muna sa chat.  pagod na pagod ako sa work this week dahil 3 nag resign sa amin so bigat ng workload isang week 2-4 hrs OT. so tulog pa ako mga teh nagising ako ng freaking 5AM dahil sa tawag nya pag sagot ko umiiyak na naman ang gaga. this time, nag sorry ako dahil gusto kong magpahinga dahil ako pagod na pagod na rin ako sa life and wala naman akong mapagsasabihan so di ko na kaya pa mag accommodate pa ng problema ng iba.

most of my friends are like that. ako pa mag aaya sa mga tropa ko pag may isa kaming friend na sad but pag ako nag aaya sa kanila na di ko sasabihin na ""kasi malungkot si ganito"" no one's available. very relate ako sa certain lyrics talaga nung song na Maps na ""I was there for you in your darkest times
I was there for you in your darkest night. But I wonder, where were you? When I was at my worst down on my knees. And you said you had my back. So I wonder, where were you?""

Im afraid I’m a narcissist and it’s ruining my life.,"Somethings wrong with me and I don’t know what that is.

Recently I’ve been good at battling my anxiety and my thoughts, but right now it’s attacking me and I’m not sure what to do. For the past month I’ve been convinced I’m a narcissist and that I feel no empathy or guilt, I’ve learned everything about them and I can’t stop subconsciously comparing myself to what I’ve read. My body is consumed with cold sweats, I can’t stop shaking, and I’m getting easily agitated because my mind don’t stop telling me how much of a bad person I must be. Every thought I think is always questioned by my head, every action I do is questioned by my head, and I’m not sure what to do anymore. Every thing I do my head comes and tells me “are you being narcissistic? Are you doing this for attention? You’re probably manipulating them. Maybe you should run away from everyone so you don’t run the risk of hurting anyone ever again.” I’ve even gone as far as asking family members and friends if traits of narcissism fit me, and they all say no. My therapist even says in incredibly introspective and a good person, but some part of me fears that I tricked her into thinking that and in reality I must be a bad person. She’s told me that I tend to put others emotions/feelings before my own, and it’s caused me to not know who I am or how I feel, and that I tend to worry more about the feelings of other people even when they’re abusing me. She often says “facts over feelings” because apparently I’ll end up empathizing with my abuser or at least worrying more about how they’ll react than about my safety, and I struggle to leave abusive relationships and even attract them somehow, or abusive people are attracted to something about me. I’ve been told many times by my abusers that I’m incapable of anything, that I’m weak and don’t do anything, that I never tell them anything, etc. Some part of me worries that they’re right. I’ve even been so convinced they were right that I apologized to them for reacting to their abuse, yet somehow I’m still convinced i must be at least a covert narcissist. It’s tearing me up so much that I don’t know what else to do and just spend all day shaking and crying and in bed worrying that i’m a bad person. thank you for listening, any and all insight or advice will be appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/18arhue/im_afraid_im_a_narcissist_and_its_ruining_my_life/,t2_nijwsth8,2023-12-05 03:06:06,1,1
Normalize asking nga muna if okay lang mag dump ng kashitan ng buhay,"Putangina. Putangina lang talaga sagad. 

Sorry pero tanginang hindi ko magawang maging mabuti munang tao at bigyan ka ng simpatya dahil sa mga kaputanginahang nangyari sayo sa buhay. 

Putangina for dumping your rants sa life, stories of the abuses, rape, and how shitty your life is. 

Wala akong enough mental capacity to take those shits rn, pero to dump it all on me. Isahan. Tuloy-tuloy. Walang preno. Biglaan. 

Putangina pero mukha ba akong mentally and emotionally okay and ready?!

I KNOW THEY ARE ALL SERIOUS MATTERS. 

PERO FUCK. 

Sana ugaliin muna to ask permission if okay lang ba yung taong makakareceive no'n. 

Now, I am crying hard kasi hindi ko kinakaya yung bigat na naipasa sa akin just from reading your chats and kwento. 

Now, nanginginig ako and mentally and emotionally drained kasi hindi ko kaya yung mga kwento mo. 

Tangina talaga kasi yung pagiging oversharer mo walang kinikilalang boundaries ng ibang tao. 

I am emotionally and mentally triggered ngayon and hindi ako makafunction kahit na ang dami ko pa need gawin. 

Putangina talaga. Di ko alam kung gumaan pakiramdam mo or what, pero tangina kasi ako naman nagsusuffer ngayon. 

Pare-pareho lang naman tayo pinuputangina ng buhay. 

Hindi mo kailangan doblehin yung sa iba.

Hindi lahat okay na makareceive ng rants and serious problems ng iba. Hindi lahat mentally and emotionally ready and okay to become a listener and receiver. 

Tangina. I feel paralyzed. I feel drained. I feel triggered. 

Wala na lang ako magawa kundi umiyak.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/15rlli9/normalize_asking_nga_muna_if_okay_lang_mag_dump/,t2_9flfr7sh,2023-08-15 15:31:13,23,2
Internet provider,"Hanggang ngayon mejo naluluha pa rin ako. I am 25 F
So eto na nga, Wala kaming net for 3 days na and Iam working from home. So kahapon pinuntahan ko yung internet provider dito sa area namin to ask what's going on and to askk kung dededuct ba yung araw na wala kaming net kasi nagloload ako. Nung turn ko na sa customer service, I asked nicely sa customer service rep kung ano gagawin kasi nga mejo mabigat yung binabayad ko sa load para sa work ko everyday. So si Kuya baka pagod na den anc stressed out kasi christmas party nila kahapon mejo tumaas na yung boses sakin, I heard it like a roaring sound na I guess he is in his late 30's and 6ft tall. Di ko namalayan tears started to flow in my eyes and everyone was staring at us na.Na tulala ako, then there's this feeling na naawa ako sa sariliko. Just to let you know I was physically and emotionally abused by my mom nung bata ako and meron akong PWD ID because of some mental issues that I am experiencing. 

sabi nya pa 
"" ay maam, may connection man o wala babayaran nyo pa rin yan. ganun talaga, kung walang 7 days na may outage sa area di namin i hohonor yan"" 

Earlier today may unknown number na tumawag, sinagot ko and narinig ko yung nakakatakot na boses. I started to cry again. Ewan. Na trauma siguro ako. OA no. 

 So yung internet ko di pa rin naayos gang ngayon load load parin. I guess wala namang kwenta yung sinasabi ko, nag vevent out lang ako. wala namaan akong mapag sabihan. ang OA ko talaga, but thankyou kung binabasa mo pa rin to. 😮‍💨",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/18jk15b/internet_provider/,t2_pmap6gd3l,2023-12-16 13:20:06,0,2
I might breakup with my GF already dahil sa attitude niya kahit siya yung may kasalanan. Will even use sex as an escape route para hindi siya maging accountable sa actions niya.,"EDIT POST BELOW:
MAY EDIT AKO ULIT:

To cut the story short, my gf never learned the art of accountability. There's a time na di kami naging okay at nagpa confide siya sa kaopisina niyang lalake na pinagdududahan ko na since day 1.

She admitted na this guy confessed to her and wala naman daw sakanya yon dahil ""natutuwa"" lang naman siya na may napapag openan siya na open din sakanya at binibigyan siya ng comfort na kailangan niya. In short, hinanap niya sa iba yung nakukuha niya sakin hahahaha i know, technically cheating, right? Ngayon nag cutout na daw siya ng communications and connection niya don sa lalake dahil gusto niya daw workout rel'n namin.

So what recently happened is nag advise siya na kasama niya mga kaopisina niyang guys na magjojog this Saturday. I immediately asked sino kasama. 4 guys and one of them is the guy na sinasabi ko. I felt slightly uncomfortable. So I thought of testing her by saying na kung pwede ako sumama just to see her reaction but I don't actually wanna go. She reacted in pure discomfort and out of frustration. Wag daw muna at lakad niya daw yun with her co-workers and magbobond daw sila. Di ko magets logic niya don haha. 

Ayoko na. Currently taking therapy na dahil grabe yung emotional toll na caused sakin ng jowa ko. I'm diagnosed with anxiety and mild depression. Samahan niya daw ako mag heal pero hanggang ngayon ganon pa din siya. She doesn't even adjust sa mga bagay na possible makapagpa trigger sakin. Kasi kung talagang she's concerned, di siya sasama don knowing na andun yung lalake at alam niyang magiging uncomfortable ako. Pero wala. Andun pa din siya sa ""Wala namang malisya sakin eh.""

Kung andito ka at nababasa mo to, putangina mo at ng kabit mo. Magfofocus ako sa healing ko. Sana nakinig nalang ako sa pamilya ko about you. Fucking bitch with no contentment. 

Edit: For those who are asking saang part yung sex as an escape route, I can better explain this by giving a scenario: Last night naging uncomfortable nako sa paalam niyang jog with guy co-workers and a guy na nag confide sakanya. We live together. Natulog kami kagabi ng di magkayakap at di nag usap. About midnight, ginigising niya ako at attempted to suck my meat. I hardly said no at dumapa ako para di niya mapilit. Umalis siya ng bahay sabi niya papasok nalang siya ng maaga then pumunta sa kotse niya. Before therapy, hahabulin ko yon at pipigilan umalis. But this time, natuto nako. Di ko siya hinabol at hinayaan ko siya. A few minutes passed, nagchat siya saying ulit na ""papasok nalang ako ng maaga kasi di rin naman ako makakapag pahinga jan"". I completely ignored her and went back to sleep. A few minutes ulit, I heard the door open and she went back to our room. Saying na bakit daw ba ako ganito or bat ganto mood ko. I explained to her and nagsorry siya tas sabi niya about dun sa pagsama ko sa jogging nila ""problema kasi sayo pag may gusto ka, gusto mo mangyayari agad."" well that's not my point. I did not respond and went silent for a while. She grabbed my dck once again and went down to attempt sucking it. I hardly said No pa din. I'm saying no dahil alam ko nanaman to. Idadaan sa sex then sa mga susunod na pangyayare, she won't even treat me lightly na kumbaga ""may kasalanan ako sa taong to kaya need ko bumawi"" na ganon man lang. The next hour around 5:30, sabi niya aalis na daw siya. Sabi ko okay ingat pero sabi niya ""Pero fuck me first"" kakagising ko lang non. Ayaw ko pa nung una pero nalead on din ako in the end. So yeah, the sex happened. Nung nakaalis na siya, we talked about her wrecked car na papaayos sa tropa ko. Sabi ko bumili na siya nung emblem ng kotse niya para maganda tignan. She responded with ""wala pa akong pera. bat di mo muna ako tanungin kung may pambili ako? di mo kasi iniisip yung gastos"" which is nabastusan ako. Like,,, nakikisama na nga ako at pinababa pride ko dahil may atraso pa siya sakin pero ganon siya kabastos mag respond. Porke ba nafuck ko na siya, okay na ulit? Bakit, ayun lang ba kailangan ko sakanya? I'm a man pero I'm not fueled by any kind of pussy. I'm pissed then binanggit ko sakanya yun na siya na nga may atraso pero ganon niya ako tinatrato. She did not replied after that. Next pm niya mag oot daw siya which i doubt. She'll just be with that guy. Fuck both of them. Bukas, papalayasin ko na yun dito sa bahay ko. Kung wala lang akong trabaho ngayong araw eh.

EDIT 2.0: Nagkaron na kami ng conversation about breaking up sa messenger. Before, sasabihin ko na pag usapan muna namin. Just to give you guys context, any form of inconvenience, tampuhan etc., she tend to leave and nakikipag break. And ako naman, tendency humahabol ako kasi mahal ko siya. But this time, I just let her be. Idk kung itutuloy niya yun o hindi and she even mentioned na di siya uuwi tonight. Di ko naman malalaman dahil wala nako sa bahay mamayang gabi at nasa opisina nako. Imposible ding umuwi siya sakanila dahil nandito lahat ng gamit niya at may pasok siya kinabukasan. Honestly guys, I feel a bit weak. I don't know if I can do it. I posted it here in a way na para akong nagising sa katangahan at nagmamatapang pero deep inside, I still wanna keep her. I'm sorry if disappoints everyone and I know na nagmukha tuloy clownery post ko. Pero ayun, alam ng soul ko na dapat na akong bumitaw at umalis pero my heart, mind and flesh as a whole says no. But thank you guys for the comments you've made. I believe na in the soon future, magagamit ko yan to muster up my courage to get out of this emotionally abusive relationship. I hope I find the light as go through my therapy. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1c20usl/i_might_breakup_with_my_gf_already_dahil_sa/,t2_ax59m2is,2024-04-12 13:07:37,193,75
Birthday ko din,"To preface, birthday ko today. [24F]

Last night, my parents asked me what I want for my bday celebration. Haven't thought much about my bday nung papalapit na kasi di ko feel magcelebrate sa dami ng iniisip ko, but last night I was open to the idea ng handa dahil pinush din ako primarily ng mama ko.

Ayoko na kasi ng gastos, at most probably ako ang magluluto (gusto ko naman magluto, I love cooking for my family) but hindi ko lang talaga feel yung idea of celebrating my bday, ang gastos din kasi. My partner also said na magcelebrate nalang daw kami sa dinner na kaming dalawa, treat nya.

So we were talking and I was starting to get excited about it, naisip ko na gusto ko kainin ganyan kaya lang my mom kept saying ""Birthday ko din"" kasi daw she's the one who gave birth to me. At first tinatry ko ibrush off, until nagsusuggest na sya ng mga gusto NYA.

Brinush off ko initially hanggang sa tuloy tuloy sya sa pag suggest ng gusto nya, even invalidating yung gusto ko mangyari.

Sabi ko parang gusto ko ng something shrimp pasta, sabi nya 'hindi ba tayo magkakaallergy nyan?' As if walang shrimp sa gusto nyang food.  Even following up na kaya daw ganon sya sa shrimp dahil allergic daw yung partner ko sa shrimp (?) Which I find distasteful kasi halatang naghahanap nalang sya reason to save face. Also: WALANG MAY ALLERGY SA AMIN NG SHRIMP

Ngayon lang, nabring up na naman yung usapan so I got upset and told them to just do whatever they want. I feel like an asshole for reacting how I reacted. Pero nakakainis at nakakatampo, why bother asking me what I want kung gusto nya sya masunod?

I understand she's getting old but damn it's so draining. I want to claim emotional abuse at guilt tripping pero hay ewan.

Siguro nga para sa kanila na lang to, pero what's the point of asking me what I want diba? Ganto din sinabi ko last time, na aalis din naman ako sa dinner kaya kung gusto nila magluto at kung ano nalang gusto nilang kainin, go na lang. It seems pretty childish but if you know my mom and how she speaks kapag nagiinsinuate sya ng gusto nyang mangyari ewan ko na lang.

Added context: weeks before my bday (wc is actually roughly 2 weeks after her's) sabi ko ayoko na maghanda at magpamigay ng pagkain sa kapitbahay gaya ng ginagawa nila. Sabi nya sakin 'Pano naman kami dito? Kung ayaw mo magcelebrate pano kami dito?'",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1aks1tm/birthday_ko_din/,t2_2qyr693q,2024-02-07 10:27:03,1,0
What being a victim of SA at a young age REALLY looks like,"Throaway account for obvious reasons. Maybe I want to be judged, but I'm going to confess things I can never even say out loud alone. A year ago, nagspeak up ako about this particular experience sa close friends ko sa IG. A lot of people called me ""brave"" and ""strong, but if they only knew what went behind the scenes I know they would look at me in a different way. I won't go into detail about the assault years ago, but basically I was the product of a teenage pregnancy--my parents then had to work their ass off para makakita ng pera so we had to stay at this extra small room na nirerentahan nila from a family friend. Said family friend na sobrang tanda na, literally with college children already, groomed me back then everyday paggaling sa school to sit on his lap para payagan niya raw akong kumuha ng kahit ilang candy sa tindahan nila, while he put his hands where it shouldn't whilst I was still wearing my preschool uniform. I was only 4 years old and was starved back then. He took advantage of that.  May kasambahay din kami that time (who also beat me to shreds) na suspected kabit nya kaya pinagkakatiwalaan akong ipaalaga sakanya everytime wala parents ko. 

Fast forward to when I was 6 years old and medyo nakapagipon ipon na sila papa, we finally had our own place. In those 2 years, I already knew something was wrong with what that man did to me but I wasn't wise enough as a child to interpret and cope with that in a healthy way. Instead, I turned out to be really hypersexual. I just recently realized how fucked up everything was back then. For instance, I would comfort myself with sexual thoughts involving older men whenever my parents would beat me or when I cannot go to sleep. I also developed some kind of an Oedipus Complex where I was sexually attracted with my father. I discovered orgasm whilst rubbing his used underwear down there. Even with my relatives na basta older men pagiisipan ko nang kung anu-ano behind the doors. I would also deliberately dress in skimpy clothes and even wore a sanitary napkin when I haven't even had my period yet just to feel like a woman. 

Eventually, I became sexually active at the age of 13. I developed really early and was admittedly attractive, even as a teenager. I liked the attention even sa mga tambay sa kanto, I would fucking get turned on from it like a sick fuck. I lost my virginity with a man who I met sa omegle who KNEW i was 13, while skipping a class. It was a fetish then to get fucked while wearing a uniform.  I've stopped hating myself for my decisions back then, but looking back, I just wish someone could've saw right through me and what was really going on. I excelled academically but had an attitude problem. I had to be kicked out for bullying hanggang sa palipat lipat ako ng school and slowly got addicted to alcohol. Nalayo na rin loob ko sa parents ko as they were also physically and emotionally abusive + pent up anger for neglecting when I was younger. 

Of course, all of this manifested to toxic relationships with borderline unhinged sex. I knew I was more genuinely attracted with women and felt more emotional connection but for some reason I only pursued relationships with men. It came to the point na nagiging abusive na ako sa boyfriend ko that time, I wanted him to be really rough to the point na gusto ko talagang magpass out, and not even for sexual pleasure alone. I wanted him to feel really bad and got off from the emotional abuse it caused. Once, I made him do something I would never forgive myself for, I made him do self harm after I forced him to cut me and fucking masturbated to it.

I was going insane but no one suspected a thing. My fuckups were considered just a phase I was going through hanggang nasanay nalang sila. It backfired syempre nyng nakita ni mama conversations namin . It was messy as hell and I was constantly being reminded of what I did, mom ko pa mismo nagchismis hanggang sa relatives ko. I was already contemplating death by suicide.Humingi ako help from my relatives to refer me to a Psychiatrist. I was then diagnosed with Bipolar 1 w/psychosis and was deemed clinically depressed. I tried na kausapin ulit mom ko and finally admit what happened 14 years ago as I slowly got better but I should've learned my lesson firsthand to not trust my mom. I was called a liar, of course, it's been 14 years bakit ngayon ko lang sasabihin? She told me I was using it as an excuse sa kababuyan ko raw. I made her words my gospel back then as I was filled with so much shame, I had to stop school temporarily and ghosted everyone, which eventually led to losing my already flimsy friendships. 

Nung nag 18 na ako saka ako nagdecide to speak up sa close friends ko lang sa IG about what really happened and confronted the pedophile from 14 years ago. I waited till I turned an adult para lahat ng decision ko onwards would solely be blamed unto me. Of course the bastard denied my statements. Of fucking course the bastard contacted my mother but I couldn't care less anymore. Sabi niya nakakahiya, immoral at walang utang na loob, wala naman daw akong laban kung gusto ko mangdemanda at hindi niya ako kakampihan. Ni hindi ko naman gusto umabot sa demandahan, I really just wanted closure. I got some support from friends pero I neglected all of it again and shut off from the world. 

Ngayon wala, I just feel really empty. I've abstained from my previous actions pero there are still times na those disgusting thoughts would devour me and I couldn't stop it, I feel like I would never feel genuine love as I do not have the capability to do so myself. My whole personality changed and I'm not sure I'm liking it but at least it was less of a mess than before. Everyone in my life right now are basically new set of people and all they really know about me is that I'm someone reliable and kind. God, if they only knew. Sorry for the really long post, dunno if anyone would even bother to read all this but at least I got if off my chest, for now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/186ugp9/what_being_a_victim_of_sa_at_a_young_age_really/,t2_owvbp7t4b,2023-11-30 01:08:52,8,3
I HATE MYSELF,"F(16) I am feeling SO SO GUILTY right now. I impulsively 'pitik' (without any second thoughts, as if my hand acted on its own due to my emotions) my mother slightly at the back of her head after I was offended by what she said. She said, 'nananakit ka na ah' and kinda punched me on my shoulder. Her words HURT me, knowing that my father physically abused her before. I just want to KMS I FEEL SO GUILTY

But she also hurts us when she gets angry. I hate how I am becoming like them. I'm literally trying hard to control myself when I'm feeling overwelming emotions because I usually hurt myself but this time I JUST CANT.... : (

I was Raped and Ngayon Lang Nag Sink In Sa Akin,"**TW: S\*xual Abuse, S\*x**

Five days since that happened. I thought I was ok and I thought that once I cried it all out, I would be relieved of the pain. But here I am, at the bodega of our office. Crying my heart out and wishing that if I could go back on that day, sana hindi na lang yun nangyari.

That Tito has been on my posts since we met. My list could go on on the things he made me feel that made me trust him. We met thrice since last month. We have been messaging almost everyday. We were FWBs. Giver that I am, what pleasure he made me feel - I want to reciprocate that. I was willing to explore his k\*nks. He made me feel respected. He was all for consent - except that fateful night.  
That was Friday of last week. We decided to meet. I will not go much into details - I have posted it on a different sub where I think the topic is most appropriate. I never thought that I would post this here since I thought that time will heal all wounds - but now, I don't even think that is possible.

We were together that night. We just finished with that first round and while waiting for our food na dumating (thru Grab and Food Panda). While waiting - it said 30 minutes before the food arrives and I was just watching Netflix on my phone. I was lying face down with a pillow while watching a series. He went on top of me (while I was still watching Netflix) and Tito started fondling my bo\*bs. He kept on kissing my neck and I tried telling him that the food delivery is due for 15 minutes or less. He told me that, ""Wala pa lage na (Wala pa yan)"". What he did took me by surprise. He stood up and dragged my cycling shorts. Ok a quickie. Just when I thought his dick would be entering my p\*ssy, he entered in the wrong hole. It was my an\*s. We had no lube. His whole weight was on me and he was holding my hips while I exclaimed in fear and pain, ""Tito ayaw tito. Sakit."" But he proceeded in entering me from behind and he forced his dick on my an\*s. I buried my face on the pillow I was holding and cried incessantly, ""Tito tama na, sakit na kaayo. Tama na tito please."" I don't know what's gotten into him. The caring Tito I knew was taken over by an animal blinded with lust. He kept pounding on me, uttering, ""Tita lamia nimo uy (Tita ang sarap mo). Guot kaayo ka (Ang sikip mo)"". I don't know how long it went. When he finished and came, he told me that he will remove his dick and when he did, it was painful. I was sore.

He went to the bathroom and I was left in bed. Curled and blankly staring at the walls. Phone rang and food has arrived and he went outside, oblivious of me. I went inside the shower room and tears can't stop falling. When I went outside he was arranging the food. He called me. I sat down and he just asked if I was ok and why am I quiet. I just told him, ""Ayaw rako i-mind Tito. Kaon lang ta."" While eating, he was the usual Tito. Jolly, full of stories. Maybe he came from a long day at the resto, maybe he was stressed. But I can't seem to find it in me to smile again and be jovial.

I felt empty. We finished eating and we slept. While he slept soundly, I was curled up. I felt cold inside. I kept on crying silently and it was as if yesterday when it was my estranged husband was with me. Yes I was physically, emotionally and sexually abused by my husband. Memories of him punching me in the stomach and hurting me and afterwards cajoling me to have s\*x - thinking it would ease the pain he caused me flooded me last night. I was back to being that girl five years ago - scared, anxious and broken.

I did not leave. We never had s\*x again. I told Tito that I am not feeling well. I did not cuddle with him. He left first. He had to prepare for work. I was left in the room, feeling nothing but emptiness.  
Five days have passed. I thought I was ok. I did not block him. He said his apologies. He told me that lust overtook him. That he also did not understand why he did that. And last night, when I got the strength to really reply and talk to him - his eventual nonchalance hit me. I am a very patient person. I held on to my husband for five years despite his physical and emotional abuse. Last straw for me was when after niya akong bugbugin, he still cajoled me and forced himself on me. That was an out of body experience. I was not there while he kept on pounding himself on me. I cried. I begged him to stop. But he did not. He came, turned his back on me and slept like a f\*cking baby.

Yung galit ko is like a fire na binuhusan mo ng gasolina - it fires up strong, matingkad but it quickly dies down. And I just realized that when it died down - I felt empty. Yung parang wala na. Wala na akong mabubuga. I am crying now. I am in pain. Same feeling after my husband used me. Same feeling after I found out that that one first FWB last year was married and has a kid. Same old feeling now that it just sunk in that the one I have trusted ignored my pleas and cries and continued using me.

I kept questioning myself, what did I do wrong to deserve these events? Anong bang kasalanan ko? May mali ba akong nagawa? May hindi ba ako nagawa that made them hurt me? Am I not worthy of their honesty, respect and love? Is my worth measured by the pleasure and use that they can get from me? Why is it that NO and YES - two and three letter word are the most difficult for others to comprehend?

I just hope that time will prove itself to me - that it will heal all these wounds. That someday, someone will love me not for what I can give but what and who I really am. :(

Your Tita :(

  
**EDIT AS OF 9:13 AM**

Thank you for your messages and comments. This post is not to ask for sympathy. This is for me an awareness post so that everybody may be aware that this incidents really happen. There are people who really don't understand the word NO. I have also read comments here which I find offensive - I just blocked them. I believe that anyone - everyone for that matter - be it in the hookup scene or not deserve respect. Hindi naman po ibig sabihin na we are in the hookup culture, anyone can just degrade us. We all wanted that feel good sex - with consent of course. Nothing against those whose kink border into sadism and the likes. We all have our preferences. 

He is not my Tito na relative per se. That's how we call ourselves being in the early thirties. 

Thank you for the comments. I hope all will be ok not just for me but also for those who are going through something. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1bj403s/i_was_raped_and_ngayon_lang_nag_sink_in_sa_akin/,t2_svzja58hc,2024-03-20 11:26:54,54,23
Indenial na plus size na pala talaga ako,"Im a 23yrs old woman and ive been chubby pretty much my whole life. I love food and yun lang din talaga major stress reliever ko + i have unhealthy relationship with food dahil sa toxic mom ko. 

I was 16 when i finally lost a lot of weight and pasok na ako sa size small. I belong sa first ever batch ng grade 11 and super nakaka stress for me yung shs life kasi nahirapan ako sa STEM strand. So i was slowly gaining weight pero parang continuous naman yung cycle ko na mag didiet tas medyo mag gagain weight, tas mag didiet and lose weight ulit. And super hirap ng gantong lifestyle kasi halos binibase ko yung confidence ko sa weight ko. 

And when i turned 18, first year college, i had my first boyfriend na turned out to be a manipulative cheater and super toxic and traumatic nung relationship namen for me. I gained a lot during our 7-month relationship. Kasi dahil sa emotional abuse niya, super nawalan ako ng self esteem and confidence. But after we broke up, i had to redeem myself and nag balik alindog ulit hahaha. Went to gym and kahit na i wasnt totally thin, i had better shape, i felt sexy and was very confident during this time. I was happy being finally free from that toxic relationship eh so it reflected sa way ng pag alaga ko sa sarile ko.

So i was okay with my body sa first half of my second year in college, kaso nagka pandemic naman. I know andaming ibang tao na mas naging malaki yung problem during the height of the pandemic. And i also had the worst struggle with my mental health during that time. As in there was even a time na nag hyperventilate ako for several hours due to anxiety. 

Sobrang lala ng mental health ko nun so i didnt care less about my physical body. I gained a looooot of weight. From around 55kgs during 2nd year college, naging around 80kgs ako after 3 years. And now i dont know if i will ever be able to lose that weight anymore. Im working na and i dont have the energy and will to exercise nowadays. I feel disgusted seeing my hugeee tummy in front of the mirror. I dont like taking photos na din, i would hate every photo na kitang kita double chin ko. 

And earlier, after a longggg time, i tried to workout again. I took a picture of my body to see my progress and i just realized na ang LAKI ko na pala talaga. From s to m size and now nasa xxl size na. And its funny na when i posted sa other subs with my description, i mentioned na medyo plus size ako hahahaa ""medyo"" amp. Indenial much ampota.

ive only been recently realizing how severely depressed i actually am and it scares me how good i am at hiding it from everyone including myself,"tw depression

everyone knows me as cheerful and goofy and silly. people straightup tell me they admire how light and positive i am, meanwhile i often feel so sad that im suffocating and i hold back tears while eating dinner because i feel like crying for no reason.  
  
i have a job as a wfh software engineer and it's overwhelming to me but upon reading stories online and from what my coworkers tell me it's normal to be overwhelmed, unfortunately i mercilessly emotionally abuse myself over it though i am trying to change that  
  
what's so difficult about being depressed is that i already know what i must do, i've learned a lot from podcasts held by therapists and so many things they teach make sense to me and click for me to the point i cry, but the thing is i have so little energy and focus it's hard to apply their teachings. and it makes me more frustrated knowing what to do, simple things really like thanking yourself for the things you do, meditating for 40 seconds or however long i can, but still struggling to do them. and then i start hating myself more for struggling to do them.  
  
my default mood is sad. i am practicing self awareness and mindfulness and the realizations crush me. i am just sad all the time. but smiling is so easy and it doesn't even register as faking it, i'm probably not faking it thou. what i feel is, when i laugh and smile with others i am actually happy, but the sadness underneath doesn't go away, it's like i'm happy and sad at the same time. and as soon as the happy moment is over it's an immediate snap back to pure sadness.  


i checked the rules so i think it's okay to post this, idk if anyone will read this but i will try to be consistent with posting because it's healthy",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/18ithk1/ive_only_been_recently_realizing_how_severely/,t2_fq69goo5,2023-12-15 14:11:30,4,5
ang saya makahinga ng maluwag,"possible TW

lumipat kami rito sa bahay ng tita ko kasi sobrang abusive ng tatay ko. nananakit siya physically and emotionally, sobrang libog din niya. naninilip siya kapag maliligo ako o kapag iihi ako tapos he would act like it was ""accudental"", napansin din pala ng kapatid ko 'yun kaya he helped me change curtains doon sa CR ng bahay ng tatay ko. nung una akala ko nasa isip ko lang 'yun and accidentally lang talaga. pero nagpipigil na ako ng ihi ko madalas nung nandun pa kami and I don't take showers regularly na rin dahil natatakot na ako na masilipan uli. kahit 'yung skin care ko hindi ko na rin magawa kasi natatakot ako na baka mag-attempt na naman siyang hipuan ako. 

ngayong nandito na ako sa bahay ng tita ko, I take showers regularly na and I started to do my skin care na uli. bumalik na rin appetite ko. hindi ko na kailangan mag-earphones uli para magpatugtog ng malakas kapag nag-aaway sila mama. hindi ko na kailangan pilitin sarili ko na matulog kapag lasing na naman tatay ko para lang hindi ako ma-trigger. wala na rin akong suicidal ideation since we moved out saka nakaka-feel na ako ng emotions ngayon kahit konti, hindi na rin ako numb physically. 

sobrang freeing na wala na kami sa bahay ng tatay ko.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/18mq7y9/ang_saya_makahinga_ng_maluwag/,t2_8hhjd65v,2023-12-20 16:58:43,7,0
I feel emotionally detached from my mum,I don't feel like I love my mum anymore or I feel detached from her. I don't feel any warmth towards her. I don't come for her for emotional support. I don't want to hug her or talk to her that much. And when I look at her I don't think of her as my mother but as someone who clamis to be. She is not abusive. Well at least not anymore. But I can say that she did a shitty job rasing me up. But right now I can't shake off the feeling that I don't love my mum anymore.,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/17omg2t/i_feel_emotionally_detached_from_my_mum/,t2_fsujrqngq,2023-11-06 05:38:44,2,0
Space,"It's my first time to share something here...Let me start with telling a bit about myself, I'm married and i have three kids also (I'm a full time mom)... It's kinda tiring din pala na umunawa all the time. I'm not saying wala akong fault sa relationship namin ni hubby pero the fact na nilalang niya lang yung pagiging housewife ko is not a good thing na yun at yun nagiging issue niya to be stuck up instead of leading our family ng maayos. Like pag wala syang work iisipin lang niya yon but will not do anything para may ibang pagkuhanan ng funds and magseself pity and barkada na lang. Which is nakakafrustrate talaga. What's more upsetting is people around us is helping so that we can survive everyday and yet nagaaburido pa sya and all and it came to a point na pag nagaaway kami hindi dumadating sa point na kalma lang it will always be na sisigawan ka niya na rinig na rinig ng mga kapitbahay at sasabihan ka ng foul words like pokpok and stuff na naririnig din ng mga anak namin. Until it came to a point na wala na kong maramdaman... Na i found peace when we don't talk to each other... It all started din when he said hindi na niya ko mahal. I will not lie na pag nagaaway kami i feel the same way pero i keep forgiving pa din until naubos na ko. Mapapagod ka dahil physically, mentally and emotionally abused ka by your spouse. Na ayaw mong sukuan sana pero ikaw na lang yung kumakapit sa relationship niyo. I think walang masama sa pagiging full time housewife kaya ayoko ilook down what set up i have now but with what I'm experiencing now I want to work and take this experience positively to grow as individual and for my kids. Iba iba tayo ng point of view and tolerance when it comes to our relationship. Mas okay na yung may acceptance kesa you keep coming back to the same scenario and not improving",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1bjrnbj/space/,t2_topq0aja8,2024-03-21 07:18:06,1,0
helping my partner,"we had a baby a few months ago. i have a very loving and understanding partner. he works two jobs and aside from that never siya nagbigay ng rason para hindi makatulong sakin at kay baby. he helps my siblings and my mom (absentee cheating father) financially, emotionally, halos lahat-lahat kahit sa chores sa bahay tumutulong siya. 

he lets me sleep a lot. he's very vocal and hindi niya ako hinahayaang mapagod. he's like the partner/father na sobrang blessed ako kasi he's not the typical nonchalant o abusive. he earns around 70k a month and kasya naman yun samin but i dont want him to get super tired.

i want to work pero di pa ako nakapag graduate and no experience pa. i help my aunt sa business niya i do her bookkeeping and journaling pero small help lang and pay since she's literally the reason kung bakit may kinakain pa mga kapatid ko. 

i don't know how or where to start and what are the things that i should learn. he doesn't want me to work kasi sobrang baby pa ng cutiepie namin but i cant let him do all the work nakokonsensya ako.

Went thru therapy but still have so much trauma,"I’m 27 and I’m a single mom for 3 years to a brilliant 6 year old boy. I tried naman mag-family with my baby daddy who’s been my bf 3 years prior pero hindi talaga nagwork. He has narcissistic tendencies and physically abused me. Of course it’s challenging kasi I come from a broken home, and now I’m passing it on to my child. Thankfully, I have the support of my family behind me so I now work my ass off for them, and to fix my life as well. When we separated I went thru therapy and naayos ko naman life ko for the past 2 years.

Along came R. A year ago I met him and he’s a 39 yo bachelor na recently annulled. He came along swiftly, met my family, pursued and declared na he loves me and even met my son. We planned for a family and future together. But somewhere along the 4-month mark, he deactivated and stopped giving me any affection. I panicked and I broke it off with him.

After 3 weeks of no contact, I reached out.

It’s been almost 8 months na and we still talk. Although he heavily avoids serious talks we still see each other when he’s in town, date, and remained friends. Although we are no longer sweet and affectionate.

I know I’m one na super smart and talented, beautiful, hardworking. Pero tanga sa pag-ibig. I’m a panganay so ang taas din ng masculine energy ko when it comes to my family. Although I know I’m not very stable din sa relationship kasi I never had a strong father figure. Kaya I feel doon ako natagilid in terms of being a good woman. May effect talaga not having a father. Up to now my father is still emotionally abusive kasi he uses drugs.

When it comes to R, I don’t know, I was the first one to tell him na he has dyslexia which he only realized now despite his age. He has strong dismissive avoidant tendencies which iniintindi ko nalang. If anyone knows what a DA is, they’re hard to be in a relationship with. We both had so much trauma growing up. I accept and understand things because I know I myself am not an easy person to be with.

Of course in the course of 8 months despite being friends I have feelings of loneliness. I know to love is to suffer, since that’s the only type of love I know and I accept this fate. I suffer from anxiety and depression. 

Despite my strong resolve to fix my life I fell for a person like me. Who also have huge trauma and baggages. It is what it is eh I don’t know if he is good for me or bad. I feel no one in the world would ever understand me.

I really wish my life will somewhat be in better order in the coming years. But I think as a person who’s been through so much I’ll always be in a flight or fight mode. So I think I need so much therapy pa.

If you read to this point thank you lol! I believe I am a good person but I am in a huge battle with my past. I hope I win… For my son’s sake. 🫰

Abused,"Help your girlie out there, need ko lumipat urgently. It's been years na din and I'm very vocal sa physical abuse na ginagawa ng tatay ko ever since. And tonight was the worse, I don't know bat ako pinag-iinitan lately and I won't regret any impulsive  decision that I will made today. 

Just a minutes ago, binugbog ako ng tatay ko and was I was also hit below my head. Ramdam ko ang sakit sa katawan until now and I feel na magkakapasa to, I will take pics and magpapa medical agad ako tomorrow just in case na mag-file ako ng kaso. Do you know where can I get medical for this? Sa Parañaque po near sucat. 

Also I need to move out urgently, and he's making me stress throughout my childhood and until now and inaabuso physically and emotionally. Di ko maigalaw ng maayos ang likod ko ngayon. 

I need peace. And I will move out. 

Do you also know a place where can I rent for 2000? Alabang sana near festival. Di ko alam kung kakayanin ko pa tumagal dito. And I also let my friends know about this matter just in case something happened to me tonight. 

Di ako magaling mag kwento, pero sana maintindihan niyo. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1b3r2qu/abused/,t2_jbmennajw,2024-03-01 18:25:33,12,8
Attachment issues,"Little background first, I am a survivor of SA. Strongly believed that I have been emotionally abused by immediate family members. It took me almost 9 years to recover and mature properly since I had to step up in my family as the adult. Not to mention, just got out of a emotionally and toxic relationship just last year. My partner was a complete nightmare. Not only he invalidates my SA experience but started to control on how I dress, friends and family members (he was telling me that he was jealous of my immediate family members because of our closeness?)Based on my past experiences and family background, I would say it’s understandable that I start to develop unhealthy habits such as Attachment Issues.

There’s this guy I’ve been following, I think he’s brave for surviving every thing that happened to him. Not to mention his views based on politics. I’ve always wanted to talk to him but I have trouble coming neat male figures and we both had indirect past issues due to his friends. Right now, when I checked his twt I was surprised to see he was dating. Good for him! I’m genuinely happy and relief, he found someone to be his haven; his safe space. Nothing brings me more joy than to see people finding partners in this world. Especially, it can be a rough ride. But I can’t help but feel a little bit sad. Maybe I had a little crush? I don’t know. I don’t have a strong definition and image of love because of my parents.

Sorry for rambling. I needed a space just to spill my thoughts.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/13j1lrr/attachment_issues/,t2_behgfeeju,2023-05-16 18:42:48,1,0
