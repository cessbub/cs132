Emotionally Abused,"ngayon ko lang nalaman na form ng emotional abused inabot ko sa mga taong tinuring kong pamilya. i always say na magkaroon nang maayos na communication but palagi silang passive-agressive every time they have a problem with me. cold and silent treatment din natatanggap ko kapag may problema sila na wala naman akong kinalaman. naging punching bag ako and source nila ng aruga. they drained the fuck out of me. at nang sumabog ako, they made me feel like ako ang mali. i'm just glad internship na at di ko na sila makakasama. nakakasuka. nakakasawa magtiwala.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/19912q9/emotionally_abused/,t2_f4ixiymq,2024-01-18 00:45:10,2
Good bye mr. Emotionally abusive guy,"Ended my situationship with an older guy a while ago because i couldnt take the disrespect anymore. 

Pag talaga nagagalit ang ibang tao, dun mo sila mas nakikilala. The way they let out their frustrations, the reasons why theyre frustrated, and how they treat people ariund them when theyre frustrated, these things matter and will show eventually. 

I told him ive been surrounded by family members who seem to have anger issues but it turns out ganun din pala siya. It scared me when he became mad out of nowhere and how invalidated my emotions. It was obvious how he tried to manipulate and confuse me into thinking na may nagawa nga akong mali. He also refused to communicate.  He would just say na forget about what happened without even saying sorry of fully talking about what just transpired.

He even tried to threaten me na ibblock ako nung inopen ko ulit yung problem na yun. That moment was my turning point already. Ive realized that time how he’s trying to impose his control over me and our situation. How fucked up he is. I lost all my genuine feelings for him at napalitan ng pure hatred.

Kanina lang, i decided to leave and block him. Good riddance.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/18rcpiv/good_bye_mr_emotionally_abusive_guy/,t2_hf0d4ej40,2023-12-27 01:05:46,11
so tired of the emotional abuse at home,"My mom and I haven’t talked since Tuesday. She has been giving the silent treatment because I put my hands to face like [this](https://www.dreamstime.com/stock-image-man-put-his-hands-face-image24096821) and she thinks it’s because of her. 

Pero nung araw na yun, I had a big presentation for my supervisor, I had b2b client meetings, my psychiatrist cancelled the day before, and I had an upcoming talk which I hadn’t prepared for. 

She asked me “ano ba problema mo?” in an angry tone and I told her it was because of stress. She reacted angrily kasi akala niya it was because of her. How am I supposed to open up if she doesn’t listen and galit agad kapag magreact? Now she hasn’t talked to me in 5 days.

I honestly am not affected by the silence and ignorance. It’s more of the emotional abuse from a narcissistic parent na matagal ko nang tinitiis since I entered school. It’s tiring and I want to move out. I live with a nmom and an enabler, cheating dad. You can check my profile, I have a lot of stories there. Ang hirap nilang pakisamahan :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/12urkfj/so_tired_of_the_emotional_abuse_at_home/,t2_c6uh1mzu,2023-04-22 10:25:27,1
Namatay na yung tita ko who physically & emotionally abused me & my sister nung highschool kami pero wala akong naramdaman nung nawala sya.,"Napatawad ko na sya. Nakahingi pa nga sya ng tawad 2 months bago sya namatay. Sabi ko, wala na yun tita. Kalimutan mo na yun.  Totoong napatawad ko na sya pero traumatized pa rin ako pag may mga bagay na nakakapang trigger sa akin ng mga bad memories na iyon.

Unexpected ang death nya. Nasa Canada na ko ngayon. Nung nabalitaan ko yon, iyak ng iyak mama ko. Pero ako, wala. Blanko lang. Of course hindi ako masaya sa nangyari pero hindi rin naman ako nalungkot at naapektuhan.

I feel bad for feeling this way.

7 years din kaming nasa puder nya. May mga good memories naman pero bilang lang. Pag lang naka mood sya pag may pera sya that time. Pag wala, ayun, Princess Sarah at Ms. Minchin na ang atake.

Hindi ko masabi to sa mama ko kasi alam kong masasaktan sya. Kapatid nya yun at mahal nya. Kahit may nagawang ganun ang tita ko, sobrang buti ng mama ko at pinatawad nya.

Sabi ng mama kahit ano raw nagawang masama sa amin, wag na wag daw kaming hihiling ng ikakasama ng iba.

Gusto ko lang din sabihin na proud ako na sya ang mama ko. <3",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/19987qx/namatay_na_yung_tita_ko_who_physically/,t2_knsfqyyap,2024-01-18 05:24:41,283
Na survive ko ang physical at emotional abuse today,"3 sampal at katakot takot na threats dahil sa walang humpay na pag iyak ko, sampalin ka ba naman eh. 

Para akong mababaliw kanina, hinihila, sinisiko, pinipilit mag salita, tinutulak. Para akong pinalong aso sa pag iyak  na naka suksok sa sulok tas pag hinahawakan lalong lumalakas ang iyak dahil nakakatakot na bawat hawak sayo may hagupit na kapalit. 

Hindi ko akalain na magagawa sakin ng SO (now ex) ko to. First time kong masaktan sa relationship at trauma is real. Dahil lang sa di ko masunod ang gusto nya kahit at risk ang health ko. 

Tinapos ko na at sana huling encounter na namin sa isa't Isa. Naiiyak ako pag naiisip ko yung ginawa nya. Mahal nya daw ako pero bakit ganun? Pag mamahal pa ba yun kung ganoon? Relieved lang ako dahil naka survive ako.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/11onrq9/na_survive_ko_ang_physical_at_emotional_abuse/,t2_vr5ufi9p,2023-03-12 00:04:29,8
Finally got out of a toxic and emotionally abusive relationship!,"I did it! I ended it, kahit mahirap.

So many chances, so much forgiveness, understanding, at love ang binigay ko, kaso this time narealize ko ang self-worth ko. I realized that this time ay respetuhin ko naman ang sarili ko. I had already set boundaries with him but he continually breaks them. Hindi naman siya ganito dati, but I don't know what happened kung bakit siya nagbago.

I wanted for us to communicate and resolve our misunderstandings in a calm and loving manner. Ilang beses na siya nagpromise na aayusin niya yun. Naniwala ako sa kanya dahil pagkaresolve kasi namin ng issue, sobrang sweet at lambing. Pero kapag in times na may problema, sobra sobra magalit.

Di ako makaalis dahil nagccling pa ako sa hope na baka bumalik naman yung maayos na trato niya sakin from years ago. Pero wala talaga. Pinipiling makipagbreak instead na makipagcommunicate. Lagi nalang ako napagbubuntungan ng anger issues to the point na sinisigawan, pinagmumura, at ginagaslight ako.

I know I wasn't perfect sa relationship namin at may mga pagkukulang din ako. Pero, hindi yun free pass para pagmumurahin na ako. Yun na yung naging last straw para sa'kin.

It was clear that the man I used to love wasn't there anymore. I hope he's okay and safe though, and that he gets the help that he needs. But for now, we're not meant for each other and maybe it's better that way.

If you're stuck in a toxic relationship now, just know that there's still hope out of this seemingly endless tunnel and I hope that the time will come when you could muster up the courage to get out of it.

My employer let people get away with emotionally abusing me at work because they conveniently blamed my mental struggles,"Full disclosure I truly did suffer depression because of previous incident at work.

I worked with someone who I worked with for years and I trusted. A new person then got added to the team. At first things were fine but they started to exclude me and refused to work with me whenever we worked together in the same shift.

I tried to fix the dynamic by asking what I did wrong but I was told there wasn't anything wrong and they weren't excluding me even though it was pretty clear they were. They even gaslit my wife telling her she didn't understand because she's not working at the same company even though I tell her everything.

I ended my friendship with the person I worked for years and my bosses today, while supportive and gave me very favored plans moving forward it is a shame that they believed the culprits in them saying it's ""all in my head"" and my reaction was due to my mental struggles.

Remember kids, do not let anyone you do not trust know that you are dealing with mental struggles. They will use it against you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1671mhi/my_employer_let_people_get_away_with_emotionally/,t2_daxg1,2023-09-01 16:46:18,2
"I just realized that my emotionally abusive, 5 year ex-girlfriend may have cheated on me and her family supported it?","I feel like complete shit and in a span of 20 minutes yung self-image and self-worth ko has become so distorted and I don't really know what to do with myself. Honor roll ako na IT student, and Vice president in training para sa Esports organization ng University namin. I try to really put a lot of time and effort into my studies, because I want a better life for myself and for my parents and I want to make them proud. The usual stuff.  

Naiintindihan ko na baka na kulangan na ako ng oras sayo, kasi sobrang busy ko na, pero parang grabe naman yung cheating na supported ng pamilya mo. I feel so fucking sad and confused, kasi I have always tried my best to make you feel loved in various ways, because you've always been someone who has needed constant reassurance. I built and performed occasional upgrades and maintenance on your pc, kumakain tayo sa labas, nag tiles, pintura, semento pa ako and various other stuff sa bahay niyo, we would video call every night too, I would try my best to get along with your family even though I'm not a social person. I can't even enumerate enough how much I've sacrificed for you. 

Siguro kasalanan ko din. Sobrang lenient ko din kasi sayo ee. Alam kong nahihirapan kang makahanap ng mga kaibigan kaya nung may mga naging kasundo ka naging sobrang maluwag ko. May nanglandi daw sakanya, and because  I had so much trust in her I just took her word for it when she said that she just brushed it off. Tinuturuan daw pala kasi siya mag billiards hahaha tapos inoofferan ihatid, pumupunta pa siya sa concert nung guy pero ok lang sakin kasi kasama niya daw friends niya and I thought it was a good opportunity to build friendships, in between those ang dami pa nilang inuman kasama siya and instances ng gala nila na hindi din siguro ako aware. Kaya pala ang dalas mo manood ng basketball intrams hahaha tapos makikita ko nung hiwalay na tayo may picture ka pa kasama siya.

Birthday ng mommy niya the other day and they posted a picture of the guy having dinner with the whole family. I broke up with her, because she became so emotionally unbearable and controlling. Its barely been a month and I don't think you would introduce a guy that fast after your 5 year relationship just ended?, unless they've known about it beforehand and even then how would they even be remotely fine with something like that. I honestly would have been fine, if we just grew apart or for some other reason that's normal, pero grabe yung ganito. It feels different when you think that the whole relationship went to shit in the first place, because she was already eyeing somebody else. 

It breaks my fucking heart, because I was insecure about the guy in the first place, pero I put in blind fucking trust, because I believe a relationship's foundation should be built on that. I can't even afford to be fucking sad right now kasi mag eexam na kami, I have deadlines, and may upcoming big event yung organization. I can't breathe properly and I feel like I'm gonna fall apart   
Ang bigat ng puso ko. I've been meditating, smoking, studying, and coding for hours to try and cope, but I don't think its enough. Any inspirational quote, insight, or ways to cope would be greatly appreciated po.

0.3 lang yan. Never mong malalabas yan! My (M30) longterm GF (F30) ay may requirement na 1.0c Engagement Ring bago sya mag-Yes!,"0.3 nga lang yan. Never mo ng ilalabas yan!  
This is her exact words. Nagkaroon kami ng argument kagabi ng gf ko last night at umabot sa sumbatat bakit hindi padin ako nag ppropose sakanya kahit lahat ng kaibigan at kakilala nya ay either kasal or engaged na.   
Last Feb, bumili ako ng 0.3c Engagement Ring with GIA Cert. sa isang kilalang shop sa Quiapo na umabot ng PHP40k. Balak ko sana mag-propose sa araw ng birthday ko pero somehow ay sinabihan nya ako pabiro before ng birthday ko ay wag ako mag ppropose kase nasa bahay lang kami at walang design akong dala for proposal. After ng birthday ko, dito na nag simula na mag sabi na gusto nya na 1.0c na engagement ring, palagi nya sakin to sinasabi in random ocassions at sinasabi nya din na wag ako mag propose kung 0.3 lang balak kong ibigay sakanya. Dahil din dito bakit nadelay at parang nawalan ako ng gana na mag-propose sa ngayon.  
Last July, kinasal yung kaibigan nya sa Zambales at kailangan mag-stay sa isang resort. Dito ko sya kinausap tungkol sa mga hirit nya regarding proposal and ring size. Inexplain ko din na para sakin ang meaning ng proposal ay ung commitment namin sa isa't isa regardless sa ring size. Feeling ko kase gusto nya lang ipakita sa ibang tao ung ring size na natanggap nya kesa  yung actual commitment namin sa isa't isa.  
Early this morning, sinabi nya sakin na wag na ako mag-ppropose kung 0.3c lang kaya kong ibigay sakanya. Nasaktan ako. Kase, indirectly na sya na-""NO"" sa proposal ko knowing na nakabili na ako. Hindi ko na alam gagawin. Wala na din akong gana mag-propose pa sakanya. Hindi lang din sa kadahilan na to. Dahil din sa way ng pag-trato nya sakin. Nanghihinayang lang ako makipag hiwalay ulit kase binalikan ko sya last 2020. Ginawa ko naman lahat. Pero bumalik ulit kami sa toxic relationship.  Balik ulit sa verbal and emotional abuse.   
Di ko na alam. Gusto ko nalang ulit makipaghiwalay.

Lahat nlng “gaslighting.” Pwede namang “persuade” o “convince”,"Rinding-rindi na ako. 

A lot of times I see people saying they gaslit themselves into /xyz/ when really, they just convinced themselves into doing it. 

Please, lahat nlng talaga.

Gaslighting is abuse. It should not be taken lightly and thrown around so loosely. 

Ano yung totoong pag-gaslight sa sarili? 

Gaslighting yourself that it wasn’t rape kasi magjowa kayo. 

Gaslighting yourself into thinking na deserve mo yung abuse na nakukuha sa parents mo kasi sila naman nagpalaki sayo. 

Gaslighting yourself is excusing someone’s bad behavior kasi “they’ve always been like that” or “it’s okay, we’re close naman.”

Gaslight din yung pag-iisip na may mali sayo when in fact you just need rest kasi you’re juggling too many things at once but you keep denying that.

Hngggh!!!

I know some of them are satire pero it’s making my brain itch!

You didn’t gaslight yourself into cleaning your room. 

Please. That’s a win! That’s not abuse. 

And also, while we’re at it, sharing your stories of trauma with each other is not trauma bonding. A trauma bond is the emotional attachment you get/develop for your abuser. 

Did you know na may mga nai-inlove sa kidnappers nila dahil binibigyan sila ng meal once a day?  That’s trauma bond.

Living with my abuser.,"#Trigger warning 
#I need help. 

#I married a monster.

Long post ahead. Please bare with me.  

I consider myself as a single mom of many kids. 

Isipin niyo na lahat ng word na pwede niyo ikabit sa word na abused. Ako yun. 

Sinasaktan niya ako if I refuse to have sex with him. Ang sabi niya “responsibilidad” ko daw yun bilang asawa. NO THAT’S MARITAL RAPE kako. Meron pang isang bagay na gustong gusto niya ginagawa pero di ko na masasabi kasi it will be a give away. (Sexual and physical abuse). 
He cheated on me and I had STD not once, not twice… I told him that it’s actually ground for annulment. Feeling ko ang dumi dumi ko. 

Ilan taon na ako lang ang bumuhay sa pamilya namin. (Economic abuse) 

Gina-gaslight niya ako and he used emotional manipulation. He one time said he’d kill himself dahil ayaw kong makipag sex sa kanya.  (Emotional abuse). 

To name a few. 

Ilang beses na akong nag attempt na makipag hiwalay sa kanya, but he knows I have a forgiving heart. Pero lahat my limit. Nauubos din tayo. 

We moved to a different city to start a new life. Ang alam ng mga friends ko hiwalay na kami. Which is partly true. Di ko lang sinabi na nagkabalikan kami kasi I used it as an excuse (not my proudest moment) I don’t like telling lies. Siguro napapansin nila na di ko sinasagot yung mga tanong nila. Para di na ako mag lie pa. 

It was so bad na umabot ako sa point that I almost kill myself. 2 tao lang nakakaalam nito. 

Few years ago he throw a fit kasi ayaw kong makipag sex sa kanya. I was so tired galing sa work tapos ako pa naglinis ng house. He was jobless. Pag di nagwo-work yung pagwawala niya he resorts to verbal abuse towards my kids. Hindi ko kinaya. I begged him to kill me para matapos na lahat ng paghihirap ko. Few months after that nagtino. So kala ko ok na. Nope. Nagkawork lang siya pero ganun pa din. Masaya kaming lahat sa bahay pag wala siya. Tahimik ang mundo. 

Couple of years ago I decided na ayaw ko na talaga. I told him to move out. But he didn’t. But for me hiwalay na kami. Pinaalis ko siya sa room. No physical contact di ko kinakausap nakablock sa lahat. I decided to take care of myself again. Nag message siya bigla using a different number, asking for sex. Like WTF! Seryoso? He began stalking my accounts. Called me a slut at may lalake daw ako. 

Last year he beat the shit out of me. Nag pa blotter ako, VAWC, pati sa Barangay. Walang nangyari. Sabi aalis na siya ng bahay pero nandito pa din. He threatens to kill me harm my family and friends at work. 

Madami siya kilala na influential na tao.

"My co-parent is a huge fucking piece of shit, and it took me three years to fully realize it.","Before I got into a relationship with my co-parent, I dated two other men who cheated on me and physically abused me. Though he didn't cheat on me, we still didn't work out because of his retroactive jealousy issues (my body count was a little higher than his), which then made him verbally abusive towards me. The emotional abuse got so bad that I resorted to self-harm, and all of this happened to me while I was in my first trimester of pregnancy. He also treated me like shit for getting pregnant and encouraged me to abort my son many times because it's bad for his career (as if he had any lol), and went as far as accusing me of making pikot because he comes from a political dynasty. After our failed engagement, I stayed away from dating because his words really cut deep, and I have completely lost my confidence in putting myself out there. During this time, I kept on blaming myself for all the shit he put me through, thinking that I deserved it because I chose to keep our son. I even told all my friends that he was the best partner I've ever had because unlike the others, he didn't cheat or physically harm me.

Thinking about it now, it was so fucking disgusting of me to rationalize what he did. I was a 22 year old girl then who was lost and suddenly plunged into parenthood, and instead of being kinder, he put me through so much. He shouted at me a lot in my own house, then called off our engagement on the sole reason that his brods think I'm a gold digger (idk where this came from bc he was basically unemployed for three months and I shouldered all his expenses then).

I got extra triggered today because he visited my home to meet my son, and he had the audacity to tell me I was not a good person. What a fucking piece of shit, I solely took care of my son for the past three years we were separated whilst he was busy chasing empty career promises of his brods. While he's sleeping sound, I was up taking care of my son then heading to work without sleep for 3 fucking years. Tapos ako pa yung hindi good person? Hahaha putang ina mo, T***. I hope you get what's coming to you, gago ka. Matapos ko lang 'tong masters ko, gago tatanggalin na talaga kita sa buhay namin ng anak ko.

I think what further solidified my long overdue anger is that I currently have a suitor now who is exerting so much effort for me, and is treating me so well. Despite his demanding schdule at work and in grad school, he visits me in a heartbeat when I need emotional support. Whatever free time he has, whether it be an hour or a day, he does his best to allot most of it for me. He treated me to nice dinners for no reason aside missing me. He really showed me that all my life, I settled for the bare minimum. Salamat na lang at hindi na ulit mangyayari 'yon, because I finally know what it's like to be loved. Whether we work out or not, I'm glad to have finally known my worth.

So TL;DR version: Tangina ng ex kong verbally abusive pati brods nyang makakapal ang mukha, and also that abuse isn't always cheating or physically beating. Often, it comes in the form of verbal and emotional abuse. Eitherway, we shouldn't settle for any when there are billions of people who are willing to give us so much more love.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1azyi8l/my_coparent_is_a_huge_fucking_piece_of_shit_and/,t2_ulxerfe3z,2024-02-26 04:49:00,6

my lola's friend caused someone's death.,"pa rant kasi parang ang hirap i-sink in yung mga nangyari. Mahaba 'to kaya please bear with me (pati na rin grammar ko, kasi indi ako magaling mag tagalog because I'm from Visayas)

So my Lola, (a teacher, retiring next year, and kapatid ng mismong Lola ko) has a friend which is a principal teacher sa isang public school dito samin. I met her many times before — sa mga parties and dinner with subject teachers. Okay naman siya. She's nice and has good communication skills. I prefer her over sa 'bestfriend' ng lola ko na mala karen ang attitude.

Not until I heard sa radyo (2 days ago) na there's a maid. A 19 years old, who committed suicide. And I was shocked nung narinig ko name ng amo niya. It was my lola's friend.. the principal teacher. I thought nagkamali lang ako ng rinig.. but it was really her.

The girl committed suicide because she wanted to attend college but eto naman si misis principal.. she said awful things to her simply because she doesn't want the girl na mag-aral and umalis. She even threatened the girl na sisirain niya yung card niya in front of her and she will call the police to accuse her of things na nawawala sa bahay if talagang aalis siya.

And you know what's worse?

She cursed the victim, saying awful words directly at her na she will always be a maid and graduating college doesn't suit her, dahil belong daw siya sa bundok where her parents work as magsasaka.

I was stunned to hear this and akala ko baka gawa gawa lang ng mga witness but there's a video of it. A fucking video of them talking. I don't know kung nasan yung video but I heard sa radyo na they watched it— and they were so mad at the principal teacher for causing someone's death. Not because of physical abuse, but mentally, and emotional abuse.

At eto pa ha, her salary every month is 3k lang?? and yung cheap rice pa yung pinapakain sakanya. Minsan saging lang. Tapos sometimes she's asked to iron the clothes daw ng amo niya every 12AM-1AM like what the fuck? The principal teacher is fucking rich. Her husband and daughter are fucking lawyers yet ganyan yung trato sakanya?! how inhumane!!

The girl opened up to her boyfriend and messaged him na she will end things as she don't see any future na daw because of what misis principal told her. Her boyfriend rushed doon sa bahay where she's working. Her boyfriend found her hanging but she was still alive..

However, she didn't make it. When she was at the hospital, she was choking na daw which caused her death..


I don't know what and how to react.. but damn this is just so..

Hay, rest in peace.. shit the victim didn't deserve that : (((

Nakakalungkot talaga and I feel so sad sa nangyari. Sobrang naiinis ako kasi I used to admire this principal yet to know na eto yung nangyari? Gosh, she did not only kill the girl.. but the victim's dreams na maging isang ganap na teacher din and for her family.

Potangina talaga. I hope the family will get the justice they deserve : ((


EDIT: I apologized for using the word 'owner' instead of 'amo' pasensya na po talaga and thank you so much for the correction...

"""m*m*tay pa ba ako kapag uminom ako ng 10 sodium ascorbate"" my friend asked me","Natrigger ako nung tinanong niya yan saakin. Gusto ko lang ito ilabas kasi hindi ko kayang makuwento sa iba. 

For context, nagka breakdown siya sa call because of a personal problem. I told her I will support her the best I can and when I am able. Those were my specific words. Sabi ko pa sa kaniya na ilabas niya lang pag-iyak niya at kung anong comfortable i-share para sa kaniya. Pero grabe na talaga, nagstart na ako ma anxious nung tinanong niya yan saakin. 

Few months ago, I had just set myself free from an emotionally abusive relationship, at halos ganiyan palagi mga sinasabi ng ex ko kapag nagb breakdown siya. I get na things can get really tough pero SOBRANG bigat sa konsensiya ko yan. I know that my friend knows na natataranta ako kapag nagiging su*cidal na ang ex ko noon, but maybe she forgot lang and that's quite expected na rin since months na naglipas. 

So, I did my best and stood my ground, and told her, 

""I am not fit to engage in conversations right now na kasi natrigger ako. i am sorry kung natrigger ako pero i know i have to withdraw muna kasi i have to take care of my (mental) health rin, but that does not make it your fault.""

Nagreply siya ""no need to come back"" daw. Duon ako nainis. Ano na gagawin ko p0t@ngina",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/17y7ohy/mmtay_pa_ba_ako_kapag_uminom_ako_ng_10_sodium/,t2_cn1xp5rnx,2023-11-18 22:31:51,154
Hindi ko nakikita sarili ko na mabubuhay lagpas 40.,"I just want to get this off my chest. I've been depressed since 2017 and started medication nung 2021, but I eventually stopped since hindi na  gumagana yung gamot. Isa rin sa reason is akala ko okay na ako kahit hindi naman pala haha false hope lang pala. I grew up in a family where I experienced emotional and physical abuse. As the eldest daughter, I have been through a lot. An emotional punching bag ng parents or sometimes punching bag. Gumanda lang relationship ko sa parents ko nung nag-study abroad na ako, which is sagot naman ng parents. anyways, I used to self harm to the point na nakita na ng parents ko dahil ayaw nila ako ipagamot.

Isa sa issue ko is hindi ko nakikita sarili ko na magpakasal or have a long term relationship. I am a very driven person at ang pinaka main goal ko ata sa life ay yumaman and travel kung saan-saan. Freedom ba. Actually naisip ko na if I ever date someone again in the future parang reason lang 'to para magstay ng matagal sa mundo. Pero hindi ko talaga nakikita sarili ko na tatanda with someone or tatanda in general. Gusto ko lang umabot ng 40 or 45 and then I can pass away. I want to die in a place where I will find peace, hindi na ata mababago isip ko. kung mabago man edi mabuti pero now this is something im sure na ill do. I have been through a lot and ayoko na patagalin buhay ko, ipupush ko na mangyari mga goals ko or maabot ito. Once na nagawa ko lahat ng gusto ko then I can finally cross the bridge.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/17i6erc/hindi_ko_nakikita_sarili_ko_na_mabubuhay_lagpas_40/,t2_45p30sa7,2023-10-28 12:57:43,145

It has been 13 years,"It has been 13 years since I told my parents that I was seeing then my boyfriend, now husband. It started like a normal day and then after breakfast I told my mother and stepfather I was seeing someone. I didn't expect just how extreme their reaction would be. I know they wouldn't be too happy because they were very strict. But I was 18, a legal adult who was leaving home for university in few short months so I thought that was enough for them to give some freedom. My mother went berserk. She yelled at me, cussed me out and called me a whore. She hurt me physically over and over. She threatened my life. My stepfather tried to play the nice guy by supposedly calming my mother. But I heard him egg her on. He asked to speak to my boyfriend to end our relationship. I was terribly frightened and helpless. Just after 9pm on that terrible day, I had to leave home and stay with a friend because my mother threatened more violence.

That was the start of their campaign of terror which lasted until the end of August when they eventually kicked me out of the house. I've always been abused in that house but they really ramped up the physical, mental and emotional abuse during those few weeks. I didn't even feel like human anymore towards the end. They've worn me down and I thought I was the worse person in the world. A dirty, good for nothing, whore of a daughter. 

Every year I feel the pain. As the months then the days approach to what I coined the anniversary, I am stuck in a cycle of reliving the pain. Some years I don't remember but when I close my eyes in the night I'm back in that moment. 

It has been 13 long years. I'm 31 now. I live in a nice house with the same man and have a good life. But every year, I feel like a helpless 18 year old again. My parents said I would understand their actions when I'm older. I'm still waiting for that day. The older I get, I feel more confused about their actions and their desire to hurt me. 

I feel angry because people in my world have moved on and expect me to do the same. I wish I can. I wish it doesn't hurt and that I no longer remember.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/158ams0/it_has_been_13_years/,t2_8epaki6q,2023-07-24 21:25:12,284
"Thank you, self for never giving up","2023 is your most difficult year so far - having discovered in May that your narcissistic ex had been cheating for 2 years out of the 2.5 years you were married.

You endured emotional abuse.

You miscarried what would have been your first baby together.

You lost millions and your first car to your ex.

You realized your in laws never loved nor cared about you.

You wanted to destroy him first. Then her. Especially her, who had the audacity to laugh in your face and call you a bitch for fighting for your marriage.

And yet, here you are, barely 1.5 hours before the year ends...

Still here, still hopeful, still standing.

Still grateful for the love that you still hold in your heart, for all the people who were - are - there for you in your darkest days.

It is an uphill battle, still. But today, self, let me honor you and tell you that I'm SO proud of you and the woman that you are.

And for 2024, I promise to love, care, and cherish you with all that I am, because you are *beautiful*. You are *worthy*. You are *loved*. 

You are meant to shine your light into the world, and no matter how dark it gets, you will make it because you love. You *are* love.

Finally after 2 failed relationships,"I met my current girlfriend last year about 2 months after my last failed relationship which was marred by intense emotional abuse and gaslighting. We didn’t exactly hit it off right away as lovers but eventually, I came to realize just how loving, caring, understanding, and supportive she was. While studying for law school entrance exams, she always gave me that extra lift I needed to keep going even though I was close to collapsing with exhaustion. I disclosed to her my GAD diagnosis and she was not only supportive about my mental health, she checks up on me every day and conducts mini debriefings of everyday events to help make sure I’m ready to face new days ahead. We are in a healthy, loving, mutually giving, and uplifting relationship. Yesterday, after we had a FaceTime call that lasted hours, as I went to sleep, I cried as I reflected on how just the right person, the right timing, and the right circumstances could lead me to her, the one. After being emotionally abused and taken advantage of in my previous relationships, I’m more than comfortable enough to say I don’t think I’ll ever have another one.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/14hq8rp/finally_after_2_failed_relationships/,t2_8t81nsbf,2023-06-24 19:08:08,9

Bata palang ako alam ko na na may mali sakin. Madaming nangyari sa buhay ko na naging dahilan para maging ganito ako. From Emotional to Physical abuse, to Financial and s*xual abuse. 

It started with anger management issues, mood swings,disruption in sleep up to extreme forgetfulness. Yung sobrang makakalimutin ko and yung pagiging inattentive ko, yung pinaka malaking reason kung bakit nahihirapan ako ngayon. I can't even remember what I did today and even yesterday. 

Depression comes in and go sakin. Di ko alam kung kailan ako last na mawalan ng suicidal thoughts or kung kailan ako nagkaroon ng genuine interest sa mga bagay sa paligid ko. Di ko na maalala.

I'm mentally unwell & it's hurting my loved ones,"Ang hirap maging mentally unwell. And I see how it's hurting my family & friends everytime they see me break. They're fixing things within me that they didn't even destroy to begin with.

I've been diagnosed in 2019 with depression & anxiety. But I know I've been experiencing it years prior pa. I know there are improvements sa depression ko. It's been a year since my last attempt but I do get anxiety & panic attacks. I was getting better.

Now, my mentally abusive, emotionally abusive, & financially abusive left me with PTSD. I got a half-assed apology & a thank you for saving him financially. Aminado siya na ginamit niya daw ako & he exploited my care for him sa dulo ng relasyon namin kasi alam niyang sasaluhin ko siya through & through. How he hurt me physically (unintentional daw), mentally, emotionally, & financially is unbelievable. Ubos na ubos ako nung iniwan niya. Ubos yung savings ko, sirang sira ako. While he's out there fucking his kabit (and now newly promoted to girlfriend).

Every single day, I get flashbacks. I fall into spiral of overthinking & consistent anxiety attacks. I get triggered & breakdown at the slightest reminder of them. I sometimes wake up in the middle of the night high on my fight or flight response —akala ko I'm back in our old apartment na inaalog at sinisigaw-sigawan niya ako or I'm waiting for him to get home from his motel nights with his kabit. It's manifesting in my health too. I couldn't sleep. I get severe headaches. I passed out a few times. I don't function well anymore.

My friends & family are out here trying to assist me & help me out. They're fixing me. They're doing their best to help me, especially my parents. And I know they're starting to get tired.

I'm doing everything I can to speed up my recovery. I spent a lot on check-ups, counselling, self-help books, medications & vitamins. I exert effort na bigyan sarili ko ng distractions. I'm trying hard.

Napaka hayop ng ex ko. Everyone around me is hurting because he abused me. He made my mental health worse. Akala niya ba ganun ganun lang yun? Emotional manipulation is not a joke. Also, katamtaman lang sahod ko. Everything I gave him, sagad na sagad talaga. Dugo't pawis puhunan. Tapos ayaw pa magbayad ngayon. Galing niya, nagbigay ng C-PTSD para di ko siya masingil ng ayos. He's even spreading na I have anxiety & that I'm lucky he stayed kahit na I was ill. Pa-hero effect pa. My anxiety worsened because he kept asking me for money & not allowing me to even take a rest.

I will either end up killing myself or killing him & a bit of his new girlfriend.

That mf needs to rot in hell,"Di ko alam saan ako magsisimula.



My mom saw a video on Tiktok about a mother who made her daughter confess who was the first guy she slept with. My mom was playing around my sister who’s now 19 years of age. Tinanong nya sister ko. Palagi iniiba usapan hanggang sa sumabay ako at tinanong ko na rin sino nga ba. Bigla sya napaiyak tas natahimik kami ni Mama kasi joke lang naman yun. Pwedi naman di sya sumagot. Habang umiiyak, she confessed “si Papa”


She is not his biological daughter. Anak sya ni mama sa labas. Sila pa ni papa nun nagkaanak si mama sa half-sister ko. He would come home from work before and he would ask my mom for food kahit wala naman income mama ko nuon. Full time mother and wife sya. Some guy took a liking to my mom. They had a baby at eto na nga yung sister ko. This new guy took care of all of us kahit nga papa ko nakikikain sa mga pinamigay nya. May trabaho naman sya pero halos araw araw naglalasing or palagi nanlilibre sa barkada tapos kami na pamilya nya walang makain. Grabe hirap ng buhay namin dati. Mom’s affair didn’t last at lumayo si new guy. My father continued being a drug-addict for years, a rapist (nasabi dati ni mama na pinipilit sya makipag sex kahit ayaw ni mama) lahat ng bisyo napasukan nya. He even caught STD from sleeping with a gay person at naipasa nya sa mama ko. Naagapan namin agad and my mom
was treated. My siblings and I were physically abused bata pa lang kami. He only stopped nung nag college na ako. The long years of physical, mental and emotional abuse we got from him was beyond words I can describe. Once, he almost chopped off my entire left shoulder with a big axe. Di ko matandaan ano kasalanan ko nun kasi bawat galaw namin pinapagalitan kami ng kapatid ko. Ang di nya lang nagawa ay pagbuhatan ng kamay yung mama ko kasi palaban naman si mama lagi nya napapahiya si papa tuwing nag aaway sila. My mom couldn’t go to work kasi sakitin sya at hindi nakapagtapos ng pag aaral so mula nung nagkaanak sila ni papa, she left her job at di na bumalik. If only we had the choice to leave my father, tagal na sana namin ginawa. Kasi nga walang wala kami, kahit relatives namin hindi tumutulong. They would hear us crying as kids from being physically beaten by my dad and no one would intervene to stop him. 


Tinanong namin ni mama yung sister ko bakit hindi sya nagsumbong samin na ni-rape pala sya ng papa ko since she was not even 10 years old. Sabi nya tiniis nya daw lahat kasi he threatened her na papatayin kaming lahat pag nagsumbong sya. I don’t doubt that he could do this. Sa kahayupan nun lahat magagawa nya. My sister kept her mouth shut and continued to be raped for more than 5 years. He was never caught. Magaling sya magtago hindi nga yun nakulong not even once nung nag drugs pa sya. Natigil lang ang panggagahasa nya sa kapatid ko nung 2017 and in the next 2 years, inatake sa puso at namatay while in Manila for work. Taga Cebu kami.


He died and got away with his arseholery. My sister broke free from his abuse but she will forever carry her trauma for the rest of her life. The day he died, I was surprised I didn’t shed a single tear. I was relieved pa nga. I couldn’t explain why, eto pala yun. I’ve always hated this man. Napakahayup nya para gawin yun sa bata… sa kapatid ko. No way in hell would we pay a visit to him in the cemetery again. Ipagdasal nya sarili nya sa impyerno. My little brother still looks up to him. I feel like he should never know this. It will only break him. 



I don’t know how to navigate life from this point. My sister.. who I love so dearly, nababoy ng sarili kong ama for many many years. My mom and I can only cry and blame ourselves why we couldn’t save my sister. We failed her. I can never forgive myself for this and I wish that mf would die many times in hell and experience the hell he deserves.

I’m tired of the heartache I feel in this home.,"I don’t think I was ever heard or was asked about how I felt. Even though I had to endure many years of verbal and emotional abuse in my childhood. I was told na “intindihin na lang” ganito ganyan. I am sad for myself that I had to grow up here. This environment here has so much tension and hostility, mostly caused by my mother. Now it’s not directed towards me, but to my grandmother because she doesn’t know how to be nice to her. 

I do not want the life she introduced me to. I want to move abroad na. AS IN. My biggest fear is growing old here. 

I know I could easily find jobs abroad, but I work as a graphic designer and unfortunately there aren’t a lot of creative jobs abroad for me (or willing to sponsor). Hindi ko na kaya. I do not want to be here anymore. I want to experience a peaceful and gentle home.

I hate my boyfriend's fraternity. So. Much.,"I love my boyfriend so much but lately I can't stand his behaviour. His org, his fraternity, takes pride in their application process which involves psychologically hazing and hurling emotional abuse to its applicants. It also interferes with their acads which is already mentally draining to begin with. The whole idea is to break their applicants down psychologically, emotionally, and mentally so that they can see who can withstand pressure and will be worthy of joining their org. There's no physical abuse, but they are made to do physically draining tasks and military-like exercises. I know a lot of orgs do these kind of application processes, but that doesn't make it okay at all and his seems to be longer in duration and stronger in intensity than the average org. It's all so unnecessarily cruel. 

I hated this org when he applied, as I felt like it was putting so much pressure on him when he already had a lot of change to deal with. I hated to think that he was being shouted at, humiliated, forced to do tasks that he would normally be embarrassed to do; plus there was so much to do that it took away a substantial time that could have been used for rest or to study for acads. To the point that he would get physically sick from exhaustion. All in the guise of creating a support system and friends. 

Now that he's no longer an applicant, but a facilitator,  it's all so much worse. How could he be okay with shouting at his juniors? Making them do embarrassing, tiring, menial, and at the same time physically and emotionally draining tasks. To the point that some of the applicants break down or self harm themselves to cope with the pressure. How could he not see the hypocrisy of wanting to be each other's ""family"" but the same time hazing these people? I hate it. I hate knowing that he is capable of bullying, and worse that he can't see that it's bullying. He is justifying all of it; that it is necessary, effective. I hate the self righteousness of it all.

I can't hide my emotions (no poker face at all) so he can always tell that I am not thrilled when he tells me about his org activities. I am trying to be supportive and understanding so as to avoid possible arguments but I just can't yet control my emotions. Yet I can't be open about it as much as I would like,  how much I hate this org, because he LOVES this org. He LOVES this org so much. It is his support system and barkada. How could I possibly take that away from him?? 

So I am left to swallow my comments, my thoughts, and my judgement as often as I can stand, so we won't fight about it. 

Tonight however I feel like I might explode from frustration so let me get this off my chest, PH.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/162u822/i_hate_my_boyfriends_fraternity_so_much/,t2_i1n45wjls,2023-08-28 00:00:56,14

Pinatawad ko sya ng diko na alam ilang beses
Pero habang tumatagal lumalala Yung mga ginagawa nya umabot na sya sa Puntong nanakit Kasi nahuhuli ko sya sa mga ginagawa nya

My Abusive Family's Financial Problem Is Giving Me Severe Anxiety,"A little context: I've been working for about several years now. After dealing with years of abuse from my own family, especially from my mom, I decided to live alone. Eventually, I met my life partner and created our own family. My mom had millions of loans that she was trying to get me to pay. I didn't agree. She's very emotionally abusive and will gaslight me para lang mapasunod ako sa gusto nya. Dati lagi akong umiiyak kapag ginagawa nya sakin yun, but I went numb. I still give her monthly allowance dahil it's my responsibility. IDK why, but my mom would tell her partner and siblings na parang pinapabayaan namin sya. It's always the victim mindset. Sobrang nakakapagod tulungan sya. Pero wala along choice kase tulungan ko sya or hindi, ako parin and magiging masama.

&#x200B;

Now, both my mom and my sister (who also emotionally abused me) got into a very bad situation where they solely rely on me for financial help. My sister got sick and not able to work while my mom makes small money from her little business. I admit the money that I'm sending them is not enough for what they need. Their monthly needs costs about 50,000 pesos and I'm trying to provide what I can. I'm at the point where I'm contemplating of working abroad even if I really don't want to. Mind you, I earn way above the usual salary here in the PH. My salary is around 80k. But it's not enough to make the ends meet with my responsibilities. I really don't know what to do to the point I'm having panic attacks and severe anxiety. I can't sleep most of the time and have been having really bad nightmares. I can't answer my mom's calls most of the time because of this. I've been rage applying to jobs. My husband even want to learn my job so that he can help me when I apply for an additional full time job. I feel defeated. Any advise? What should I do?

Violence Against Men,"TW: Physical Abuse

It just feels disappointing that men have no legal protection against any form of abuse or domestic violence. I (M31) had an ex gf who used to hurt me physically, and it occurred many times. Note that I did not cheat on her nor committed any grave offense against her. But everytime her emotions piled up, she used to hurt me physically, as in I got slaps on my face, arm, etc. 

After 9 months, I called it quits. I did not stand the abuse anymore.

But sadly i learned the hard way that the phrase good guys always end up last is definitely true. Its hard to trust and go out there again. Sometimes i think it would be best for me to just be alone. They prefer someone that would just use and abuse them emotionally and physically. Now i wonder is there still a place for nice guys to get the girl and end up first.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/162yq2d/im_tired_of_being_a_nice_guy/,t2_dx7mzir0w,2023-08-28 02:57:23,93

Sister bonds really make me envious,"I'm so fucking tired of being the emotional punching bag. Growing up, I have always let my older sister be, I never tried to create a bond with her kasi lagi niya akong sinasakit physically even though i am five years younger than her. I was a kid, and still inintindi ko actions niya as my older sister. I thought we'd eventually build a relationship just like any other sisters I know once we get older. But no, it just got worse. 

i just want to know where does her hatred of me stems from? I've never been one to fight back, sinusunod ko naman mga utos niya, i help her out when she needs help. Pero bakit? Bakit ang laki ng galit mo sakin, ate? She'd go home from school, see something na hindi ko naman kasalanan and still blame it on me. I know some of you will say, ""The oldest child has it harder"" but is that really a valid reason for her to literally verbally and sometimes physically abuse me? 

I've grown to just accept na ako yung emotional punching bag mo, pero sometimes it still hurts, you know? Especially kapag si Mama na ang nagtatanong kung bakit ba napakalaki ng galit niya sakin. 

What wrong did I ever do to you? Why do you treat me this way?",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/18ixyur/sister_bonds_really_make_me_envious/,t2_hxm1t57vw,2023-12-15 19:24:37,1
(28F) Napakahirap growing up with an abusive father.,"The violent and sudden angry outbursts I witnessed since I was a child, yung mom ko battered wife due to his paranoia (napaka seloso), nakatikim kaming magkakapatid ng physical abuse kahit walang dahilan para ikagalit niya. Noon inisip ko tuwing ma tri-trigerred siya maging violent na sana mas mabuti pa walang ama kaysa ganoon, noong nilayasan namin siya ilang beses hindi na sana nakipag reconcile mom ko everytime na susuyin niya kami for the sake of not being called ""a broken family"". Eh di sana happy kami na wala siya sa buhay namin, may freedom from emotional harm at wala ng source of misery.

Mahirap especially as a babae ma re-realize mo na kaya pala na a-attract mo ay yung mga cheaters, uncaring, heartless partners kasi deep inside your subconscious yun ang alam mong ""love"" growing up.

Why do we love the people who don’t love us back?,"Miss ko na ex ko, kahit hindi naman dapat. Noong kami pa, bare minimum lang binigay niya. Mas gugustuhin pa nya magfocus sa games niya pag magkasama kami sa condo niya. Yung chat din namin bago kami nagbreak, nanlalamig na on his end. Konti lang effort niya tapos makakatanggap pako ng emotional abuse. Legit na trauma nakuha ko sa kanya na ngayon naiintindihan ko na yung “therapy after meeting a boy” videos. Hindi naman ako walang sala at may naging faults ako pero grabe talaga lesson learned yung mga may history ng toxic/crazy exes malalaman mo kung bakit hahaHAHAHHAh emz. Hanggang ngayon, hindi ko pa rin masabi kung minahal ba niya ko. 

So bakit hanggang ngayon mahal ko pa rin siya? Ayaw ko siyang mamiss kasi alam ko naman deep inside na hindi ito deserve ko. Pero bakit ako niloloko ng damdamin ko?

"Same situation, same mistakes..","I used to beg God to get me out of a bad relationship because I'm pretty much bad at getting out on my own. I don't know what to do, I don't know what to say, and I don't know how. I am the type of partner that I'll give all the chances, I'll think of all the positivity, and I'll love real-hard. That's why as much as I could, I will literally stay through thick and thin, ups and downs, happy or sad. And even I'll cry every single night, I will still stay.

7 years later, here I am again, begging for God to help me get through a very toxic relationship. Same type of guy.. a Scorpio.

For some reason, I'm a Scorpio magnet, yet when I'm in a relationship with them, I am mentally and emotionally abused. Yet again, as I've said, I give all the chances and positivity I have in me even if I know in the end, it will never work.

We're turning 2 this year, and it's just the 2nd month of the year, yet here I am, begging God to help me get through this very very tough time.

I can't see and feel that he's gonna change for the better ever again.

Boundaries in Family Relationships,"Have you ever get irritated sa tuwing sinasabi sa inyong ""Tatay/Nanay mo pa din yan"".
I feel like they use ""family"" as a free pass to be an asshole. 

Just a context, my dad and I drifted apart when I turned 19. This is because I've been emotionally and sexually abused by him as a child. My mom died when I was 10 and ever since then, the abuse started. 
I never spoke up about it because I thought it was my fault and I was so scared to lose another parent. 
But after I graduated college, we had a big fight about all the things he did to me and I was victim blamed by him. 
After that, we didn't talk for almost 4 years. 

We recently reconnected when my grandfather died last year. Civil kami and I still remain respectful even after everything that happened. I am getting the help that I need and because of that I was able to build boundaries. 

I promised myself na hindi ko na hahayaang matakot at saktan pa ako. 
I only talk to him pag kapatid ko na pinag-uusapan. 
Fast forward to last weekend, I got into a vehicular accident. 
I was lucky that my injuries weren't serious but I had to stay at the hospital for three days. 
I informed him about it out of courtesy. 
He never even visited nor ask me how I was. 
He only communicated through his wife (yes, he remarried and I believe my stepmom is emotionally abused as well) 

Then today, he got mad about a choice that I made. Suddenly, he called me ungrateful, selfish, and disrespectful. 
He said that he was so disappointed at me. 

Honestly, I wasn't hurt. I was angry. 
Angry that he had the audacity to call me all those names despite being independent, liberated, and successful at my age (F24). 
Yes, I replied back.
I made sure that my message is respectful enough. 

Sabi ko doon ""Shouldn't you be more disappointed at yourself because you have so much to improve on as a father and a human being?""
I even suggested that he seeks a mental health professional because how he acts and responds is not normal anymore. 

But of course, I knew he'll retaliate by telling me that I'm ungrateful and rude. He even threatened me na wag ko na daw sya kausapin and wag pumunta sa libing niya. 

It's such a relief that I got him out of my life. This was the last straw. There's so much trauma and pain he caused me. Being biologically related doesn't mean that I have to be treated like this. 

It took so much time and energy to get to where I am. I feel like I have taken back the power he removed from me when I was by his side. 

So Redditors out there who's with a toxic family member, do not be afraid to cut them out of your life. Having him out of my life is like a breathe of fresh air. This is freedom.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/17axqed/boundaries_in_family_relationships/,t2_e6b0lr9r,2023-10-19 02:30:11,2
My brother hugged me for the first time,"Backstory; I was a horrible big brother to this kid. I bullied him when we were younger and poured my frustrations of high school life/drama/insecurities onto him. Add in the fact I was raised in an EXTREMELY homophobic household (my brother came out as gay). Legit, I got my ass beat by my dad because I was good in (from his words) 'gay' subjects like general studies, english, etc. And sucked at MANLY subjects like math and science. (he's changed now, don't worry) but yeah, just an idea of how toxic our household is. My brother and I took the most beating from our parents, actually my brother did because there were times I hit him too. More times than I can count. He was a kid that always gets in trouble so he kept getting his ass beat. Can't blame him though, of how shitty we treated him, he had to blow steam off somehow. I didn't know this back then. In Psychology, there's a name for that, the ONE family member that takes ALL the shit but I forgot the actual name of it. Anyways my brother is that guy. I treated him like shit, just like all of my family members did for a long time. Till he grew up and the verbal abuse kinda stopped? At least for us siblings. My parents still kinda like that to him sometimes. 

Fast forward to years later. I've become aware of my actions and all that. We were ok for a few years but not close like how siblings can be sometimes. Until he moved in with me a couple of weeks ago. 

Something bad happened at work and I tried to help him and we talked for a couple of hours and he ended up crying. I hugged him and he kept on crying. 

I said it's okay. 
Just let it all out. 
Nothing wrong with that. I know that what happened hurts and that life is kinda shitty sometimes that things like this happens. 

After the whole ordeal, as I went to bed, he was just standing in my doorway and he was stuttering and anxious. I went over to him and he said he was feeling emotional but he had his arms and hands halfway open like he wanted a hug. 

THIS KID WANTED A HUG BUT HE DIDN'T KNOW HOW. 

So I gave him a hug and he wrapped his arms around me SO TIGHT and I realized he's never hugged me like this. It was always a half hug when we say goodbye and shit like that. 

Not like this. 

It was at this moment, I felt like he forgave me for all the physical and verbal abuse I threw at him. He said he used to be so scared of me as a kid. I carried that weight for a long time until he hugged me like this. 

He said he's never showed emotions in front of anyone because honestly, growing up in that toxic household, emotions were deemed weak. He said that this is the first time he ever truly felt comfortable opening up. 

I teared up knowing that all the years I was away my brother didn't have anybody to hold him like this and tell him that it's going to be okay. 

Jesus Christ. Our parents really fucked us up. 

This upbringing of conservative/orthodox asian household needs to stop. 

Anyways, that's all folks. Till the next emotional revelation! 

P. S. If you and your siblings fight, let it go. We shouldn't treat our siblings like how our parents treated us. Let's end this generational upbringing of abuse.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/z7zeyk/my_brother_hugged_me_for_the_first_time/,t2_cbwejcgd,2022-11-30 00:57:32,136
Guilt after break up,"Kinakain ako ng guilt lately.

Just for context, I (29) ended my 9-yr realationship with the father (33) of my kids. We have three children. It’s been three months since I decided to end things with him. He is narcissistic manipulator and he has the same traits as my mom. So mom blames me for not giving my kids a complete family. Recently pinagmumura nya (mom) ako. Saying wala akong kwentang nanay. Kinuha kasi ng tatay mga bata kasi sembreak naman, and don’t want to deal the “silence” at home. So I am now staying at a friends house. Just having some time for myself. Kasi alam ko na if I stayed home, it will lead to depression.

I know my ex and mom has been contacting nonstop since pavictim nga ang ex ko. For 7 years we stayed and sa side ng ex ko, nakabukod but malapit sa family nya. Sa loob ng 7 yrs, 3 yrs non disrespect, mental and emotional abuse nakuha ko. The next 4 years was me realizing it was not worth it, but still continued to hope na magbago sya. Na he would see my worth. But no. We decided to move sa house ng mom ko sa probinsya since wala nakatira. the last two years… exit plan. 

And I did it. In that entire 7 years na nagstay ako with him. I don’t open up sa family ko kung ano nangyayarii, kasi I know they have their own burden. I post sa soc med na we are a happy family. Little did they know that I mostly cried at night, while someone beside me is deeply asleep, snoring. As if he was mocking me even if he was asleep.

I am now seeing someone. It was not easy for my ex to accept that. He called me a whore. They (ex and mom) called me a whore. And I know, I have said that “ako muna” and there is nothing wrong with choosing yourself. But tbh, their words affect me. And I hate it. 

How not to be affected?",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1adq0rm/guilt_after_break_up/,t2_a23tjxxv,2024-01-29 15:54:31,19

Now that my relative has gain an achievement,  gusto nya kami rin.

Gumastos ako last year to seek help from a psychologist kasi sa mga emotional abuse nya amin na mga anak nya. (my mom is a house wife) maybe that's why sometimes I think naiinggit din sya at my mga work kami.

MY ABUSIVE EX BOYFRIEND IS RUNNING FOR SK.,"trigger warning // mentions sexual harassment, rape and abusive relationship

I’m going to post this here kasi sobrang sama talaga ng loob ko ever since I (21F) saw several posters of my ex (22M) plastered all over our barangay and found out that he really was running for SK thru a friend of mine. Naiinis ako because hindi niya deserve. Hindi niya deserve maging SK Kagawad. Hindi niya deserve ang suporta na binibigay sa kanya ngayon ng mga taga-rito samin.

Every time that I see his stupid fucking face, nagagalit ako at naaalala ko kung paano niya ako trinato nung kami pa. From bullying me, physically, verbally and emotionally abusing me, and on top of that, sexually harassing and raping me, hindi niya talaga deserve maging SK Kagawad. Every time that I see his poster na naka-ngiti, I want to rip that poster and burn it. Worst of all, dahil maliit lang ang mundo, I see my facebook friends sharing the posts he uploaded while doing community service na ang caption ay “si (ex) ang SK ko! baka SK ko yan! serbisyong mabait at tapat!” and I can’t help but roll my eyes, dahil hindi naman totoo na mabait siya; and those same people are the ones na nag-push sa ex ko to sexually harass me for him to “be a real man and let go of celibacy”.

Your SK Kagawad fucking abused me throughout our 5-year relationship and here I am, two years later, still healing from the trauma he fucking left. Ang hirap lang, tangina. One minute I tell myself that I’m fine, the second I’m mad and crying dahil naalala ko lahat ng ginawa niya. Ang hirap lang kasi I remember speaking up about what he did to me, yet I ended up becoming the bad person dahil “mabait” at catechist siya sa simbahan – mas maraming naniniwala sa kanya, kesa sakin at hinding-hindi niya kayang gawin ang mga sinabi ko dahil anak siya ng Diyos, lol. Your SK Kagawad made me feel small, pakiramdam ko napaka-dumi kong tao sa mga pinaggagawa niya sakin throughout the whole duration of our relationship. Tangina, yang SK Kagawad niyo magaling mag-baliktad ng storya!

Your SK kagawad is a liar, abusive and rapist. He’s a fucking bastard, he doesn’t deserve that position. Kung siya ang future ng city na to o ng barangay na to, tangina.

I want to run away but I'm scared.,"TW: physical, and emotional abuse mention

(Sorry for the wrong Filipino terms English is my first language even if I'm half-Filo)

Hi, 18 na ako since last year pa - turning 19 this year. Trans male ako, I knew since I was a teen pa. I live in a upperclassmen home, no rent just bills but I want to run away and go somewhere far far from my family.

 I have been abused since I was a kid, my dad had a bad temper cause of his own dad. He would hit us when we did something wrong, or yell at us if we didn't do it quick enough or right in his eyes. He has lessened the physical violence since we're older now, but won't hesitate to shout and cuss us out if we don't meet his standards.

I live with my mom, brother (24M), sister (19F), and dad's side in the house. Hindi ako pwede umalis without permission, kasi girl ako. My sister is treated much worse, as a black sheep for some reason hindi ko alam why. She is a good student, very loud but very bubbly to everyone, really nice. Yet my mom doesn't like her, says she's being influenced by her friends? but I know her friends, they're fine - just loud lang.

Just recently lang, my sister got too loud and was yelled at - told off for being a disturbance, kasi she got too heated in a game. My mom pulled her aside, and I won't go into detail, but she is in danger of getting kicked out.

I don't want her to leave, I don't know what I'd do without her kasi, but she's at risk of getting hurt before kicked out daw. I want her to be safe, but I don't want her to stay here too. Our home is very unstable but it's a good home outside of the family issues.

I only have debit and gcash but it's not enough if she leaves, I want to go with her if that happens, I don't want her to be alone. I want to get a job but not even allowed part time bc of college. Everything I own belongs to my family, aside from a few things that aren't important.

I want to keep her safe bc she raised me, but I don't want to get hurt and kicked out too. I want to support her in every way possible.  I'm not skilled in anything but drawing.

Sorry po if this is disorganized, I'm very worried for my sister and I needed to rant.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1b5elln/i_want_to_run_away_but_im_scared/,t2_ocddjwbam,2024-03-03 18:59:56,1

Stop procreating!!!,"I've been hating my life for the longest and suicidal. 

Here's why, 
Mom and dad is not emotionally matured enough to raise a loving family. 
My dad ended up cheating leaving my mom in misery, Became an OFW to support us. 
Our oldest brother end up being a criminal, My Oldest sister became the head of the family since dad no longer with us and mom is abroad. (She was just in 3rd year college btw) 
My other brother who is 5years older than me plays the victim role and the bully alternately. 
I am the punching bag. 

- I grew up having a conflicted personality coz I always need to be conscious with the way I behave, They are easily irritated and gets angry. My childhood years was like walking on eggshells, constant fear and anxiety. 

- I thought that my emotion never matter since I am always invalidated growing up. 

- We were poor and my sister needs to sacrifice her studies for us. 

- My sister lived in with her partner, I end up living with my brother which was hell. I always cry at night, He screams at me all the time and verbally abused me, Physical abuse was also present. I thought all families are like this. 

- Present- I am now 29, living faw away,  No plans to get married or have kids,  Why? I still have all the traumas in me. I still hear voices in my head. I have issues socializing, I still cry, I dunno bounderies, I am so hard on myself everytime I fail on something. I even caught myself repeating the behavior of my brother to my colleagues. I feel so mentally fucked up in life. 

I am writing this to whoever may read this to please THINK a million times before you procreate. 
Ask yourself if you can give your child a complete loving and supportive family, Financial support and emotional support. 

You might not see the bigger effects of this neglects yet, but try to dig deep why there are psychopaths, sociopaths or increased with  depression cases,  uproductive prople of the society etc. 

I am speaking from a perspective of a neglected child who constantly fights depression, traumas and urge of wanting to k*ll someone/myself. I never wanted to be born anyways. What choice do I have coming to this world. 

 Educate yourself and stop procreating if you're not ready.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/18oei18/stop_procreating/,t2_oou8dbe7,2023-12-22 21:06:14,1

But here's the catch, he's 2 years separated no communication (pinagpalit sya and hurt by his wife emotionally and sometimes physically) but can't annul his wife since INC sila. He holds on to his faith with INC so much. Di nya kaya matiwalag. 

Nga pala, alam naman ng both families and relatives relasyon namin pero except sa church nya at sa pamilya ng asawa nya. As for me, maaga ako na biyuda kaya wala naman problem kung magpakasal ulit. Both kami never pa nagkaanak. My life was already full of challenges. Emotionally abused ako sa marriage ko and looks like si Lord ang gumawa ng way na makawala ako dun. And many more. 
Tapos ngayon, nakilala na namin ang isa't isa, sobrang pagmamahal nabibigay namin for each other. Masaya sya kasi kahit mataas pinagaralan ko (I'm doing PhD, he doesn't have bachelor's degree) and mas mataas ang estado sa buhay, I never looked down on him and I always have high regards for him. 

Mahirap iexplain kung gaano nakakahinayang yung love na papakawalan ko kasi alam namin na di na namin makikita yun sa iba. 

Btw, I chose to stay kasi sa ilang beses na muntik na din ako mamatay (lapitin ng accidents kasi) at nung December nabundol naman ako ng sasakyan, at sa dami ng obstacles na nalagpasan ko, I feel like I deserve na makuha yung love and happiness. 

Nakakalungkot we cannot be together because of so much complications ng batas ng tao at batas ng relihiyon niya. 
Pero kung tutuusin, wala na kami masasagasaan na tao kasi wala kaming anak, at wala na kaming ka relasyon. 

Please don't comment hurtful words, medyo nadedepress na ako at the moment. Sabi kasi ng friends ko hiwalayan mo na. Although sabi ng mga older colleagues ko, give it time.

Sana sa next lifetime, magkita kami at pwede na kami magmahalan ng walang complications.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1acrq6s/forbidden_perfect_love/,t2_si9xywk6i,2024-01-28 10:18:38,18
Meron bang tatay na hindi mainitin ang ulo,"Nakakafrustrate lang, feeling ko buong buhay ko kinailangan ko magdeal sa anger issues ng tatay ko. Di siya physically abusive, pero emotionally abusive sya. Ginagawa akong sounding board sa mga problema nya at puro rant sa mga kapatid niyang paulit ulit. Napakabilis magalit, parang ang hirap gumalaw sakanya minsan, iniisip ko palagi may magagawa akong mali. 

Kung kailan akala ko narerepair na relationship namin kasi unti unti ko na syang napapatawad sa trauma na binigay nya sakin nung pagkabata hanggang college, narerealize ko paring di siya nagbago. Andun parin anger issues nya na madali lang biglang magresurface. 

Nagvolunteer pa syang turuan ako magmaneho, pero ang dali lang nya mafrustrate at magalit tuwing di ko nagegets kagad. 

Naiinggit talaga ako sa mga taong close sa tatay nila o kaya mag tatay na sobrang patient sakanila at di mainitin ang ulo. Sobrang foreign tlga ng concept sakin na may ganung tatay pala. Yung makakausap mo nang maayos, mashasharean ng problema, yung emotionally mature enough na kayang macontrol galit nila at maging patient sayo. 

Sobrang sama ko para sabihin to, pero sana iba nalang naging tatay ko.

EDIT: Naiyak ako pagkatapos ng driving lessons. Mas gugustuhin ko nlng magextend ng hours sa driving school kesa magtiis sa ganitong pagtuturo. Sa sobrang inis ko naiyak ako sa harapan nya, di ko man lang napigil hnggang pag uwi.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/xxtu0m/meron_bang_tatay_na_hindi_mainitin_ang_ulo/,t2_pqp2m9ro,2022-10-07 16:43:32,8
My dad became a trigger to me,"title. i still live with my parents and the more i grow older, i realized that he became my trigger. idk why but i am scared of him (though, baka at this point i really am im just not admitting it to myself). his presence scares me and the things he does - anger issues, physical and emotional abuse sksk. my mental health is deteriorating the longer i stay here but i cant go anywhere since im still an undergrad student. To compensate, i work and support myself by going to therapy but recently my therapist changed our sessions to weekly since my 'episodes' were more frequent. I think i cant afford weekly therapy on my own huhu :< 

it is just so sad that ""daddy eyes"" when i was younger is not there anymore and everything changed. my home is not really a home. i wish i could just stay in that ""daddy eyes"" forever.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/zmmb2b/my_dad_became_a_trigger_to_me/,t2_h1oelc6v,2022-12-15 22:24:46,2
We need to normalize leaving abusive families.,"Too many of my friends, and I'm certain, good people elsewhere, lose themselves because they chain themselves down to families that abuse and exploit them. I'm sick of hearing about how many of them got into vices, started cutting themselves, doing drugs, considered su1cid3 etc etc etc, because they couldn't find it in themselves to leave their families. So they just deal with the abuse, whether be it physical, emotional, financial, or whatever. These are good people. They don't deserve this.

Don't go making children just to mess them up,"Please, guys. Don't go making children just to make them your retirement plan, emotional punching bag, trophy kid, display, paper dolls or whatever. Make kids and let them live the life they want.

&#x200B;

I am 27 now, unmarried (but in a long term relationship) and very messed up because of my parents. Walang pangarap sa buhay tatay ko nuong nagsasama pa sila ni Mama and lasinggero siya. My mom naman ay lalakero na egocentric, mentally abusive at hindi ako ang priority nuon. Lola ko lang dahilan kaya matino pa akong kausap ngayon. 

&#x200B;

As of now, ako retirement plan ni Papa at official mental punching bag ng mama ko. Magkahiwalay na sila matagal na. I also have sisters sa bagong pamilya ni Mama and sila rin ay emotional punching bag ng mama ko. 

&#x200B;

My dad lacks money, knowledge and dreams. I love him pero I hate how he put me into this predicament. My mom naman ay your usual toxic mom na egocentric na boomer. MAyaman sila ng asawa niya pero hindi ako priority ni mama. She'd rather support her siblings than me.

it's a dead end.,"Currently, I've been going through a lot of stuff. I feel like I do not have a purpose in this world anymore. Feeling ko dead end ang lahat. I have no more hopes of having my own family because of the current situation we are in, not interested on having a relationship anymore. I'm at that age na I'm tired of dating? If that's a thing? My career is going well, but I feel like I'm abanoded by everyone. I don't speak to my family anymore because of the emotional abuse that I'm experienced from them.

My husband blames me for EVERYTHING.,"He blames me for his depression. He was already troubled when we met and was diagnosed clinically depressed when I encouraged him to seek professional help. 

He blames me when can’t work. I know it’s depressing being alone, but what choice did we have? I didn’t want our child to live in a shack inside his shop. Call me maarte but it wasn’t a good neighborhood either and he often left us alone. 

He blames me for all the mental and emotional abuse I experienced from him. He can’t control his temper. Almost every word that I say is a trigger. I never cursed at him or called him names, or said hurtful things even when we had disagreements. I felt so worthless. He would often say that I am a useless wife. We were together for 6 years. For the last 3 years, I just kept quiet whenever we had arguments. It was still a trigger for him. 

He blames me for his bad financial decisions. He doesn’t tell me when he plans to invest on something. He just does it. It would ALWAYS come as a surprise and when these investments fail, he blames me. I don’t even touch his money. I don’t know how much he earns. 

He still blames me for the physical abuse I experience from him. We had a financial disagreement because I found out from his mom that he was planning to buy a vehicle with no papers. I just told him not to, in the calmest way. He still got it and hit me while I was carrying our baby. I called my parents to pick me up. Baby and I lived far from him for more than a year (and this was during the height of the pandemic) and he blames me for not witnessing our child grow up. I still forgave him for this and he got a house without my consent and we just had to move back because I didn’t want to waste it. 

He blames me for being alone. We lost our home. We lost our business because I couldn’t manage it well with a toddler. He just appointed me to manage it despite my objections. I was more concerned about our toddler’s health. It was the height of frequent lockdowns during this time. Our child and I had to move back to my parents” because we have no where to live and our debts racked up. I finished my own savings paying for his debts and our bills and needs. 

He blames me for being busy. I was able to find a good paying job and I’m slowly able to pay all our debts. He rarely provides financial support. I only get 3k every other month from him, while he was able to buy some “luho” and these are not cheap. If I don’t work., nothing gets paid on time. 

He blames me for ruining his life. He had dreams for us. I told him that I didn’t want to go back because there aren’t any good schools where we used to live. It was in the province. I can finally afford to send my child to an exclusive private school. Wouldn’t you want what’s best for your child? I was also worried about the toxic environment when we lived together. He would shout and curse at me in front of our child. 

He blames me for having low self-esteem. I just didn’t have the libido to have seggs because apart from taking care of our kid and managing our former business, I had to do ALL the chores. I was very, very tired. We used to have an active seggs life, but it dwindled down since I gave birth. I was also experiencing PPD. Every time we do it, I felt forced. He would often tell me that I don’t love him and that I wasn’t attracted to him anymore. He felt ugly. 

He recently called it quits and blamed it on me. He threatened that he would unalive himself and record it and leave messages to people blaming me because I was the reason for his misery. He would threaten me with this almost every week before we broke up. I agreed to the break up and he still had the nerve to blame me for quitting on him. He said that I didn’t deserve him. He said that I deserve someone who will cheat on me and physically abuse me. He thinks he’s perfect because he’s very faithful. 

He refuses to seek professional help. He used to see a psych and took meds for months, but decided to just stop. 

I am tired of all the mental and emotional abuse. He snaps almost everyday. 

All I was thinking of was the upbringing of our child. I didn’t want the kid to grow up in a toxic environment. I would often encourage him to seek professional help together, but he would just say hurtful things. He often said that I am a useless wife. 

Call me stupid for keeping up with all of this. I KNOW I AM. I really deserved what I tolerated, but enough is enough. 

I am currently on a waiting list to see a professional. Thank you for reading.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/133x3vz/my_husband_blames_me_for_everything/,t2_6ay8amwjk,2023-05-01 00:59:47,1
Gusto ko nang mawala. Di na ko gagaling,"

27M here. Mayroon po akong MDR TB at wala po ako work now.  
Only child lang po ako. Mama ko lang nagpalaki sa akin. Bata pa lang ako iniwan na kami nang papa ko para sa kabit niya. I grew up without a father figure, mama ko lang nagpalaki sa kin. Nagbibigay naman siya kaso sobrang kulang and nun nagkaroon na siya nang anak dun sa kabet niya. Wala na talaga.

Since pinahinto ako mag aral. I fell into depression and lagi lang ako nakakulong sa kwarto ko having su\*cidal thoughts. Dahil wala rin kami pambayad nang renta napalayas kami nang mama ko sa inuunapahan namin at nakanap nang sobrang liit na upahan.

Nagkaroon ako nang contracture. Sabi nang doctor malaki chance na di na ko uli makakalad kahit i surgery pa. Over 1 year mahigit na kong baldado and dahil dun nag work yung mom since wala na tlaga sustento.

My grew up with a silver spoon and wala talaga siya alam na trabaho and for me nag work siya para mabuhay lang kami. Di kinaya nang mom ko yung stress sa work at yung situation ko na disabled na ko. Namatay yung mama ko for unknown cause. Pabago bago sinasabi nang doctor sabi nung una tb pero paiba iba. Namatay mama ko sa inuupahan namin habang may sakit at baldado ako. 2019 ito

  
Kinuha ako nang papa ko nung namatay mama ko. Emotionally abusive papa ko and di ko kaya makisama sa kabit niya at mga anak nun. Kaya when I was miraculously cured without any medical intervention 4 months after mamatay mom ko. Nag work ako and umalis dun.

  
I was living alone and I was trying to to become the best version of myself and fix mylife. Fast forward around 2022 ma promote ako sa team manager pero yung sahod pang ahente pa rin. Sa sobrang focus ko sa work. Nabayaan ko health ko.

  
After few months tinamaan ako nang tb. Di ko ine expect kasi di nman ako sakitin and kahit nung lahat nagka covid na sa office di ako nagkaroon. Kaya nung sumusuka ako nang dugo at naging 38kg ako kala ko kukunin na ako.

  
I mesaaged my father to reconcile with him thinking maybe he wasn't that bad at all and at least pag n\*matay ako ililibing ako katabi ko mama ko.

  
I was in the ICU for a month and I didn't d\*e but now I need to be on oxygen for 24/7. I can't afford that.  
My father is abusing me emotionally and physically. Sabi niya mam@tay na lang daw ako nag try pa siya balian ako nung buto nung nagpupumilit ako magpala sa hospital dahil sobrang hirap kuna huminga. Di lang yan instance niya na sinaktan ako.

  
In and out ako sa hospital. Last time pinalabas ako nang hospital kahit wala pa ako oxygen sa bahay and sabi ban na daw ako dahil wala pambayad. Wag daw magpala sa hospital pag wala pambayad.

  
Wala may trabaho sa min. Matagal na tambay papa ko since pandemic wala siya work. Ang may work lang is yung kabet niya and pag may pera pinangsusugal lang.

  
Nakikitira ako ngayon sa kabit nang papa ko. Di ko na a adhere yung gamutan sa tb since di nman ako makakain maayos and sobrang hapdi sa tiyan nang tb meds pag walang kain not to mention other side effects.

  
Ngayon di na naman ako makahinga at ubo nang ubo at panay suka. Di ko alam kung pwede ako i admit nang mag isa lang lalo wala akong pambayad. Wala akong work. Di ko na alam gagawin ko. May onting lakas pako ang nakakalad pa ako di tulad nang mga last admission ko.  I was thinking the best way to exit painlessly and fast. Dun ko na lang uubsin huling lakas ko. Kung binasa mo lahat.

Although, minsan I found myself zoning out in mid-convos lalo na pag disappointing or sad yung kinukwento ng tao (also doing the finger-pressing) Sometimes, I am wondering if I am surpressing things para di ko mafeel to and just trying to protect my emotional and mental state.

Bound by Control,"It is challenging to make my mother, who is conservative and authoritarian, understand that I am growing up and have my own life to live. Throughout my upbringing, we were never emotionally close, as I have always felt suffocated by her strict rules and various forms of abuse and manipulation. She believes that since I still live under her roof, I have no right to make demands, dismissing everything I say as mere excuses and bluffs. She has built a wall between us, seeing me only as her daughter and herself as the mother.

abusive parent who threatens to s*ic*d*,"No child or partner should ever go through the experience of dealing with an abusive, narcissistic, manipulative parent. 

It's one of those nights again the whole family has to deal with a parent who threatens to unalive themselves over all these thoughts they project onto the rest of the family.

They feel unappreciated? That's because they've been verbally abusing everybody for pretty much all their lives then they act so confused as to why none of us shows affection. Treats them like trash because they don't have a job? That's their personal insecurities they project onto us when literally nobody treats them like so. We're unhelpful in the house? That's because we're constantly walking on eggshells when they switch from i dont need help gusto ko kayong pagsilbihan to putangina mga anak mayaman ba kayo. They feel that we dont listen and respect them? Honestly, at this point we don't anymore. Why would we do that when the parent doesn't listen, invalidates the effect of their abuse on us, and yet claims to be the victim and that everybody does nothing but hurt them. 

Living with an abusive parent is hell that those who didn't experience it HAVE NO FUCKING RIGHT to say ""we understand"", ""that's still your parent"" or ""you're an awful person for being angry towards them.""

The trauma, the lies, these nights where u have to restrain your abuser from unaliving themselves and then listen to all their hurt and pain but when they inflict the abuse to you, they justify it with various excuses. 

No child, husband or wife should ever go through this. The manipulation and guilt-tripping is cruel. 

If you've reached this point, i hope u dont marry to a person who is emotionally immature and just downright awful. Because when yall have kids, no child should have to parent their own parent and deal with all their emotional baggages. Kasi sa huli, pag dumating sa punto na gusto na nila mawala, dadalhin nyo yung guilt na kasalanan nyo pero ang totoo, desisyon naman talaga nila gawin lahat ng ginawa nila. 

You'd think I'd be angry at them for being like this. But honestly, im indifferent. They can do whatever they want, i honestly don't care. I'm more angry how the people i love around me isn't as detached as i am so they're still getting hurt.

Consider yourself blessed if you do not have to deal with an abusive parent,"Daming bagay na kinikimkim ko lang sa sarili ko mula bata ako kasi hindi naman pwedeng ikwento sa iba dahil sa ""background"" ng pamilya. Iniingatan ang reputasyon. Hindi pwedeng malaman ng iba na may nangyayaring family drama. Naalala ko, elementary pa ako sinabihan ako ng nanay ko na huwag ikwento sa mga kaklase ko kung may nangyayari mang gulo sa bahay. Kaya itinago ko lahat yun sa sarili ko. Naiintindihan ko naman bakit hindi pwede e.

Siguro college na ako nung una akong may napagkwentuhan na hindi perpekto ang pamilya ko. Noon ko rin unang nakwento sa iba ang analysis ko why I became who I am. Siguro sinisi ko rin ang magulang ko kung bakit ako naging ganito – cold, heartless, matigas. Pero wala na akong magagawa, ganito na ako. Tinanggap ko na lang. Di naman ako nagtanim ng galit sa magulang ko. Alam ko di naman din sila perpekto. Nung narealize ko yun, ako na lang ang nag-""parent"" sa sarili ko. Pinakauna kong narealize to grade 3 pa lang ako. Di na ko nagkikwento sa magulang ko ng kahit ano for fear that I might either upset them or I will just be invalidated again. Kaya mga problema, ako na lang umiisip ng solusyon. Kung takot ako, ako rin nagpapalakas ng loob ko. Kung malungkot ako, ako rin ang nag-aahon sa sarili ko.

My physiological and financial needs were taken care of, but my emotional needs weren't. I'm not ungrateful but I wish my emotional needs were taken into consideration too.

Nanay ko, emotionally abusive mula bata pa ako. Ang trauma nya nung lumalaki sya, sa akin naproject. Tangina, ako pa ngayon nag-aanalyze sa kanya para maintindihan ko sya. Pero di ko na talaga sya kaya. Lumaki syang sunud-sunuran sa magulang nya kasi yun daw ang pagiging ""mabuting anak."" Kahit sa aasawahin nya, magulang nya nagdesisyon para sa kanya. Hindi rin sya marunong magdesisyon para sa sarili. She's the most fickle-minded person I know. Pabago-bago ng iniisip, pabago-bago ng desisyon, ang daming nasasayang na oras. Kaya ganun din ang ginagawa nya sa akin, lahat ng gusto nya dapat sunud-sunuran lang ako. Pag hindi ako sumunod, hindi ako mabuting anak. Isa sa mga di ko makakalimutan na pagiging emotionally abusive nya ay sabihan ako na mamamatay na raw sya, para lang makita nya akong umiyak. Pag naiisip ko yun ngayon, tangina, naiisip ko anong klaseng magulang ang magsasabi nun?

In 2020, dahil sa pandemic, I had to go back sa bahay namin dahil baka mag-apocalypse na. I was living independently for seven years before that. I was comfortable and happy with my life. I enjoyed freedom. Siguro one of my biggest regrets in life was returning back home. Nawalan ako ng trabaho. Pagbalik sa bahay, kinukulit nya ako maghanap ng trabaho. Hanap naman ako nang hanap, pero hindi natatanggap. Inisip ko sana di na lang ako bumalik kung paghahanapin lang din ako ulit ng trabaho kasi may trabaho naman ako nun e. Sobrang lala ng 2020, I only found comfort sa thought na I can end it anytime by killing myself.

Ngayon naman, one week after I failed the Bar Exam, I have to deal with this shit again. While waiting for the results, I thought I'd just kill myself if I don't pass. Ngayon buhay ako, pero I have to deal with my abusive nagger mother again. Ni hindi man lang ako binigyan ng time and space to grieve. Gusto nya makita lang ako ulit na nag-aaral. Putangina lang no. Nakakainggit yung ibang nagtake tapos sabi nila niyakap lang daw sila ng nanay nila nung nalaman na di sila pumasa. Buti pa sila. Ako sinisi ng magulang ko e. Tapos ngayon bawat galaw ko mino-monitor, bawal makita na gumagamit ng phone. E wala  nga akong makausap na matino at naiintindihan ako maliban sa mga taong nakakausap ko sa phone. Kung di dahil sa mga nakakausap kong kaibigan, baka nagpakamatay na lang ako.

Gusto ko na talaga umalis dito. Ang hirap lang dahil ang dami pang kailangang iconsider. Ang hirap sabihin sa akin na, ""umalis ka na lang"" kasi hindi naman ganun kadali yun. Fuck. Ang komplikado ng buhay ko. Buhay ako pero di ko maramdaman na ako ang nagpapatakbo ng sarili kong buhay. Ang tanda ko na. I already finished two degrees. Pero walang kwenta ang buhay ko. Mas marami ka pang maririnig na masama sa mga tao kapag nasa kalugmukan ka talaga kaysa pag nagtatagumpay ka.

Siguro bilib na lang ako na di ganun kasidhi ang kagustuhan ko ngayon na magpakamatay na lang. Although sa totoo lang yun na talaga ang totoong sagot sa lahat ng problema ko. Pero at least, di ko pa ginagawa kahit alam ko na kung paano ko gagawin.

Tangina tapos parang di pa pwedeng sumama ang loob ko. Parang I'm made to feel guilty pag galit ako. Pag tahimik, pinipilit magsalita. Pag nagsalita, di rin naman naiintindihan. Putangina. Alam ko naman kasi anong dapat maging takbo ng buhay ko e. Alam ko kung paano aayusin ang buhay ko. Ang problema: wala akong kalayaang gawin agad kung ano ang plano ko. Laging nakadepende sa external circumstances.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/12tkf6j/consider_yourself_blessed_if_you_do_not_have_to/,t2_ugb3qkq0,2023-04-21 08:25:24,7
Im afraid I’m a narcissist and it’s ruining my life.,"Somethings wrong with me and I don’t know what that is.

Recently I’ve been good at battling my anxiety and my thoughts, but right now it’s attacking me and I’m not sure what to do. For the past month I’ve been convinced I’m a narcissist and that I feel no empathy or guilt, I’ve learned everything about them and I can’t stop subconsciously comparing myself to what I’ve read. My body is consumed with cold sweats, I can’t stop shaking, and I’m getting easily agitated because my mind don’t stop telling me how much of a bad person I must be. Every thought I think is always questioned by my head, every action I do is questioned by my head, and I’m not sure what to do anymore. Every thing I do my head comes and tells me “are you being narcissistic? Are you doing this for attention? You’re probably manipulating them. Maybe you should run away from everyone so you don’t run the risk of hurting anyone ever again.” I’ve even gone as far as asking family members and friends if traits of narcissism fit me, and they all say no. My therapist even says in incredibly introspective and a good person, but some part of me fears that I tricked her into thinking that and in reality I must be a bad person. She’s told me that I tend to put others emotions/feelings before my own, and it’s caused me to not know who I am or how I feel, and that I tend to worry more about the feelings of other people even when they’re abusing me. She often says “facts over feelings” because apparently I’ll end up empathizing with my abuser or at least worrying more about how they’ll react than about my safety, and I struggle to leave abusive relationships and even attract them somehow, or abusive people are attracted to something about me. I’ve been told many times by my abusers that I’m incapable of anything, that I’m weak and don’t do anything, that I never tell them anything, etc. Some part of me worries that they’re right. I’ve even been so convinced they were right that I apologized to them for reacting to their abuse, yet somehow I’m still convinced i must be at least a covert narcissist. It’s tearing me up so much that I don’t know what else to do and just spend all day shaking and crying and in bed worrying that i’m a bad person. thank you for listening, any and all insight or advice will be appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/18arhue/im_afraid_im_a_narcissist_and_its_ruining_my_life/,t2_nijwsth8,2023-12-05 03:06:06,1
Birthday ko din,"To preface, birthday ko today. [24F]

Last night, my parents asked me what I want for my bday celebration. Haven't thought much about my bday nung papalapit na kasi di ko feel magcelebrate sa dami ng iniisip ko, but last night I was open to the idea ng handa dahil pinush din ako primarily ng mama ko.

Ayoko na kasi ng gastos, at most probably ako ang magluluto (gusto ko naman magluto, I love cooking for my family) but hindi ko lang talaga feel yung idea of celebrating my bday, ang gastos din kasi. My partner also said na magcelebrate nalang daw kami sa dinner na kaming dalawa, treat nya.

So we were talking and I was starting to get excited about it, naisip ko na gusto ko kainin ganyan kaya lang my mom kept saying ""Birthday ko din"" kasi daw she's the one who gave birth to me. At first tinatry ko ibrush off, until nagsusuggest na sya ng mga gusto NYA.

Brinush off ko initially hanggang sa tuloy tuloy sya sa pag suggest ng gusto nya, even invalidating yung gusto ko mangyari.

Sabi ko parang gusto ko ng something shrimp pasta, sabi nya 'hindi ba tayo magkakaallergy nyan?' As if walang shrimp sa gusto nyang food.  Even following up na kaya daw ganon sya sa shrimp dahil allergic daw yung partner ko sa shrimp (?) Which I find distasteful kasi halatang naghahanap nalang sya reason to save face. Also: WALANG MAY ALLERGY SA AMIN NG SHRIMP

Ngayon lang, nabring up na naman yung usapan so I got upset and told them to just do whatever they want. I feel like an asshole for reacting how I reacted. Pero nakakainis at nakakatampo, why bother asking me what I want kung gusto nya sya masunod?

I understand she's getting old but damn it's so draining. I want to claim emotional abuse at guilt tripping pero hay ewan.

Siguro nga para sa kanila na lang to, pero what's the point of asking me what I want diba? Ganto din sinabi ko last time, na aalis din naman ako sa dinner kaya kung gusto nila magluto at kung ano nalang gusto nilang kainin, go na lang. It seems pretty childish but if you know my mom and how she speaks kapag nagiinsinuate sya ng gusto nyang mangyari ewan ko na lang.

Added context: weeks before my bday (wc is actually roughly 2 weeks after her's) sabi ko ayoko na maghanda at magpamigay ng pagkain sa kapitbahay gaya ng ginagawa nila. Sabi nya sakin 'Pano naman kami dito? Kung ayaw mo magcelebrate pano kami dito?'",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1aks1tm/birthday_ko_din/,t2_2qyr693q,2024-02-07 10:27:03,1
Internet provider,"Hanggang ngayon mejo naluluha pa rin ako. I am 25 F
So eto na nga, Wala kaming net for 3 days na and Iam working from home. So kahapon pinuntahan ko yung internet provider dito sa area namin to ask what's going on and to askk kung dededuct ba yung araw na wala kaming net kasi nagloload ako. Nung turn ko na sa customer service, I asked nicely sa customer service rep kung ano gagawin kasi nga mejo mabigat yung binabayad ko sa load para sa work ko everyday. So si Kuya baka pagod na den anc stressed out kasi christmas party nila kahapon mejo tumaas na yung boses sakin, I heard it like a roaring sound na I guess he is in his late 30's and 6ft tall. Di ko namalayan tears started to flow in my eyes and everyone was staring at us na.Na tulala ako, then there's this feeling na naawa ako sa sariliko. Just to let you know I was physically and emotionally abused by my mom nung bata ako and meron akong PWD ID because of some mental issues that I am experiencing. 

sabi nya pa 
"" ay maam, may connection man o wala babayaran nyo pa rin yan. ganun talaga, kung walang 7 days na may outage sa area di namin i hohonor yan"" 

Earlier today may unknown number na tumawag, sinagot ko and narinig ko yung nakakatakot na boses. I started to cry again. Ewan. Na trauma siguro ako. OA no.

My best friend is still in love with her abusive ex and I don't know what to do anymore,"***tl;dr***: My friend still loves her abusive ex even though she's already in a loving, committed relationship and I don't know how to help her. It's frustrating to constantly give advice to someone who doesn't recognize that they were a victim of abuse and refuses to get help for it.

Alam niyo yung feeling pag kayo yung go-to ng friend/s mo for advice, tipong kahit single ka sayo pumupunta for relationship advice? 😂 I have no issues with this, often I'm single by choice; pwedeng dahil nakipag-break with someone who was being controlling, or stopped seeing someone whom I knew I wasn't going to ""love"".

Basically, they come to me kasi ako daw yung ""strong"" samin, ako yung alam kung pano titigil pag awat na (so ako yung tatandang dalaga hahaha).

So I have a best friend whom I love so much, but puta ang tanga tanga niya sa pag-ibig?

I've been best friends with this girl since high school. I've supported her with every relationship she had while we were growing up.

Then in college, she got into a relationship where she was the mistress — she found out months into the relationship na engaged pala si guy with a long-term gf; the guy insisted na si best friend yung mahal niya and they were engaged because of their families, but he was going to break it off once gumraduate sila ng college (spoiler alert: he did not).

Eventually, she met this new guy (around 5 years older than us — successful, tall, dark and handsome, family guy, prince charming kumbaga) and it seemed like he was perfect. And she was able to move on with his help. She saw him as her knight in shining armor.

Out of the frying pan... and into the fire.

**TRIGGER WARNING**: Emotional and physical abuse below. (I could go into so much detail about this guy and his abusiveness, but I'm not sure about sharing it since it's not really my story to tell, so snippet lang for now.)

The guy became abusive. Emotionally at first, then eventually physically. The guy worked abroad so di ito immediately naging obvious. It came to light when he had to stay in the country for several months; he stayed with her and the abuse got worse and physical, and the emotional abuse did not stop even pag-alis niya. He cheated on her on-and-off (the magic of social media is no side-chicks ever stays secret for long). He would pick fights then gaslight her. He would control her day and chastise her like a kid until she begs and answers the way he wants her to. Eventually, he forced her to cut us (most of her non-classmate friends) off. We only got in touch with her again and found out where he moved her nung nakapag-abroad na si guy and she had to reach out to us through her dad's account, and later a dummy account.

Whenever she came close to snapping enough to break up with him, he would beg for her back.

And she forgave him constantly. They lasted 5+ years. Pucha.

Believe me, we called the guy out. We tried to talk some sense into her. Kaso sabi ko nga, she was so *~~tanga~~* head over heels for this guy. When I found out about him hitting her, I wanted to report it so bad, to tell someone. Tell her dad at least. She begged me not to, insisting na minor lang naman pananakit niya.

Sadly, when we eventually told her dad (so that he would stop convincing her to take him back nung nanunuyo ulit siya)... medyo traditonalist dad niya and didn't see the fault in it much, just said he was disappointed *but* that the guy had done 'so much' for her — hoping this helps you see how good this guy is at playing people; he looks so nice and charming to people on the outside, and ang tendency is siya yung kakampihan and si girl yung sinisisi pag nag-aaway sila).

When they did eventually break up, nagpakasasa as single dude etong si guy and jumped from girl to girl. Eventually though, the guy asked for her back, saying he was going to change (*eye roll*). This has happened before and lagi siyang bumibigay. Luckily, she met this guy at work that seemed really decent and had all the qualities she was looking for in a man. Jackpot, di ba? Well...

I guess when she started saying No, he saw it as a challenge and worked harder to get her back. He actually returned to the Philippines for a while to woo her. And she was starting to fall for it again. Syempre, damage control kami ng friends niya. These two guys seemed to be one-upping each other for her attention, and god fucking damn it abusive ex was winning because of all their memories. The only reason she ended up not choosing her ex was because we found out that he had a ""backup girl"". She tried to defend him and said ""panakip butas"" lang yung isang girl, but we let her see otherwise.

This was around 5 years ago. She's now engaged to her (former) officemate, she's super close to his family, we know him well and he seems genuinely good (for a while, she was sort of the emotionally abusive one, parang yung mga ginawa sa kanya ng ex niya na pagiging controlling, nababalik niya kay new bf, who would call or go to us crying sometimes; we called her out on this and this eventually stopped).

We haven't seen each other in a while since the pandemic started, and when we finally did last weekend... she confessed that she was still stalking her ex. She says she thinks and dreams about him often. She's haunted by ""what-ifs"" and flat out said that if her ex were to woo her again, she's sure it would take little convincing for her to take him back.

Naiiyak ako. I love my friend, ***pero puta bakit ang tanga tanga niya***?

I told her that she was a victim of abuse. He made her so dependent on him at one point na until now, parang hinahanap hanap niya pa din siya. She still hasn't recovered and looks like she'll need help, kasi our words aren't helping. Paulit ulit lang kami. She refuses to believe this (and I get that people who are abused don't recognize it sadly; it's been so long though so akala ko goods na siya). She just says na ""Minahal ko eh"" and that he helped her so much and they'd been through so much together.

Our mutual friend informed me na pauwi si guy next month. And I'm nervous as fuck.

Advice welcome. Baka may alam kayong therapist na pwedeng tumulong dito, yung chill lang kausap para pumayag na siya finally mag-therapy.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/ui0may/my_best_friend_is_still_in_love_with_her_abusive/,t2_gnyimaue,2022-05-04 14:52:01,1
as a tired friend na akisma,"pagod na me maging available sa friend kong tumatawag or mag chachat lang pag nag away ng jowa nyang abuser. she has a history of depression and she said parang it's coming back dahil dito sa jowa nya na di nya kaya hiwalayan kahit ginagawa na syang punching bag physically and emotionally. she'll call when im working kahit tambak na ako ng workload kakausapin ko muna sya ending mapapa OT ako pag ok na sya she will not reply to my messages asking if how's she doing na. 

this morning while im asleep, nag chat sya and pet peeve ko talaga ang mga nag chachat ng walang context or tatawagin ka muna sa chat.  pagod na pagod ako sa work this week dahil 3 nag resign sa amin so bigat ng workload isang week 2-4 hrs OT. so tulog pa ako mga teh nagising ako ng freaking 5AM dahil sa tawag nya pag sagot ko umiiyak na naman ang gaga. this time, nag sorry ako dahil gusto kong magpahinga dahil ako pagod na pagod na rin ako sa life and wala naman akong mapagsasabihan so di ko na kaya pa mag accommodate pa ng problema ng iba.

most of my friends are like that. ako pa mag aaya sa mga tropa ko pag may isa kaming friend na sad but pag ako nag aaya sa kanila na di ko sasabihin na ""kasi malungkot si ganito"" no one's available. very relate ako sa certain lyrics talaga nung song na Maps na ""I was there for you in your darkest times
I was there for you in your darkest night. But I wonder, where were you? When I was at my worst down on my knees. And you said you had my back. So I wonder, where were you?""

edited: i'm not the type of friend na masalita or know how to comfort through words dahil di ako ung sweet type of friend. what i do is sasamahan ko lang friends ko kumbaga i express it through action not words. maybe, ako takbuhan nila because i'm a funny girl na madaldal pag magkakasama kami kahit anong group of friends pa yan i am the funny one. the joker of the group. but when it comes sa pag hingi ng advise or comforting words, di ko kaya yun.

Normalize asking nga muna if okay lang mag dump ng kashitan ng buhay,"Putangina. Putangina lang talaga sagad. 

Sorry pero tanginang hindi ko magawang maging mabuti munang tao at bigyan ka ng simpatya dahil sa mga kaputanginahang nangyari sayo sa buhay. 

Putangina for dumping your rants sa life, stories of the abuses, rape, and how shitty your life is. 

Wala akong enough mental capacity to take those shits rn, pero to dump it all on me. Isahan. Tuloy-tuloy. Walang preno. Biglaan. 

Putangina pero mukha ba akong mentally and emotionally okay and ready?!

I KNOW THEY ARE ALL SERIOUS MATTERS. 

PERO FUCK. 

Sana ugaliin muna to ask permission if okay lang ba yung taong makakareceive no'n. 

Now, I am crying hard kasi hindi ko kinakaya yung bigat na naipasa sa akin just from reading your chats and kwento. 

Now, nanginginig ako and mentally and emotionally drained kasi hindi ko kaya yung mga kwento mo. 

Tangina talaga kasi yung pagiging oversharer mo walang kinikilalang boundaries ng ibang tao. 

I am emotionally and mentally triggered ngayon and hindi ako makafunction kahit na ang dami ko pa need gawin. 

Putangina talaga. Di ko alam kung gumaan pakiramdam mo or what, pero tangina kasi ako naman nagsusuffer ngayon. 

Pare-pareho lang naman tayo pinuputangina ng buhay. 

Hindi mo kailangan doblehin yung sa iba.

Hindi lahat okay na makareceive ng rants and serious problems ng iba. Hindi lahat mentally and emotionally ready and okay to become a listener and receiver. 

Tangina. I feel paralyzed. I feel drained. I feel triggered.

What being a victim of SA at a young age REALLY looks like,"Throaway account for obvious reasons. Maybe I want to be judged, but I'm going to confess things I can never even say out loud alone. A year ago, nagspeak up ako about this particular experience sa close friends ko sa IG. A lot of people called me ""brave"" and ""strong, but if they only knew what went behind the scenes I know they would look at me in a different way. I won't go into detail about the assault years ago, but basically I was the product of a teenage pregnancy--my parents then had to work their ass off para makakita ng pera so we had to stay at this extra small room na nirerentahan nila from a family friend. Said family friend na sobrang tanda na, literally with college children already, groomed me back then everyday paggaling sa school to sit on his lap para payagan niya raw akong kumuha ng kahit ilang candy sa tindahan nila, while he put his hands where it shouldn't whilst I was still wearing my preschool uniform. I was only 4 years old and was starved back then. He took advantage of that.  May kasambahay din kami that time (who also beat me to shreds) na suspected kabit nya kaya pinagkakatiwalaan akong ipaalaga sakanya everytime wala parents ko. 

Fast forward to when I was 6 years old and medyo nakapagipon ipon na sila papa, we finally had our own place. In those 2 years, I already knew something was wrong with what that man did to me but I wasn't wise enough as a child to interpret and cope with that in a healthy way. Instead, I turned out to be really hypersexual. I just recently realized how fucked up everything was back then. For instance, I would comfort myself with sexual thoughts involving older men whenever my parents would beat me or when I cannot go to sleep. I also developed some kind of an Oedipus Complex where I was sexually attracted with my father. I discovered orgasm whilst rubbing his used underwear down there. Even with my relatives na basta older men pagiisipan ko nang kung anu-ano behind the doors. I would also deliberately dress in skimpy clothes and even wore a sanitary napkin when I haven't even had my period yet just to feel like a woman. 

Eventually, I became sexually active at the age of 13. I developed really early and was admittedly attractive, even as a teenager. I liked the attention even sa mga tambay sa kanto, I would fucking get turned on from it like a sick fuck. I lost my virginity with a man who I met sa omegle who KNEW i was 13, while skipping a class. It was a fetish then to get fucked while wearing a uniform.  I've stopped hating myself for my decisions back then, but looking back, I just wish someone could've saw right through me and what was really going on. I excelled academically but had an attitude problem. I had to be kicked out for bullying hanggang sa palipat lipat ako ng school and slowly got addicted to alcohol. Nalayo na rin loob ko sa parents ko as they were also physically and emotionally abusive + pent up anger for neglecting when I was younger. 

Of course, all of this manifested to toxic relationships with borderline unhinged sex. I knew I was more genuinely attracted with women and felt more emotional connection but for some reason I only pursued relationships with men. It came to the point na nagiging abusive na ako sa boyfriend ko that time, I wanted him to be really rough to the point na gusto ko talagang magpass out, and not even for sexual pleasure alone. I wanted him to feel really bad and got off from the emotional abuse it caused. Once, I made him do something I would never forgive myself for, I made him do self harm after I forced him to cut me and fucking masturbated to it.

I was going insane but no one suspected a thing. My fuckups were considered just a phase I was going through hanggang nasanay nalang sila. It backfired syempre nyng nakita ni mama conversations namin . It was messy as hell and I was constantly being reminded of what I did, mom ko pa mismo nagchismis hanggang sa relatives ko. I was already contemplating death by suicide.Humingi ako help from my relatives to refer me to a Psychiatrist. I was then diagnosed with Bipolar 1 w/psychosis and was deemed clinically depressed. I tried na kausapin ulit mom ko and finally admit what happened 14 years ago as I slowly got better but I should've learned my lesson firsthand to not trust my mom. I was called a liar, of course, it's been 14 years bakit ngayon ko lang sasabihin? She told me I was using it as an excuse sa kababuyan ko raw. I made her words my gospel back then as I was filled with so much shame, I had to stop school temporarily and ghosted everyone, which eventually led to losing my already flimsy friendships. 

Nung nag 18 na ako saka ako nagdecide to speak up sa close friends ko lang sa IG about what really happened and confronted the pedophile from 14 years ago. I waited till I turned an adult para lahat ng decision ko onwards would solely be blamed unto me. Of course the bastard denied my statements. Of fucking course the bastard contacted my mother but I couldn't care less anymore. Sabi niya nakakahiya, immoral at walang utang na loob, wala naman daw akong laban kung gusto ko mangdemanda at hindi niya ako kakampihan. Ni hindi ko naman gusto umabot sa demandahan, I really just wanted closure. I got some support from friends pero I neglected all of it again and shut off from the world. 

Ngayon wala, I just feel really empty. I've abstained from my previous actions pero there are still times na those disgusting thoughts would devour me and I couldn't stop it, I feel like I would never feel genuine love as I do not have the capability to do so myself. My whole personality changed and I'm not sure I'm liking it but at least it was less of a mess than before. Everyone in my life right now are basically new set of people and all they really know about me is that I'm someone reliable and kind. God, if they only knew. Sorry for the really long post, dunno if anyone would even bother to read all this but at least I got if off my chest, for now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/186ugp9/what_being_a_victim_of_sa_at_a_young_age_really/,t2_owvbp7t4b,2023-11-30 01:08:52,8

ive only been recently realizing how severely depressed i actually am and it scares me how good i am at hiding it from everyone including myself,"tw depression

everyone knows me as cheerful and goofy and silly. people straightup tell me they admire how light and positive i am, meanwhile i often feel so sad that im suffocating and i hold back tears while eating dinner because i feel like crying for no reason.  
  
i have a job as a wfh software engineer and it's overwhelming to me but upon reading stories online and from what my coworkers tell me it's normal to be overwhelmed, unfortunately i mercilessly emotionally abuse myself over it though i am trying to change that  
  
what's so difficult about being depressed is that i already know what i must do, i've learned a lot from podcasts held by therapists and so many things they teach make sense to me and click for me to the point i cry, but the thing is i have so little energy and focus it's hard to apply their teachings. and it makes me more frustrated knowing what to do, simple things really like thanking yourself for the things you do, meditating for 40 seconds or however long i can, but still struggling to do them. and then i start hating myself more for struggling to do them.  
  
my default mood is sad. i am practicing self awareness and mindfulness and the realizations crush me. i am just sad all the time. but smiling is so easy and it doesn't even register as faking it, i'm probably not faking it thou. what i feel is, when i laugh and smile with others i am actually happy, but the sadness underneath doesn't go away, it's like i'm happy and sad at the same time. and as soon as the happy moment is over it's an immediate snap back to pure sadness.

ang saya makahinga ng maluwag,"possible TW

lumipat kami rito sa bahay ng tita ko kasi sobrang abusive ng tatay ko. nananakit siya physically and emotionally, sobrang libog din niya. naninilip siya kapag maliligo ako o kapag iihi ako tapos he would act like it was ""accudental"", napansin din pala ng kapatid ko 'yun kaya he helped me change curtains doon sa CR ng bahay ng tatay ko. nung una akala ko nasa isip ko lang 'yun and accidentally lang talaga. pero nagpipigil na ako ng ihi ko madalas nung nandun pa kami and I don't take showers regularly na rin dahil natatakot na ako na masilipan uli. kahit 'yung skin care ko hindi ko na rin magawa kasi natatakot ako na baka mag-attempt na naman siyang hipuan ako. 

ngayong nandito na ako sa bahay ng tita ko, I take showers regularly na and I started to do my skin care na uli. bumalik na rin appetite ko. hindi ko na kailangan mag-earphones uli para magpatugtog ng malakas kapag nag-aaway sila mama. hindi ko na kailangan pilitin sarili ko na matulog kapag lasing na naman tatay ko para lang hindi ako ma-trigger. wala na rin akong suicidal ideation since we moved out saka nakaka-feel na ako ng emotions ngayon kahit konti, hindi na rin ako numb physically.

I feel emotionally detached from my mum,I don't feel like I love my mum anymore or I feel detached from her. I don't feel any warmth towards her. I don't come for her for emotional support. I don't want to hug her or talk to her that much. And when I look at her I don't think of her as my mother but as someone who clamis to be. She is not abusive. Well at least not anymore. But I can say that she did a shitty job rasing me up. But right now I can't shake off the feeling that I don't love my mum anymore.,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/17omg2t/i_feel_emotionally_detached_from_my_mum/,t2_fsujrqngq,2023-11-06 05:38:44,2
Attachment issues,"Little background first, I am a survivor of SA. Strongly believed that I have been emotionally abused by immediate family members. It took me almost 9 years to recover and mature properly since I had to step up in my family as the adult. Not to mention, just got out of a emotionally and toxic relationship just last year. My partner was a complete nightmare. Not only he invalidates my SA experience but started to control on how I dress, friends and family members (he was telling me that he was jealous of my immediate family members because of our closeness?)Based on my past experiences and family background, I would say it’s understandable that I start to develop unhealthy habits such as Attachment Issues.

There’s this guy I’ve been following, I think he’s brave for surviving every thing that happened to him. Not to mention his views based on politics. I’ve always wanted to talk to him but I have trouble coming neat male figures and we both had indirect past issues due to his friends. Right now, when I checked his twt I was surprised to see he was dating. Good for him! I’m genuinely happy and relief, he found someone to be his haven; his safe space. Nothing brings me more joy than to see people finding partners in this world. Especially, it can be a rough ride. But I can’t help but feel a little bit sad. Maybe I had a little crush? I don’t know. I don’t have a strong definition and image of love because of my parents.

My mom went home as a surprise from abroad and I feel weird,"For short, Im 20F and my mom used to abuse me emotionally and she hit me physically (last year) and di kami close. Malayo na loob ko sa kanya kasi growing up, di kami masyado nagsasama.

So eto, may sumabing “Tao po” sa labas ng bahay namin eh 11pm na. Kami ng ate ko kumain at nag chismis , pero nung may narinig kaming tao bigla kaming tumahimik. Kala kasi namin, baka taong namamasko lang eh wag na lang pansinin.

Putcha 30 sec after eh di siya huminto ng “tao po” . Sabi ko sa ate ko “Parang kaboses ni mama noh?” 

Chineck ni ate at yun, nabigla siya at siya nga talaga. Si mama. Nag surprise welcome home.


Idk what to feel, masaya ako pero at the same time nainis at nabigla. Bago pa naman kami nag usap ni mama few days ago na hindi pa ako handa na uuwi siya this April. Sabi niya naiintindihan niya at aware siya.

Extremely tired,"//tw ahead ig, suicide and abuse

Siguro mentally deranged lang ako (18), or sobrang iba interpretation ko sa buhay. I've been verbally and physically abused, lately pag napapagalitan ako I get this inch of fear sa family ko even I'm used and doesn't really care. I'm on my own, mostly on my own since I'm not supported on anything anymore, walang pake sa gustong passion na laging mino-mock, every movement or action seen as stupid or wrong. When I wanted to work to finally become independent and leave this shithole family, my uncle kept pushing me to stop because ""wala kang pupuntahan, hindi ka aasenso sa buhay."" Yes, abusive yung household ko, my mother (trans, once male now female) saw hurting as a way of discipline dahil ganun din sila dinisiplina. My cousin let her (or his, idfc and I disrespect trans-people. HOT TAKE but they're very angry all of their life to someone) anger out on me by hurting me, and family members feel happy about it. Another cousin loved mocking me, making me emotionally and mentally silent losing the passion I love when they're around (her family living in when my grandmother died).

Earlier, I just had some nonsensical thought I told to my bestfriend: ""hurting someone as a minor isn't abuse but discipline, hurting someone as an adult is abuse or violence."" I know I had my wrongs, but as a younger teen years back it's taking all over me knowing and scared na baka maging stuck buhay ko sa kamay ng nanay ko na sobrang strict, which I disrespected so badly dahil di ko nagustuhan yung way of discipline niya. Growing up religiously and graduating from the same catholic school I used to study in, I'm starting to lose my shit that ""maganda school mo, tinuturuan ka ng maganda bakit hindi ka ganyan,"" doesn't reflect to the abuse she's done.

Wanted to commit suicide back then, aunt ko naman was happy seeing the cuts on my arms telling me na ""sige mamatay ka na ayan naman gusto mo."" Never ko siyang mapapatawad, and wala akong pake sa uncle ko na laging sinasabi na ""pamilya lang kaya mong takbuhan."" Kahit na na-experience na lahat ng uncle ko, never kong babalikan pamilya ko knowing na mentally and emotionally I was abused. Knowing my friends helped me more to recover, kahit never ako pinapatuloy sa bahay nila dahil ayaw ng magulang, they did a better job talking to me more than being berated by my uncle na imbes na kausapin ako. And FUCK. HIS. SMUG. SMILE. for every sentence, sobrang mocking.

Please, gusto ko na lumayas sa bahay na to, I'm tired na tiisin yung bullshit control nila, kung pwede lang sana sa ibang pamilya nalang ako inadopt na di tinago yung katotohanan at mas tinuring akong pamilya kesa maging retirement plan na big bragging machine sa ibang family members.

Ang sakit na magwalk out sa isang toxic relationship,"Alam mo ung love mo ung person pero alam mo sa self mo na pag nafall ka ulit sa “promises” nq magbabago siya, uulit nanaman ung cycle ng emotional and verbal (sometimes physical) abuse. I decided not to accept ung pakikipagbalikan nya kasi sobra na kong nasaktan at napagod sa lahat ng effort ko na di naman nya naappreciate. Parang kahit anong gawin ko, mali, nakakainis, hindi enough. Ang sakit marinig

 Anyways di lang kasi ako makatulog kasi baka part of me nagguilty na kahit nageeffort naman sya recently eh ayaw ko parin. Kaso sa time na tintry nya ayusin nag away nanaman kami (take note di pa kami okay) so ano na????

Sobrang totoo pala ung phrase na “sometimes love is not enough” kasi kahit gano mo kamahal ung tao, mapupuno at mapupuno ka rin talaga. Siguro fault ko na rin kasi binottle ko lang pero everytime nagaaway kami before, lagi ko naman cinocommunicate ung frustrations ko pero it always fell on deaf ears.

Anyways sa mga katulad ko na kakaalis lang sa isang magulong relationship. I hope makahanap na tayong Peace pati narin sa partners natin. Sana magkapeace of mind na tayong lahat.

I finally got the courage to seek professional help!!!,"After a year of trying, yes!!!! Finally!!! I was able to seek professional help na dahil afford ko na kahit papaano. When I was at my lowest, after my ex financially abused me, I was left with nothing. I had no adult to lean on. 

Parents were too busy and apparently mental health isn't that much of a ""thing"" to my boomer parents.

As panganay, naiintindihan ko naman yun at growing up, I'm just used to getting up on my own. May sakit? Bili ng gamot, magpagaling. Kung may kailangan ako at may gusto ko, I should know how to get it myself. I didnt get the assistance my sisters are getting rn--- and thats okay. Ako naman na nag bibigay nung mga hinahanap hanap ko sa parents ko sa mga sisters ko.

So biggest life set back ko talaga last year after my ex abused me mentally, emotionally, physically and mostly: FINANCIALLY. Lahat ng harm binigay sakin nun and up until now, I'm suffering.

So big step talaga saakin na nakapag seek na ako ng help. I was prescribed medicines to help me cope up.

I have depression, PTSD and *i forgot the other one*

Dapat hindi na lang kita ulit tinanggap,"So ayon andito na naman ako baka naalalaa nyo ko ako yung nagpost ng pinalayas ko yung jowa ko kase ayaw magsorry pagtapos akong sigawan. 

Lahat kayo nag advice na wag ko nang balikan and honestly, determined ako sa first 4 days pero on the 5th day, ayon marupok pa din. Bumalik sya sabi magbabago na. “I will be a better man for you lovey” “Hindi ko kaya mabuhay ng wala ka” “Hindi ako masaya kapag wala ka”

Ang hinihingi ko lang is pag usapan lahat ng problema namen. Ugali nya kasing layasan ako kapag may problema. Tapos babalik kapag tingin nya humupa na yung galit ko then mag aact as if walang nangyari. Sasabihin nya lang “sorry” tapos for him, ayun na yung usap na kailangan ko.

Nung bumalik sya sabi nya willing na daw sya magpa couples counseling, mag open up at mapag usapan lahat ng problema. Naghintay ako ng 2 weeks para mag approach sya, wala. Ako na yung nag approach on Thursday pero tumatahimik lang sya sabi nya nag iisip daw sya hanggang sa makatulog na lang ako tapos wala naman pag uusap na nangyari.

Friday kinausap ko na bandang hapon kasi hindi ko na kaya dalhin yung 2 years worth ng problema namin dalawa na mag isa lang ako. So pinilit ko nang mag usap kame. As expected, nag hakot na naman ng gamit at nag amba na aalis. Pinigilan ko, pinagsasampal at sapak ko na sa sobrang gigil ko. Kumalma onti at sige mag uusap na daw. Unang tanong nya, “ano ba kasing problema?” lahat ng problema nilista ko sa kanya bago sya bumalik dito 2 weeks ago so nakaka bobo that question.

I was working din so paputol putol yung usapan. Pero he ended up promising na mag aapproach na sya, makikipag usap at hindi na lalayas kapag masama loob ko. Hindi pa kami nakakapag settle ng usapan nito but at least umasa ako na magkaka progress na.

Umabot ng 12am natapos na ko mag work. 12-3am nakahiga lang kame pareho sya sa sahig ako sa kama, wala syang approach. 3am sasabog na puso ko so I went for a walk. Nagtext sya “matulog na tayo” like pota wala pa din pag uusap na mangyayare? Ang ending, dinikdik ko na naman ipaintindi sa kanya yung problemang hindi nya pakikipag usap. At dahil don, lumayas na naman sya. The Saga continues. 

Di ko na alam gagawin ko pero Peter kung hindi mo kayang ayusin yung pakikipag relasyon mo saken please wag ka na lang bumalik kasi nasisira buhay ko sayo. Kasalanan ko din kasi tinatanggap kita pero hindi ko na kaya lahat ng emotional abuse na nakukuha ko sayo.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/18jj2n6/dapat_hindi_na_lang_kita_ulit_tinanggap/,t2_d1thlpgr,2023-12-16 12:24:55,2
Secret Slaves,"TW: Mention of sexual abuse. Long post ahead.

Last night, my girlfriend asked if we could watch Jessica Soho's new documentary episode, Secret Slaves. She informed me naman beforehand about the premise of the docu. The docu revolves around human trafficking.

While watching one specific part of the docu where the pimp was trying to bargain with a foreigner about an oblivious child beside her, I felt a familiar feeling of anger and anguish. The same feelings that I only feel whenever *I am on the opposite side of the couch.*

For context, I am a child psychologist specializing abused kids. Victims, child perpetrators... everything about kids' behavioral, emotional and psychological issues actually. My job gave me the opportunity to see the different and creative angles of kids' colorful povs. I handle adult patients too but I enjoyed handling and kids because they are easier to deal with. Kids are smart and direct. Even way direct than adults could ever be. Gusto, gusto; ayaw, ayaw. They have difficulty expressing their thoughts into words but with the right questions, you will be able to draw out meaningful answers and povs from them. Most of time, even better than how adult perceive things about life.

I have seen, heard and analyzed how victims and even kids who are already perpetrators at a young age think and behave. I have heard how things run in their precious heads. While watching a specific scene sa docu, I felt the eerie and familiar feeling of frustration. That feeling of my heart breaking into pieces while feeling so enraged to the point that I want to smash abusers' face so bad.

My breaths started to feel heavier. Ilang beses akong tinanong ng girlfriend ko if kaya ko pa ba. She told me a lot of times that we could stop. I lost count how many times I uttered different curses under my breath. I kept reassuring her na kaya ko. Kinaya ko naman talaga. I just felt so damn mad about the realities of abuse and the trauma it would bring to kids.

Mahirap magtherapy ng victims. Many times I had to control myself from punching something whenever a patient would nonchalantly narrate how she was abused during play therapies. Para sakanila, nagkkwento lang sila while playing with toys pero yung kwento nila brings you into their hellish nightmare. The stories of how they were abused are so damn agonizing. Not knowing what kind of life they would live in the future is what always... always kills me every damn time. 

Sessions with child perpetrators are different stories tho. You get to see a glimpse of how rapists are bred. Mas mabigat; mas nakakagalit. They were victims themselves. But instead of caring for them, they were groomed to become monsters. Damn it!

Natapos naman namin yung docu. My girlfriend apologized to me profusely because she knew it triggered me. But I'm fine. I can handle myself. Iba lang din talaga when you're *on the opposite side of the couch.*",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/16hrd4u/secret_slaves/,t2_e5fnnay0,2023-09-14 00:19:31,22
“You should thank God you still have both your parents” - my mom.,"Hi. Sorry I’m new here and have no where to vent. I have anxiety and PTSD so I may thinking may not be straight… just wanted to ask if gaslighting ba tong ganito? 

For context, my mom and I fought kasi she wouldn’t admit she was wrong over something I was helping her with (legal documents and procedures) and imbis na she’ll just apologize, she’s giving me the silent treatment. 

And then just a few hours ago she said me a photo with a quote na “You should thank God you still have both your parents” out of the blue. I am crying and had an anxiety attack after I read it and it honestly hurt so much. Kaya ayaw ko magka kids kasi I came from an emotionally abusive family, and I would never intentionally make my kids feel like they owe me something, and I’m still trying to heal over the loads mental stress my parents give me all the time. 

Just wanted to rant kasi wala akong ibang people to talk about this and maybe get some other perspective of my situation (like is this normal? How do I respond?) tysm.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/11zkzt8/you_should_thank_god_you_still_have_both_your/,t2_wokch,2023-03-23 21:48:56,3
Tired of being the middle child,"Hello I just want to rant somewhere since matagal ko na siya kinkimkim sa sarili ko haha. 

So I grew up sa family na considered as a mid class type of family and I was the middle child. Ever since I was young I was labeled as the black sheep and parang anything I do is considered wrong or pang tanga. So, I recently graduate with a degree of BSBA majoring in financial management this july and even before graduation naghanap na ako ng work but not all of them are up to my standard or di ako na consider since I was still graduating.

So almost 2 months na akong Unemployed, well technically hindi kasi natangap na ako sa isang BPO company, and yes I chose a BPO company sa pasahod nila and benefits. So ayun nga I am considered to be unemployed since start ng work ko end of September pa and all I heard is my parents complaining na nagpapasarap lang daw ako and wala na daw ako ginawa and I was like di ba ako pwede magpahinga for a short while haha.

My parents are the type na you will be mentally and emotionally exhausted kasi despite na mid class kami, lumaki silang mahirap and they consider us taking a break or gumastos for ourself is considered to be makasarili and katamaran. They say na where not a retirement plan but they want us to provide at least 15k once na nag work na kami, hence why I chose a BPO company kasi pag corporate ako sobrang baba ng sahod I was even offered 12k lang since fresh grad daw ako. I understand that they worked hard to give us the life na di kami nagugutom at naka graduate kami, pero it's so tiring na susumbat nila palagi lahat lahat ng ginawa nila. 

I grew up sa family na mentally, physically, and emotionally abusive. Mental health is not something considered sa bahay and bawal ka mapagod or maging mahina mentally sa bahay namin and it's hard being a sensitive person having to act na malakas ako when in reality gusto ko na sumuko. Yes, sumasagot ako sa parents ko only when I know their wrong pero they will push what they know na tama. I love my parents pero nakakapagod na talaga pero I can't even leave the house dahil need ko mag bigay.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/16d6yte/tired_of_being_the_middle_child/,t2_ja3jls1lt,2023-09-08 18:33:45,1
dealing with an abusive brother and a dismissive adult family,"just a throwaway account. i've just been frustrated to no end.

i have a brother above a decade older than me who grew up with an abusive father. because of this he ended up growing with immense trauma and anger issues. i'm his younger half sibling from another father.

when i was younger i always knew he had issues, but back then it was mostly just being unable to control when he yells etc etc. usually my mom would tell him to calm down and that used to be enough. pero when he grew older he started becoming straight up abusive, not just to his gf and stepkids, but also to some other people he'd live with, like their live in yaya.

i've been lucky enough not to be the target of his physical and emotional abuse, mainly protected by my mom. (he told me tho i was lucky he never hit me. thaaaanks.)

anyway, he doesn't live with us but often comes back home for family stuff like new years etc. it's usually then where i'd just see him fight with his gf and straight up hit her at times. i remember when i was a kid he held a fork up to her face right in front of me while they fought.

what's most frustrating about this whole situation tbh is how the adults in my family handle it. us kids (me, mga pinsan ko) know what he's doing is very, very wrong, but we're very young compared to him and most of us are just starting college and have no financial or even personal freedom to start butting in. the adults like my mom, my titas, etc just think he has a ""personality."" for my titas case it's mainly bc di nila nakikita ung other side nya, kasi usually medj friendly and talkative sya pag masaya o kalmado.

i've dealt with this for years and even if i wasn't a victim myself, ofc i felt horrible knowing his gf and kids have to deal with him everyday. his gf is used to it even if she hates it kasi she believes it's normal since her parents had a similar relationship. i'm worried about their children perpetuating the cycle.

i got super fed up with it today and recorded one of their altercations so i'd just have some evidence, or at least proof to vent when people don't want to listen. he saw me recording and threatened me too. nothing came of it thankfully, but i was so frustrated that i was unable to do anything for my SIL who was crying and my nephew who was probably watching or listening in the other room.

i was already feeling terrible but what made it even worse was when i sent the video to my mom. she asked me a few things about what happened kasi di masyadong clear ung angle ng video, and after that i told her that i told some other relatives, which she got mad about. sinabi nya that i was tearing my brother's image and asked kung naghahanap lang ako ng away. she said that others would just be annoyed that i kept whistleblowing about personal family business.

i felt so disillusioned with my mom at that moment. is your image more important than the people he's hurting? nakakaiyak. i cried alone in my room later. why was i the only one getting mad at this type of situation? i know it's sort of part of the culture here, pero it doesn't mean it's right. 

i'm also scared to take action now as a dependent of my mom bc if anything fails and he finds out i was 
responsible, i might also be targetted. it's so frustrating. i wish things could change. i hope i can change it when i'm older. i want my pamangkins to grow up without this trauma.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/18pcfm0/dealing_with_an_abusive_brother_and_a_dismissive/,t2_cx24283q,2023-12-24 03:00:24,1

"After exposing my ex-GF cheating, my brain chemistry was altered.","After ko lumayas sa kanila, dahil sa panunumbat at pananakit nya(partida babae pa to) I had no choice pero lumayas na sa kanila.Binigyan ko pa siya ng 2k wayback oct pambayad sana kuryente pero ano ginawa niya? NAGPAREBOND! Big insecure girl indeed.

Here are the list that ive noticed.

&#x200B;

1. Takot nako lumabas, due to the threats i barely go outside(mag grocery lang). I don't even go to the church just for my safety.(Check myprevious post)
2. Im afraid to express myself without being called pavictim,sadboi, etc etc. Like cmon man. All i want is to be heard and not critisized. If there is something wrong with it. Make your point. Give some unsolicited advice. But sadly, not all human beings are smart enough instead divulging into marites mode. Its me vs her and her friends. Mga enabler na kunsintidor.
3. Saying thank you always para hindi ma labeled as ungrateful.
4. I flinch when someone shout or drag me in the shoulder. Sometimes I just go on silent like a kid crying(Maybe this is my defense mechanism). Mind you hindi lng emotional abuse ang nangyayari.
5. I noticed that Bad behavior is justifyable kasi may utang ang tao sayo . You can humiliate, degrade, someone in facebook kasi nagkautang siya sayo not to think his/her reputation. (Kung may utak ka edi ipabaranggay mo para may summon to settle the debt hindi ung petty, squammy sht sa FB)
6. Trust issues. Mga mutual friends natin mga marites rin.
7. Mas priority pala kaligayahan ng babae kesa sa wellbeing/mental health ng lalaki.
8. Relapse and anxiety na for almost 5 months.

&#x200B;

I know I need therapy but the fact na dinala nya ko sa bahay nila ng walang-wala and I can even barely find a secured job makes it difficult. I was left on destitute. Her aunt even mentioned na "" Siya nag dala ng lalake tas susumbatan nya lang as if hindi siya tumutulong sa gastusin nyo sa bahay"". Accountability is rarely seen in this generation. Kasalanan ko lang nagpaubaya ako sa kanya.

FINALLY,"

FINALLY

After all the emotional and verbal abused.. finally! An air i can breathe. Im happy that after 4 years I have the courage to move out from my tito and his wife’s roof. Yeah, I’m lucky enough to get that scholarship and live rent free away from my family to pursue my dreams but being treated like I’m not belong, a household helper, serving them and getting hit for I never met their expectations ay hindi tama. (For the record they have their own household helper as well)

I know my mom never fails to educate me about living other’s roof on what to do ‘cause that comes naturally if you have the initiative and kahihiyan. 

NEVER LIVE WITH EXTENDED FAMILY, RELATIVES IF YOU ARE PURSUING YOUR DREAMS AWAY FROM YOUR HOME.

for years, nanahimik ako, palaging pinapagalitan ni mama despite of the distance between us because of the never ending reports of my tito’s wife when I give them the slightest mistake.

Generation na hirap na mag-express ng negative emotions.,"Sa napapansin ko dito sa subreddit na ito na ang dami sa atin hirap mag-express ng negative emotions natin dahil ito ang nakasanayan natin since childhood at dahil ito ang tinuturo ng parents natin. If ever may sama tayo ng loob sa magulang or nakakatanda kahit valid ang reason ang tawag sayo ay bastos or ungrateful. Kung may discomfort ka man na vino-voice out mo sinasabihan kang 'emo, emotional, di nagdadasal, walang kaibigan, 'di ka kasi uminom', bading and other derogatory comments.

Sa sobrang nasanay tayo magkimkim ng emotions natin na hirap din tayong iprocess siya na prone na tayo sa pagiging self-destructive ng di natin alam. Toxic masculinity, pagiging overly resilient, pagiging overly positive thinker, excessive partying, excessive alcohol consumption, overworking, projections ng ating insecurities or standards natin papunta sa ibang tao sa social media, pagiging emotionally tone deaf, dishonesty sa romantic relationships, unhealthy hoe phase, self-harm, suicide, and the lists goes on.

Pero may times din na whenever nakakafeel ako na matinding galit sa parents ko dahil sa ganitong line of thinking, iniisip ko na lang na baka victims din sila nito. Di naman sa iniinvalidate ko paghihirap ng karamihan sa generation natin pero matindi kasi pinagdaanan din nila. Baka naging highly desensitized na rin kasi sila dahil sa hirap ng buhay nila dati, maling parental style ng mga lolo at lola natin, societal pressures, at di pagkakaroon ng freedom na iexpress ang sarili. Cycles of abuse? Kung ano ang naexperience ng abuser ganon din gagawin ng victim nila sa ibang tao unless natuto na siya na mali ang naexperience nila? 

Anyway sana lang man sa susunod na generation natuto na sila from our generation.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/x5l4t8/generation_na_hirap_na_magexpress_ng_negative/,t2_s3pn2a06,2022-09-04 19:52:13,15
Wasted Years of my life.,"Kakainis lng to realize na I just wasted a big chunk of my life because of fear and insecurities. I didnt enjoy much of my childhood and teenage yrs, now im 24 and with little improvement as a person. I wish went to parties,drink alcohoc,do weed,do wild stuff and have a solid na barkada, but i just wasted it because I was paranoid and naive. I wasted every oppurtunity nung ininvite ako ng mga college mates ko and never got into a relationship kc Im just not confident enough.
