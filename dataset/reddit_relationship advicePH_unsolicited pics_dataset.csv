Bf likes to get off using t*l*gram n*des and I didn't like it. He is telling me now that I am overreacting.,"I (22F) and my bf (23M) have been together for almost 5 years. I only discovered this recently and it never settled with me well. We had this conversation more than once already. Talagang I told him I find it uncomfy kasi n*des are more personalized than porn kaso reason nya is p*rn lng talaga yung perspective nya sa mga sa pics, no attachment, just a means of pleasure. Hindi ko rin alam if those pictures sent sa gc are unsolicited lol. Further down the argument, he starts telling me I shouldn't get insecure. But to me it's out of respect. And to him he is still respecting me even if he uses the pics as a means of getting off once in a blue moon.

My point is just if he sees it as a means of getting off why can't he stick to those kind of vids in the homemade genre and get defensive over the telegram gc when I ask him to stop looking at it or leave the gc lol. I want perspectives lng from other people para maiwasan na ako magoverthink na ako ba talaga na nagoover react ganun HAHAHAHA. How do I tell him without him having to feel annoyed over it? How do I convince him or talk to him?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/16jwp8b/bf_likes_to_get_off_using_tlgram_ndes_and_i_didnt/,t2_jrq6uq3vw,2023-09-16 11:05:19,27,30
What was the nicest way someone has told you your boyfriend was cheating on you?,"Hi guys! Weird question I  know, but I find myself in this exact situation where I \[F21\] found out my friend \[M21\] is trying to cheat on his GF \[F??\] with me. As in, asking to HU while they’re out on a date, sending unsolicited dick pics, and repeatedly telling me he’s single. I did not know he had a long term GF until a month ago. I have receipts, but I do not know how to best approach her about it :((

I honestly prefer to be anonymous as I don’t feel safe if he knew it was me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/10dhu0h/what_was_the_nicest_way_someone_has_told_you_your/,t2_vkpp30cs,2023-01-16 23:47:01,10,4
