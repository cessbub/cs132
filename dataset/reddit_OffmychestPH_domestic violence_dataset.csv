"[TW: Suicide, domestic violence] Doing it today","Please don't read kung andito ka lang para i-nitpick ang bawat detalye para masabi na fake 'to. Wala talaga ako sa tamang lagay para maging comprehensible lahat ng sinasabi ko, gusto ko lang talaga mag vent. Thank you

So now I'm here. I just finished writing my letters and I'm about to do it pero gusto ko pa magsulat ng paragraphs. Wala naman talagang magbabago sa ihip ng hangin at ikot ng mundo kapag namatay ako. Sadyang papansin lang talaga ako 🤣 Anyway ito 'yung mga rason bakit mas napush ako sa idea na magpakamatay. Siguro mababaw pakinggan, pero bago pa nito I already had an identity crisis because a friend told me that she took advantage of me the whole time naging friends kami. I was also being bullied at school. And I just live a sad life simula bata pa ako. From abusive parents, to insecure siblings, to bad luck in friendships, and to undesirable appearance and personality. Nakakahiya. Sa tuwing may magandang nangyayari parating nasusundan ng kamalasan. I don't want to be around anymore LOL parang pest lang ako sa mundo goodbye and if you read the whole thing, salamat.

"Don't be an idiot like me. Wag puro aral. (TW: domestic violence, abusive parenting)","For context, I'm in my late 20s and have been a working professional for over 7 years now. I have high competencies in hard skills related to my careers, pero sobrang kulang ako sa soft skills. I'm that ""high IQ but low EQ"" type of person.  
  
Bakit?  
  
Kasi masyado kong sineryoso ang academics. Yung pagiging ""magaling"" sa mga bagay bagay yung ginawa kong buong personality ko.  
  
Growing up, I had stereotypical Asian tiger parents. My dad always pushed me to not just excel, but to be THE BEST. He often compared me to my peers, especially those who were doing better than me academically. I was a consistent honor student noong elementary, pero salutatorian lang and disappointed siya na hindi daw ako VALEDICTORIAN. I went to Pisay noong high school and he often compared me to other people na nakakakuha ng mataas na grade, especially sa top 1 namin na nakapasok ng Harvard, while completely ignoring the fact na I was already struggling with mental health issues. I took up architectecture kasi feeling ko ang bobo bobo ko talaga sa STEM subjects (na later on, na realize ko na hindi naman pala, I was just comparing myself to my batchmates because duh it's Pisay) kaya I needed something to set me apart from the rest. So creative path yung kinuha ko (Architecture). Even then, he compared me to my peers who were better than me at drawing kasi galing sila sa high school na may technical drawing, even if I was getting 1.0 in my Math and Physics subjects. Before graduation, he got so mad at me that I'm not an honor student and blamed everything from my hobbies to my jowa at the time kaya daw hindi ako nakatutok sa pag-aaral at napataas ang grade ko. It sometimes came to a point where he would hit me with belts and paddles (yung type na ginagamit sa frat hazing pero may Bible verse pang nakasulat) if I didn't get good grades.  
  
Parang kahit anong mangyari, he would compare me to others sa ibang bagay na kulang ako and would blame everything else non-academics related for distracting me. Kaya I had this constant need to prove myself na magaling ako at ito rin ang naging ugat ng self-esteem issues at lack of self-confidence ko kung hindi ko magawa.  
  
I guess ito yung dahilan kung bakit nalagay yung internal sense of value ko sa achievements at sa pagiging magaling. Iniisip ko na ito ang magbubuhat sa akin sa careers ko pero hindi pala. Andami ko pang kulang. Hindi ako natuto kung paano makisama at makipag-socialize, kaya nahihirapan parin ako humanap ng networks ngayon at halos wala na rin akong social circle. Medyo kulang din ako sa leadership at sa sense of responsibility. Puro aral at grades kasi ang nasa isip ko dati kaya hindi ako naging active sa mga clubs and orgs. Kaya pagdating sa corpo world, ako yung tipong nagsosolo sa office at palaging overlooked kasi hindi ako nakikisama sa ibang tao.  
  
Naging sobrang seryoso nga ako sa buhay and a lot of people found it boring kaya hirap na hirap ako when it comes to making new friends and maintaining old friendships. Now I'm almost 30 and still feel like I'm playing catch up to make up for lost time.  
  
\---  
  
I have a younger cousin who went through the same tiger parenting bullshit as I did. His mom was the same as my dad, and he ran away from home because of some shit that she pulled on him related to academics and grades, including the domestic violence. I'm actually proud of him for pushing through with it. He's currently living with me at my place and he's now graduating this year. I'm thinking that one way I can redeem myself is to be like a father figure to him and not have him go through the same shit as I did, so I would often sit down with him to talk about life and I would actually be there for him to be a supportive kuya. He's actually doing a lot better in school now, a lot better than I did even, ever since he separated from his mom. Now I'm trying to convince him not to invite her at his graduation, which I sincerely hope he does.

**TL;DR Masyadong sineryoso ang pag-aaral at pagiging magaling because my parents pressured me. Became socially inept and maladjusted because of it. Now trying to be a positive role model to my younger cousin so he won't end up like me.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/13veph3/dont_be_an_idiot_like_me_wag_puro_aral_tw/,t2_7kbsbayo,2023-05-30 11:04:27,7

Violence Against Men,"TW: Physical Abuse

It just feels disappointing that men have no legal protection against any form of abuse or domestic violence. I (M31) had an ex gf who used to hurt me physically, and it occurred many times. Note that I did not cheat on her nor committed any grave offense against her. But everytime her emotions piled up, she used to hurt me physically, as in I got slaps on my face, arm, etc. 

After 9 months, I called it quits. I did not stand the abuse anymore. 

While women and children have legal protection, men are ought to just endure it and shut up, otherwise we will be viewed as weak ass pussies. Pardon the french.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/183less/violence_against_men/,t2_jhn2qk11,2023-11-25 22:54:38,9
emotional roulette,"the usual. wala namang bago, but i can feel it taking a toll on me na talaga both mentally and physically. walking on eggshells sa araw-araw, sasabayan mo pa ng pakiramdaman sa mga tao sa paligid mo na para bang roleta ang emosyon. do i get the calm attitude? do i get the aggressive one? (always the later haha) sobrang nakakapagod manghula, mag-abang, at maging cautious all the time. do i only get verbal abuse, or do i get the side of physical threats this time as well? buti na nga lang its been months since the last physical thing that i've experienced and all that i have to worry about at this moment are the verbal things.

hindi na natalab sakin 'yung hayaan na lang pumasok sa isang tenga, labas sa kabila. namumuro na ko to the extent na lagi na kong na-ttritrigger and be on the verge of relapse every time i hear someone raise their voice, or just even talk. sobrang rattled ko na lately, my neck and head hurts, and hindi na napapawi yung antok sa katawan ko.

Nag away kami ng gf ko ng dahil sa nagkapikunan at naghiwalay din kami,"my girlfriend and I had a serious fight

We had a debate habang kami nasa office, then alam kong napikon na siya since dadalawa lang kami naka duty that time. Hindi ko intensyong magkaroon kami ng ganong argument and she walked pass through me and sa akin thinking na nagkaroon lang kami na parang biruan, so I slapped her butt (thinking na nabibiruan pa kami at un ung mali ko) she acted na bakit daw ako nang pisikal, tapos  binatukan na niya ako, sinuntok and the worst part she stabbed me with a ballpen multiple times and hindi pa siya don nakontento, I tried to calm her down but she didn't so she grabbed a stapler and tried to smash me with it, that time I stood up and hinawakan ko ung monoblock chair para di na siya lumapit pa then lumapit pa din siya and ayun nga nakatayo siya sa harap ko, habang hawak ko naman ung monoblock chair tapos dahil sa reflexes ko dahil inambahan niya ako, I accidentally shoved the monoblock chair dahil sa gulat and nabitak ung lips niya. Then pumunta siya sa police station to file a vawc case. Pero sabi sa police station pag usapan muna daw namin by monday at maghaharap kami doon.

For us men, hindi ino honor sa pinas ung domestic violence which is genderless dapat di ba. It'a not my intention to shove her with that chair dahil na din sa human reflexes ko, and hindi ako nananakit ng babae dahil wala din naman akong balak gumanti and paano naman ako na butas butas yung katawan dahil sa pananaksak niya ng ballpen. 

Anyways, I know also my right and alam kong hindi ko intensyong manakit. It was my reflexes kung bakit naging ganon ang nangyari dahil tao lang din naman ako na nasasaktan ng pisikal at bago pa nangyari yon pinagsalitaan din niya ako ng masasakit at pinagmumura which leads to emotional damage and trauma.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/189eg42/nag_away_kami_ng_gf_ko_ng_dahil_sa_nagkapikunan/,t2_p31wobxuo,2023-12-03 06:09:41,1

Happy Father's Day sa Ating mga Single Moms :),"I woke up yesterday groggy and exhausted. I barely had a wink. What woke me up was my Dodong and Rosing's sloppy kisses. 

""Mama, wake up na. Bangon na. Love gud ka namo. Happy Father's day and Mother's Day Mama.""

That was all it took for me to tear up and cry. I hugged them for more than 20 seconds (yeah, we do this 20 second hug every morning). I thought to myself that how could I have forgotten that there are these two little creatures who love me incessantly and without qualms. 

It's been three years, going into four years since I left my husband because of domestic violence, emotional and yeah, sexual abuse. Leaving him was not an overnight decision. It was gradual. I woke up everyday, praying that we surpass these trials (sorry, for the lack of better term) but neglect, apathy and rage were always present. 

When he saw my payslip that night of October 2019, he was furious. Issues of me being superior, being mayabang and ambisyosa resurfaced. I never saw those traits in a negative way. It was not my fault that because of my hardwork and determination, I got promoted. All I wanted was a good life for my kids. That they don't experience the hardships I have experienced as the breadwinner of the family. I can't bear the thought of putting that much weight on their shoulders. I want them to dream. I want them to succeed and I want them to think that it will never be their responsibility to provide for us (their parents) when we grow old. 

While I was thinking that my wins are ""our"" wins, he thought otherwise. He allowed this tiny niggling voice in his head to swallow his love for me. Until all that's left of him was his bruised ego and pride. I get his point. But I don't understand why he chose to hurt me. Why he chose to see me cry and hurt. 

Five years then I had enough. I upped and left. I was contemplating that I would rather my kids grow up in a broken family than a dysfunctional one where violence is tolerated. I promised to myself that I will pour out all the love inside of me just so that Rosing and Dodong won't have to look for love in the wrong places. I will surround them with people who can love them as much as their father can. 

Three years, going on four years of working very hard just so that they feel that they are not lacking in material things. We go on dates. We go on long walks. What I won't give for them to not feel the loss of their father. 

So yun, to all the mothers out there who are incessantly working night and day for their kids. For all the mothers who loves unconditionally and unwaveringly their kids, saludo kami sa inyo. We got this! Fighting :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/14cyfkm/happy_fathers_day_sa_ating_mga_single_moms/,t2_bobk4dkcq,2023-06-19 07:29:45,15
im terrified of waking up at around 5-6 am,"Natatakot/ninenerbyos ako tuwing maalimpungatan o magigising tuwing 5-6 ng umaga. Natatakot akong makawitness ng pananakit ni mama sa kay lola tuwing pinapaihi niya siya sa ganiting oras. Si lola kase may dementia, oo aminado ako kahit ako naiirita na rin kay lola. Kasi naman pag nagkadementia pahabaan talaga ng pasensya yung challenge at most of the time pag hindi namin uto pinapaihi ng ganitong oras eh umiihi ito sa diaper niya at nababasa pati yung bedsheet. Kaya ayun minsan pag maganda mood ni mama maayos ung trato kay lola, kung hindi naman eh alam niyo na. Ilang beses din kaming nag away ni mama dahil dito eh wala pa ring pagbabago. Walang ibang nag aalaga kay lola kami lng dalawa ang malala pa eh may downsyndrome din kami dito. Sinabihan ki rin nmn sya na humingi ng tulong kela tito eh ayaw rin nmn niya.

Ewan ko ba bat ganito buhay ko. Di ko alam kung gano kalaking kasalanan nagawa ko sa past life at bakit ganito kabigat kinakarga ko. (Madami pa pong issue sa buhay ko na dumadagdag dito di ko nlng pi sasabihin out of topic na eh).

Gusto ko lng nmn ng peace of mind yung tipong hindi ako araw2 na matatakot matriger nmn ung ptsd ko from witnessing domestic violence nung childhood ko. Para na akong mababaliw, plus pa ung pressure at stress habang nagrereview for boards kase panganay ako. 

*Ps: nag away nmn kami ulit ni mama, ayoko rin naman mapagsalitaan sya ng masakit kaso hindi talaga nakikinig, always making excuses everytime i say lets talk and its driving me crazy.

Atheist,"LONG POST AHEAD

I grew up in a studious family. Nagsisimba tuwing Linggo, nagdadasal bago kumain, and nagdadasal bago matulog. I used to thank ""god"" for my life, my meal, and everything I had.

Every Sunday, nagkikita-kita kami ng mga kapitbahay sa simbahan, minsan may mga bigayan pa ng pagkain after church.

I was also a sacristan occasionally and became part of our school's church choir. Finished the Bible 3 times. May mga laman na kekwestyunin mo din talaga. If I remember correctly, dapat hindi sinasamba ang kahit ano mang bagay bukod sa diyos. Yet, some people pray to wooden and ivory figures glorified with gold and jewels.

Moving to a Catholic school, Sunday church service was open to the public. Sobrang dami kong na-encounter na literally palabas ng simbahan, nagtutulakan, nagchichismisan about sa kung ano, nagmumurahan na matatanda, etc.

Ginagawa nalang bang alcohol ang simbahan ngayon? Pang-linis ng weekly kasalanan? Don't get me wrong. I'm not pertaining to everyone who goes to church; but those who treat it as a weekly  chore. Oh btw, I attended a church service and the ""priest"" pointed out women who were wearing shorts and told them that what they're wearing is the reason why they're being cat-called. Victim blaming much? Another priest stated that ""pamamalo"" is a sign of pagmamahal. Normalizing domestic violence?

Once I turned my back on religion due to my utter disgust of people who continually display hypocrisy; people around me started questioning me. I felt free when I did it. I depend on no one else but myself. I won't be asking for forgiveness, but I'll correct my wrongs myself. No written rules to follow to check on my moral compass.

""Bakit? Kasi hindi binigay ng ""diyos"" yung gusto mo?""

""Kaya ang dami mong problema kasi hindi ka nagsisimba.""

""Ipagdasal mo lang yan. Lilipas din yan.""

Fuck no. People who try to shove their beliefs down your throat are the fucking worst of the bunch. Yes, naniniwala ako na religion provides comfort and peace of mind sa ibang tao - pero hindi lahat.

Kung magdadasal ka lang, hoping things will change? Sorry to disappoint you; it fucking won't.

""Nasa ""diyos"" ang awa, nasa tao ang gawa."" Isn't that it? ""God"" won't be raining down money, fix your problems, cure your disease, etc. If you won't take any action, nothing will fucking happen.

You do you, I guess. Hindi ko iniinvalidate yung practices ng religious friends ko and ng ibang tao. I still respect their beliefs. I'm just annoyed na ang daming taong sobrang dependent sa ""prayers"" and sa ""higher being"" na inaasahan nilang babago sa buhay nila. Atheists are treated with disgust most of the time. But guess what? At least hindi kami hypocrites.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/161r6su/atheist/,t2_yy9iv,2023-08-26 18:08:47,3

"Take care of your kids, most people don't deserve to be parents","I grew up in a very dysfunctional family, but as time passes by, my parents grew to be better people, we have our ups and downs but at the end it's hard to even compare the them now from 20+ years ago.

Unfortunately this isn't the case for every family, seeing very dysfunctional families isn't exactly uncommon for me, but it just hurts to see it.

I see kids emotional disconnected, I'll tempered, have major insecurity issues, sign of neglactful parenting, some kids get constantly compare to there other classmates or a more successful family members.

It's good to set expectations for a kid, but keep in mind that just child, that needs guidance, comfort, assurance.

I've seen many kids are just becoming investments to some family here in the Philippines.

I've seen a guy that was barely able to get out of poverty thanks to his parents hard work for paying for his tuition fees and necessary expense during his college years, but in exchange he became the bread winner of the family and now the responsibility are on his shoulders, the Parents also decided to have more kids and they expect him to pay for his siblings future education.

He has 5 current siblings, 2 of them are still just elementary students, while the other 3 are high school students and they expect him to handle the cost of their education, while handling their daily expenses too..

There is nothing wrong in helping family members that help you from the very start, but isn't this a tad abusive.

Other families exposed their kids to violence in such an early age such as domestic abused, alcohol fueled tantrums from either the mother or the father.

While other parents would give what ever their children wants, spoiling the lads to the point he/she grows up being a narcissistic brat or an individual that doesn't know how to navigate true life.

Kids need love, protection and comfort, they also need to be exposed to a bit of stressed and tough love to prepare them from the real world.

A parent job is to assure the basic needs of their kids are met, food, education, shelter, being a caring parent is the bare minimum that any kid can appreciate.

Parents peer pressuring kids to bare the responsibilities they should be providing from the start is just sad.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1apwt6n/take_care_of_your_kids_most_people_dont_deserve/,t2_pjrw2d1r4,2024-02-13 23:57:15,1
I disrespect my parents all the time because of a childhood trauma I never gotten over with caused by them,"I grew up with my parents constantly fighting, shouting, cursing, disrespecting each other, saying adult nasty things--this is more from my mom and feeling embarrassed all throughout my childhood. At some point I became numb where I no longer cry no matter how intense the fights gets. They got married and built a family at a very young age. Long story short, they never matured and they are selfish.

One time, they made an embarrassing public physical fight. My mom intentionally brought me and coached me how to physically attacked my dad's mistress. We were brought to the nearest police station and my dad ended up locked up in jail that night cos my mom is claiming she's a victim of domestic violence. She also said my dad physically hurts me and exaggerated it so much so my dad will be charged with child abuse. When in reality, my mom always lay hands on me too and it's their way of discipline. 

The case was filed and went up to the fiscal. My mom was so determined. She's vindictive and selfish and immature who has so much anger inside. She would force me to attend hearings even though I have exams at school. She made this case a priority. I would cry and tell her I dont want my dad to be locked up in jail but she would be so mad at me. It went on for years until one day she had to leave and work abroad. I think that's when it finally stopped.

Now that I have a family of my own, I get pissed off and easily annoyed when one of them would go to my house and tells me what to do with my child or with my life. I get easily triggered and unconsciously disrespect them. It's like my mind always remind me how awful they were as parents and I always respond irritably cos who gave them the right to fcking preach when they are both terrible parents up to this day.

I still hate my parents and I dont know how to get past to this. They say you become the thing you hate the most and hatred will consume you and will never make you happy. 

I tried therapy for a couple of times but I've learned that PH do not have much competent options for our mental needs. I talked to 3 different therapist and my experience was meh.

My dad was at least sorry and at some point, showed remorse for a shitty childhood they gave us. My mom on the other hand is completely delusional thinking I owe my current status in life (which is way better) to her and believes she was a good mother. On my wedding day, she didn't come cos we had an argument. Not really a major one but she got upset. My husband and I went to her a couple of times prior to the wedding to convince her (my husband mostly did) to come, not to mention I was pregnant at that time. How can a mother bear not attending to her child's wedding? how can a mother bear not check and look at her child when she just delivered a baby?

I dont know how to forgive a person who isn't sorry at all and never showed regret. My parents are old and I know I only got a few more years with them. Im supposed to reconcile and forgive them and  be take care of them but I dont know how to 😢",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1617qru/i_disrespect_my_parents_all_the_time_because_of_a/,t2_8cvz2us5,2023-08-26 02:52:15,3

I heard you had a kid from the guy you replaced me with.

what is this behavior?!,"so, mom spotted a brown 🐍. my dad recently watched a bunch of informative videos on youtube usually about wars and dangerous animals, snakes included, that it made me pray it doesn't trigger his inner violence. neither of them surprisingly freaked out. they were chill. dad even told mom to leave it be. mom only talked to the snek, ordered it to go look money for us, and such; she was also impressed that the noodle only stared at her, seemingly listening to everything she has to say to the point she labelled them as a sign of prosperity for us.

a little insert. it might seem strange, but it's normal for my family to talk to animals. my mom talks to her plants on the daily. i remember i was talking to one of her plants because i poured spoiled milk on their leaves (it was an accident >.>), so i had to clean them with water (it was also a secret deed, nobody shan't know). mom caught me speaking, beamed at the idea given i was situated near her plants and pouring water all over them then asked if i had talked to them (aka my siblings). she encouraged me and said more stuff to which i didn't reply because i had no idea what to say, i wasn't expecting to get caught. back to the topic:

i HAD to run outside to see it. the revelation, gosh, they were SO cute?! they were LITERALLY staring at us back. (here comes my thought of wishing i could domesticate them.) dad was also there, he was enticed. i think they got scared that they slithered away when i came, they must have felt cornered. my mom was smiling. she seemed happy. my dad was also chill with it. seriously, i'm just,, aAAAAAHHHHHH I'M SOFT

i know this probably means nothing, but it meant a lot to me. we have a long history of 🐍. as far as i know, mom is usually scared and alarmed around snakes. dad would also run to mom's aid then \*you know what na\*. so, yeah, i just feel so good today like that really happened, my heart. ❤",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/xaimot/what_is_this_behavior/,t2_nb23z8dy,2022-09-10 15:03:08,6
