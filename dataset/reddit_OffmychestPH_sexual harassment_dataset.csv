I got sexually harassed. I stood up for myself.,"It all happened when I was commuting going to school, early in the morning, kay aga aga may masamang nangyari sakin, 

Nakaarrive ako sa terminal na pinagsasakayan ko - bus, dahil malapit na mapuno ang bus, ang kulang nalang ay lima (5), isa ako sa limang kulang. Dahil nga may kulang nalang, nasa dulong bahagi na ako nakaupo ng bus, supposedly limang tao lang dapat ang nakaupo, pero 6 kami (may nakaupo na isa katabi ang bintana bago nagsabi ng may kulang pa na pasahero), ako ay nasa pagitan ng dalawang lalaki, 2nd to the last ako sa bintana which is on my right side, at sa left side ko naman ay yung gago, so siksikan. 

Habang nasa gitna ng daan, may kung ano mang akong nararamdaman sa dibdib ko, kaliwang(left) bahagi ng dibdib ko, nung una akala ko ay ang aking ID, dahil yakap ko sa aking harapan ay ang aking bag at pagitan nun ay ang ID ko, pinabayaan ko muna, pero dahil hindi nananahimik ang utak ko dahil iba na talaga ang nararamdaman ko sa dibdib ko, parang bang bulate't sinusundot ang kaliwang bahagi ng dibdib ko, 

Doon na ako natakot, nanginig, at malapit nang umiyak dahil sa pangyayayaring iyon, yung gagong katabi ko sa kaliwa ay daliri nya ang sumusundot sa kaliwang bahagi ng dibdib, hindi sa gilid ng dibdib kundi MALAPIT SA GITNA ng dibdib, dahil sinilip ko ng kaonti ang pagitan ng dibdib ko at bag, at doon ko natagpuan na hindi siko, DALIRI NYA, dalawang daliri (left hand, Index and middle finger), kumabaga ang posisyon ng arms nya ay naka crossarm sya, under ang left arm/hand, so patago nya na paulit ulit sinusundot ang dibdib ko, hindi ko na nabilang kung ilang beses nya ginawa dahil natakot ako, hindi ko alam ang aking gagawin, ang daming pumapasok sa isip ko, gusto ko lang naman makarating sa school, nakaranas pa ako ng ganon. 

Pero hindi tama iyon, harassment, crime na sya, hindi ako aalis at pupunta sa school na para bang walang nangyari, hindi ganon, hindi pwede, hindi pwede makakalayas sya nang ganon kadali dahil sa ginagawa nya, hindi, hindi ako pumayag. 

Sumigaw ako, umiiyak, sabay kuha ng kadiring dalawang daliri nung gago na nakapwesto nga sa kaliwang bahagi ng dibdib ko. Nagalit ako, nagmura, wala na akong pake kung sino man nakarinig, pero one thing for sure, rinig lahat ng mga pasahero, rinig hangang sa driver ng bus ang sigaw ko. 

Lumapit yung konduktor, ipinalipat ng bagong pwuesto yung gago, malayo sa akin, at sinabi sakin (yung konduktor) na mag reklamo ako, sumangayon rin yung ibang pasahero doon sa row ko. At doon ko na tinuloy ang reklamo ko, at buti nalang hindi sya pwedeng makababa, nagalit yung driver at hindi sya papayagan makababa yung gago. 

Hangang sa may nadaanan kaming mga pulis at doon kaming parehas ibinaba at doon ko itinuloy ang reklamo ko. 

At alam nyo pa kung ano ang mas nakakagago? 

Habang nilagay ko ang narrative ko, and personal info, nilagay ko rin yung kay gago since sya ang suspect, and ano ang nakita ko? 

Barangay Tanod sya, yung gagong iyon ay isang barangay tanod. 

Na hindi man nya alam ang Anti-Bastos law? Puta sya. Ang kapal ng mukha nya.




Please sa mga kababaihan, sa mga tao, wag kayong matakot na magreklamo, ipagtanggol nyo ang iyong karapatan, protektahan nyo ang sarili nyo, ni hindi ko alam kung bakit tayo pa ang gagawa ng mga paraan para lang maging safe tayo sa mga ganitong mga pangyayari kung pwede nalang silang maglaho, yung mga gantong klaseng tao.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/16uc1pq/i_got_sexually_harassed_i_stood_up_for_myself/,t2_jjw4azjc,2023-09-28 18:14:10,458
Bullied and Sexually harassed,"Since I was in elementary, nabubully na ako because I'm fat. Fat, fat, fat. I used not to care until high school. I always feel like there's something wrong with my body, I liked my body but their words made me hate it. Until my father say something bad na rin about my body, kesyo ang taba ko na, kahit pati sa pagkain pinipigilan ako kahit unang subo ko palang, that's when I started being so sensitive, na da down ako palagi when they say something about my body, ang dali dali ko na ma offend. I don't go out often. Nagkukulong na ako sa kwarto. My college days were just the same, new people, new bullies. And stress eating na rin. I hated my body even more, it ruined my mental health, I started thinking of suicide. Madalas, madalas ang suicidal thoughts. Kahit na may mga taong tumitingin sakin feeling ko na jina judge nila ako. May one time na sobrang na bully at napahiya ako, walang gabi na hindi ako umiiyak, pag nasa kalsada ako iniisip ko na magpapasagasa nalang ako. I was a mess, palagi nalang masikip dibdib ko. 

Year 2022 I had my first job and the worst. I don't want to mention names of the company. 3 lang kami babae (including the supervisor) sa workplace and the rest lalaki na. Halos lahat pamilyado, may mga anak na babae pero hindi marunong rumespeto. They verbally harassed me, na ang sarap ko daw makas3x, hindi ko madefend sarili ko dahil puro sila lalaki, nagtatawanan pa after masabi yon, umiyak ako pauwi sobra. Yung isa kong ka workmate na babae, minanyak nung guard, kung saan siya nakaupo, inaamoy niya yung upuan. Nalaman namin yon dahil may nagsumbong. A week after, may isang nagsabi sakin na ginagawa din daw sakin yon nung guard, pero nanahimik lang sila. Parang ang unfair sa part ko. May isang utility din na grabe ang touching niya, kahit sinasaway ko na, ayaw pa din paawat. Grumabe yung mental state ko, sobrang lungkot ko, wala akong makausap non. Iniiyak ko nalang lahat pag uwi. Hanggang sa hindi ko na nakaya, nag pass ako ng resignation (I stated there na mag re render ako ng 30 days) kinausap ako ng supervisor ko, sinabi ko sakanya lahat, and the respond that I got was ""normal lang kasi mga lalaki"". I just don't get it. After a week of leaving that company I got admitted dahil sobrang stress ko, and hindi okay yung mental state ko. I can't even pray, napalayo loob ko kay God, sobrang layo. Kasi pakiramdam ko hindi siya nakikinig sakin, na ang useless ng prayers para sakin.

I went home, and it became worse. My Lolo, sexually harassed me. Grabe yung takot at panginginig ko non, kahit mismo yung papa ko iniisipan ko ng masama. Nanginginig ako pag lumalapit si papa sakin kasi nasa isip ko baka gawin niya din sakin yon. Hinihimas ni lolo yung braso ko, at hahalikan sana but I managed to avoid kaya cheeks ko lang nahalikan niya sabay sabing ""gabi gabi kita iniisip, kahit sa paghiga ko"". Sobrang down na down ako, sinabi ko sa auntie ko na medj close ko, and she told everything na din sa family ni mama, kasi side yun ng mama ko. Wala na ako grandparents sa side ng papa ko. After that, binaliktad pa ako. Kesyo ako daw nang akit at ginusto ko rin. Parang mabaliw ako non, sleepless nights. Kasi baka ano gawin niya sakin. Halos gusto ko na siyang patayin. Kapag naririnig ko boses niya nanginginig ako at naiiyak. Dahil sa sobrang depressed ko, I cut myself, I left so many scars especially on my wrist. I was so messy and fucked up, hindi ko maayos ayos sarili ko non, palagi umiiyak. Hanggang ngayon nasa bahay parin namin si Lolo. 

But now that I have my second job, na le lessen yung pagiging suicidal ko kasi grabe ang blessed ko sa workmates ko. They're so kind and positive.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1b36a4g/bullied_and_sexually_harassed/,t2_nt6tk31vu,2024-03-01 01:41:51,8
[Sexual Harassment] Tinangka na naman akong gawing querida,"Ganito nalang ba palagi? Pangalawang lalakeng childhood friend ko na to na nanggulo sakin kahit may asawa / live-in partner / fiancee na sila.

Itago ko nalang sya sa pangalang Jason. Jowa ko sya nung high school. Matalino, magaling magsalita, medyo mayaman rin. Nung una magkaaway kami pero eventually na super inlababo ako sa kanya. Kaya niligawan ko at naging kami.

E may ibang gustong gawin si Jason. Di ko nalang sasabihin pero ayaw nya sa sex daw --- kasi may **ibang fetish** sya. E ako nga inlababo so binigay ko kahit ayoko naman talaga. Ginagaslight ko pa nga sarili ko na gusto ko yun kahit di naman.

EDIT: For the record, wala akong problema sa kink at fetish (meron din ako)...pero ang importante kasi ay MAY CONSENT at hindi mo pinipilit ang tao kahit ayaw nila.

Eventually nalaman ko na may pinopormahan sya sa school nya. So I broke up with him. Pero tanga nga, di ko binlock. Hanggang ignore lang. Kahit na may mga gf sya, nag memessage siya na humingi ng 'session.' Di ko pinapansin. Mga 10 years na ganyan yata. Minsan pumupunta pa nga sya sa bahay namin sa probinsya pag alam nya nandun ako. Tumatago lang ako at dinededma sya.

2024. Nagising ako na may halos 30+ missed calls. Tapos may tumawag. Antok na antok ako kaya sinagot ko. Si Jason pa rin, humihingi ng 'session.'

Chineck ko FB nya after almost 5 years. Puta, **kaka propose nya lang sa fiancee nya nung December**.

Nag panic attack ako. This is not the first time a married (or about to be married) man tried to make me complicit in their cheating. At ayaw na ayaw ko yan. Grabeng trigger ko yan. Nag breakdown ako ng malala.

Ganito nalang ba talaga tingin nila sakin? Kesyo open-minded ako at single pwede na nila akong babuyin ng ganito? Puta may mga morals pa ako. Kahit mag-alok pa sila sakin ng isang milyon, di pa rin ako tatanggap kung di gusto ng partner nila.

Binlock ko na talaga sya sa lahat. At gumawa ako ng Google Doc letter para sa fiancee nya, complete with screenshots. Pero sinabihan ako ni ate na wag nalang isend kasi daw baka aawayin pa ako. Seryoso na allegations ang sexual harassment na ginawa nya sakin. Pwede syang matanggalan ng lisensya. At may kapit ang pamilya nya sa pulitiko. Baka daw sasampahan ako ng cyberlibel. Kahit matatalo sila, mapapagastos at masestress pa rin ako.

Since then parang palagi nalang akong on the edge. Minsan galit, minsan breakdown. I feel so dirty. Kahit ngayon naiiyak ako. Ilang years na akong medyo okay sana pero puta ganito pa talaga ang start ng 2024 ko.

Kaya kayong mga gagong tao na nagche-cheat sa mga partner nyo. Sana iwan nyo nalang partner nyo pag di nyo naman nakukuha ang gusto nyo. Kaysa mandamay pa ng ibang tao lalo na yung mga ayaw naman ng ganyan.

And Jason, fuck you. I will talk to my lawyer friends and I will make you pay, some way or another.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/19efil4/sexual_harassment_tinangka_na_naman_akong_gawing/,t2_s1d5z,2024-01-24 20:01:43,49
"I was sexually harassed, now I feel like all men are manyak.","TLDR: Minanyak ako ng band lead while in vacation and now its affecting how I interact with men in general.

I went to Iloilo to travel, when I was single I always travel alone kasi wala naman ako mahila na friends kaya I learned to enjoy my own company. I’ve been to Vigan, Sagada, several mountains, beaches, Malaysia all alone and ngayon lang ako naharass. I guess what I’m trying to say it this is really my thing, d dahil broken ako or what.

My boyfriend at this time was also somewhere out of the country for work, he knows about my Iloilo trip and was very supportive about it. 

Now I’m the type or traveler na very chatty, as in. I like talking to locals, knowing their stories and what goes on in their life, this is how I enrich my experience, kahit magisa ako I always come home with a happy heart kasi full ako ng love nila due to their hospitality. 
Mahilig din ako tumanggap ng deals, as a solo traveler madaming nag o-offer ng extra food to taste, free rides and free activities - only heaven knows kung naka ilang free shit na ako, mabait din kasi ako as per them.

Anyway eto na, first night ko palang sa Iloilo hinatid ako ng owners ng kinainan kong famous batchoy-an sa airbnb ko, husband and wife sila and super kind. They dropped me off around 10:00 PM. Kaso, dahil maaga pa, nainip ako I went to a party place in Iloilo at around 12:00 AM, parang Poblacion nila kasi wala naman ako ibang mapuntahan na bukas ng ganung oras. Anyway I only went there to be entertained, comedy bar sana pero wala naman so when I heard a band playing, dun ako pumunta. 

This is where it starts. I was just minding my own business, drinking and watching the band lang. Maaga sila natapos mga 1:00 AM so nagulat ako kasi in Manila they continue playing till 4:00, actually felt stupid kasi sayang lang punta ko kasi saglit lang pala.

Then one of the band members approached me, ayan na nag start na yung ugali ko na akala mo nagfifilm ng documentary. From there, isa isa ng lumapit the rest of the band members, I was the only female pero I really didn’t mind kasi in my head gusto ko lang magkwento at makinig. I didn’t even drink a lot kasi babae ako eh and need to go home pa. Everyone was just having a good time lang, behave lang ako nakaupo tas sila nagbabaliwan sa gilid, nanonood lang ako at nakikitawa. One of the band members asked if they can drive me home, I declined kasi sabi ko I can manage, plus nandun lang sakayan ng taxi. Then isa isa ng umuwi band members, syempre nag paalam na din ako, the guy who first offered a ride home went out na din. Natira kaming apat with the band lead. 

Ngayon since konti nanga lang kami, I went to say my goodbyes na, but the leader insisted that he drives me home kasi dangerous daw. Syempre I declined. Kaso sabi nila jinajudge ko daw sila, wala naman daw silang gagawing masama sakin, grabe daw ako sakanila. Eh ang nasa isip ko nadin, regular sila tumutugtog dito so they wouldn’t ruin their reputation right? I knowwww it’s very stupid and naive of me, so dahil nahiya na din ako edi sumama nako, tyaka libre eh. 

Eto na, when we got in the vehicle the conversation was still very wholesome, until nag start na sya mag notice sa nails ko, gel polish daw yun and kissed my hand? I pulled it away agad Tangina kinikilabutan ako pag naaalala ko, I reminded him ulit that I have a boyfriend, I also told them this when they asked when I was single nung nasa bar palang, even showed them photos para clear na no agenda. And then I was kind enough pa to give him advices kasi nag dadrama sya na ang sarap ko daw siguro mag mahal kasi faithful ako sa bf ko now, tyaka lambot daw ng hands ko, I’m pretty and masarap kausap. Naisip ko nakainom lang to, what I didn’t expect was when he started to become aggressive and hugged me, tinutulak ko pa gently and I was saying I want to get off the car na, but he tightened his hug saakin and thats when I felt scared, kaya I was trying to open the door na but he kept pulling it close. I calmed him down nalang and kept sniffing the side of my neck, I then said I needed to pee, ayaw pa nya ko pababain nun but I said I might pee sa car nya so he let me go down, I went straight to the taxi na and just sat there in silence, iniinternalize ko pa what just happened. 

Kaso d pa dito natatapos, pag drop sakin ni kuya taxi, d ko na sya pinatawid, sabi ko ako nalang tatawid so he left me sa otherside ng road. Nagulat at kinabahan ako kasi I saw his car pullingover kung saan ako nakatayo, he fucking followed me home. He got off the car and he kept apologizing, ako I was just talking calmly and dismissing him kasi I just want to be inside the airbnb and be safe. 

Feeling ko ang ditry dirty ko kaya I went to the shower crying, I was so scared and disgusted, I also felt so stupid. I called my bf right away and told him everything. I spent the rest of my vacation in Iloilo na nagpapablotter, he isn’t allowed to play na dun sa restobar d ko na makasuhan kasi pinapabalik pako Iloilo also I don’t want to see him na.

Ngayon kahit genuinely nice na yung manong, like a tricycle or taxi or enforcer pag nag o-offer na na ihatid ako or nag iinsist sila to assist me even when I say “dito na lang po kuya”, bumibilis heartbeat ko and I start to feel uncomfortable. I’m trying to brush it off kasi I know they aren’t all bad. I worry kasi baka d nako maging jolly person when talking to manongs when I travel, feeling ko lahat mamanyakin ako.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/18hf9h2/i_was_sexually_harassed_now_i_feel_like_all_men/,t2_8wxik0bvv,2023-12-13 20:00:34,48
Men who are victims of sexual harassment.,"Just wanted to shed light with this topic. As a man, I actually have some experiences. 

&#x200B;

\- In college, there's this 1 girl na kabatch namin na sobrang touchy to the point na questionable na yung touches niya. On my personal experience, nararamdaman ko yung chest niya na nakapress sa body ko on multiple instances. Other guys na kakilala ko had the same experiences from her. There's also some additional things that she does. She's also very touchy with her hand. May it be sa arms, body, shoulders, etc. There's also an instance that this girl touch and hinihimas hinas na yung legs ng friend ko, around crotch part na. 

&#x200B;

\- I was partying at a club once, then this gay man na nasa dance floor with us. I was just dancing actualy, then hinawakan niya yung arms ko and kinagat niya. I was frozen at that time. Parang wala na rin ako nagawa. Natameme na lang ako. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/14nlob3/men_who_are_victims_of_sexual_harassment/,t2_ej9vzy81c,2023-07-01 12:36:20,11
Conflicted kung magpapapayat ba because of many sexual harassment stories,"So for context, I'm currently obese and I want to loss weight and wear cute clothes and the likes. But natatakot ako sa mga possible scenarios na baka may mangharass saken cause I would rather endure bullying(verbal) than sexual harassment. Add to my fear pa na I will be working in a male dominated industry(ME).

&#x200B;

Tapos meron pang isang post sa ibang ph subreddit kung ano mga experience nila regarding the matter and hindi talaga maiiwasan. Even if may mangyari, I don't think may magagawa ako so since hindi naman kami mayaman or may power. Kaya as much as possible I want to prevent or atleast be less of a target (ofcourse not saying na just because you are fat doesn't mean that its impossible for one to be a victim).

&#x200B;

Pumayat na rin ako dati when I was in college and not to sound arrogant, I am attractive plus I've always been confident. Back then, a lot of seniors and tried to take advantage of me, thankfully I have friends who tells me things so nakaiwas ako sa mga ganong klaseng tao pero syempre andyan pa din yung mga naririnig mo na binabastos ka and so on. 

&#x200B;

Anyway onto the present, gained all the weight back and ang tagal ko ng dilemma ito. Ayun rant lang, I hate being a women. Being pretty has a lot of privileges pero at what cost.

Sexual Harassment,"I'm just disgusted sa mga ibang Pinoy on how they react on sexual harassment. If you're handsome or pretty and you're a victim of sexual harassment? Everybody will care, everybody will become your light shining armor. If panget ka, no one even bats an eye. They will even make jokes about sa nangyari sayo like me. I'm a victim of sexual harassment and I told what happened to my friends and ganito yung naging reply nila.

""May booking ka ba tapos ayaw mo sa kanya?""
""Lakas ng kamadag ni <Insert my name here>""

Yep. Habang nanginginig ako sa takot, ganyan yung mga sinasabi nila. They don't even bother to asked me if I'm okay or need ko ba ng kasamang umuwi.

Tama nga yung kasabihang.

How does anyone deal with sexual harassment at home?,"I’m losing trust and respect on my father

We used to be a happy family. I used to admire him.


But he cheated on my mom multiple times already.. and i was the one who caught him.. 

Isa sa mga babae niya was about 21 to 23 years old ata. Kaedad ko lang.

Then i once saw porn on his phone and it’s about families having sex together. Kadiri. Nakakatakot.


He would barge in my room without knocking. Minsan saktong pag nakahubad o nag bibihis ako. Whenever i go out of my room to go to the living room or kitchen, i would see his eyes wander sa legs ko.. minsan sa butt..


Di na ko lumalabas ng kwarto ng walang bra dahil grabe nga siya makatingin. Pero pag labas ko kanina para sana mag banyo, nakita ko siyang nakatingin sa dibdib ko.



Natatakot ako na naiiyak. Never naman niya akong hinawakan. But somehow, i feel violated. He even told me one time “kung di lang kita anak..” di na niya tinuloy. Joke niya lang yun pero nag marka sa isip ko.



Nahihirapan akong tanggapin na baka nga minamanyak ako nung tatay ko. Especially because i used to consider him as a hero. I used to have so much respect for him.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/qno0up/how_does_anyone_deal_with_sexual_harassment_at/,t2_g91ryvrn,2021-11-06 07:57:04,61
"TW: RAPE, SEXUAL HARASSMENT & PEDOPHILIA i suddenly remembered all the sexual traumas i experienced like wtf","hindi ko na mabilang pala kung ilang beses ako nasexual harass ever since bata pa ako. from matandang lalaki na friends ng mama ko and papa ko before to uncles (even sarili kong tatay) and to teenage boys na akala ko kaibigan ko sila pero yung mga utak napunta lang sa tite. halos nakalimutan ko na to lahat. all my life  pala i was fucking sexualized, there are also times na late ko na narealize i was violated and harrased. i'm 22 and maybe around 6-7 years old was the first time i was molested. i feel so fucking dirty. is this a trauma response? how could i forget everything... 


right now. i'm also dealing with my nudes leaking bcs of hacking. I DON'T FUCKING GET IT. it's like my life has revolved around me being sexualized. being used by my body. i know even at 17, i was raped by my ex (the only time i was raped and thank the gods, hindi na naulit) and lost my virginity to him. boys would only approach me bcs of my body during my teens. there were times na pumayag nalang ako, pretended that i liked it but i never did. one of few regrets i'm reliving tonight. 

ano ba kasing meron sakin? malandi ba talaga ako? do i really look like uhaw ako sa titi? i know myself i don't, kaya ko mabuhay ng walang sex. i don't get easily turned on. depende nalang kung mahal kita. i have only given myself to people that i have loved. i had 5 exes. sometimes, pag binabastos na ako ng tao wala na akong pake. if being catcalled in public i would raise my finger at them. i can't say na masungit ako bcs when people greet me in public i would smile at them, even with stranger men, sometimes i would just avoid contact dahil di ko mapipigilan sarili ko na if they greet me i would eventually greet back, the same as through messaging apps i struggle when someone i know or an acquaintance would dm me i would feel rude if i don't reply. i recently knew that some of those people mistake that act of kindness as my move to show interest for them. that behavior of mine applies to all people in general. i can never ignore someone i know, unless they don't greet or talk to me first. my recent ex told me i was easy for it. i was too easy for men. was i really? should i change this behavior? 


mukha ba akong porn star? hindi naman ako kasing ganda at kasing sexy ni riley reid or lana rhodes para masexualize buong buhay ko. i don't even wear that much exposed clothes. not also the girly type manuot or even the skimpy ones (i have nothing against it). but why? bakit pa ako naging babae? ganito nalang role ng babae sa mundo? ang mabastos? maging katawan ng chismis na isang malandi, pokpok at kung anu-ano pa? and will not have to do anything about it kundi tanggapin nalang? accept the fate we'll be fighting for the safety of our bodies, of our well-being from disgusting men??? minsan talaga, kung hindi lang illegal pumatay. marami na talaga ang body count ko.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/13xtbq7/tw_rape_sexual_harassment_pedophilia_i_suddenly/,t2_9zbub6qtm,2023-06-02 05:04:34,7

[TRIGGER WARNING: R & SH] I WAS RAPED AND SEXUALLY HARASSED AND MY FRIEND TOLD ME BAKA DAW “NOT IN THE MOOD” LANG AKO,"Potangina. Since I was just around I think 12-ish or 13 up until 15, I was raped by my friend’s brother. It became a cycle and I never thought I was raped until I was 18. It’s when I started to realize na I was raped talaga because I was a minor and he used my vulnerability as a gay teen to manipulate me, and even today I can still remember na it was him who made me watch porn for the very first time and I even asked if totoo yun and sabi nya oo and so everytime he let me watch porn, he would do exactly the same to me sa video na he made me watch. Every time I get penetrated I feel so empty and frozen that time, speaking up or never coming back sa bahay ng friend ko was never an option to me before, that feeling na I was really hypnotized. Now I am 20 already, and last January 11, I had a drink with my fellow SK kagawads at the house of our colleague, and his brother sexually harassed me, I can still feel how he dampi his mouth at the back of my neck and would signal me with sexual hand signs discreetly. That incident triggered and freshened everything that had happened to me when I was regularly raped. I tried to open up to my fellow gay friend about it and he said baka not in the mood daw ako, I feel like I was stabbed and silenced. Ang hirap maging bading tapos ma sexually harassed ka and rape because people will not believe in you because of the stereotypes that has labeled gay persons to be. That is why pinili ko nalang maging silent, and I downloaded this app to vent out since I feel like I can no longer trust everyone in my circle.

My sexual harasser is thriving in the new neighborhood I live in and I want to expose him,"First off, we're both men.

I live in a new subdivision. Middle class.

Before we came here may FB group and group chat for upcoming residents. Met this dude who was interested in me and my bf, e me and my hubby sleeps with other men for fun sometimes, so we tried to arrange something for when we both live in the area.

Later on I found out that he has a longtime partner. So I asked, so will you bring your bf? He said, no this is a secret. Please don't tell that I do this on the side.

I got disgusted and mentally noted not the have sex with him because I hate cheating. Didn't tell him that tho but I stopped flirting on chat.

Fast forward to now we both live in the subdv. He said he will visit our house. I said I'm busy and my bf was away (he was at a gig). He insisted. To be polite I said sure. He hung out for a bit while I was working (my shift was on so I didn't want to entertain him fully) but we had convo. When he was about to leave, he slapped my ass. I was shocked, almost punched him. He said sorry.

That's when my bf and I stopped communicating with him. 

Now back to the group chat and the community. The dude who sexually harassed me has been slowly campaigning to be head of HOA. Sobrang PR nya. Nagpapainom. Buys drinks for midnight sessions. Now everyone (not me and my bf) calls him chairman.

Also somehow I feel ostracized in the group and the community. My posts get ignored for example. I feel like he badmouths me and my bf to his friends in the community.

I don't know what to do. I don't want to expose him but I just feel triggered whenever I see his posts and his success, I guess? What will happen to me in this community, in my dream house, if he succeeds in ostracizing us?",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/10o3o09/my_sexual_harasser_is_thriving_in_the_new/,t2_bdg6u,2023-01-29 17:19:16,3

I found out my gf had a fling with her own cousin,"**TW: Sexual harassment**

I’ll make this short. I learned that my gf had done it with her cousin before we were together after she told me that the [other night](https://www.toodat.com/community/Ifoundoutm/LoveLife/LkQWjnegRDdwZ1p0), her cousin tried doing it again with her by touching her inappropriately. I know it was a lot to process. Even now, I don't know how to feel. Anger. Disgust. Betrayal. I don’t know. I feel like she should have told me this earlier. I told some of my closest friends about it and I was just shocked by their response. They said it wasn’t that a big deal. One even said that he kissed his cousin before. It happens. But for me, it’s really weird since I see my cousins as my siblings.

Now whenever I see my gf’s cousin during their family reunions, I would think of what they have done in the past. Technically, she didn’t cheat on me but it kinda feels the same. Or am I overreacting? I’m now thinking about my future with her if it’s even possible.

""" I want to slice my face off""","Trigger wanting/Self Harm/Sexual Violation

""I want to slice my face off""

Was what I usually thought during my lowest low. There were times that I genuinely wanted to mutilate my face, that maybe if I did  that; random strangers wouldn't take pictures of me, that if I did that, I wouldn't get groped randomly, I wouldn't get cat called or followed by creepy weirdos on my way home.

Sexualizing boys is the norm, making light of being sexually harassed on the streets, especially if it was by girls. I understand that there are men out there who have never experienced being groped and  think that getting that attention is the best thing ever, but it's not. I hate the glorification of being sexually harassed as a guy, and I hate that people attribute it to my face. 

""ay gwapo ka kaya ganyan mga babae sayo""

""lucky mo naman, sana ako hinahawakan sa privates ng mga babae""

""haha, ganda mong lalake, yan tuloy pati matatandang lalaki nababading sayo""

These sentiments, although really nonchalant, really pile up whenever you're getting sexually harassed. No empathetic sentiments, no validation of your feelings, just pure envy, misunderstanding and glorification, and  if I do try to voice out, just a smidge of discontent, not even a full on arguement about how I truly feel, all I get  is:

""gusto ka na nga ng mga babae, nagrereklamo ka pa""

""sana all chickboy, maging proud ka na lang na sobrang gwapo mo na ginaganyan ka""

""buti ka pa, ako nga di ginaganyan e, wag ka na mag emote, tangapin mo na lang""

Not many people think that the  things they say stick with people, because these stuck with me to the point it dragged me down.  Is it really so lucky for me to get harassed as a child? is it really lucky for me to get groped and followed by creeeps? is it really so lucky for me to get raped for 2 years?

During the last two years of my highschool, when I was constantly violated  against my will, I would lean my back against the door, hoping that it was enough to keep the rapist from my safe space, and I would cry silently. I couldn't let anyone know how I felt, I couldn't let anyone see me  cry at all. Because ""men who cry are weak."" 

with the only constant thought "" I want to slice my face off""

Ofcourse, as much as I wanted to, as much as I held  the box cutter to my face, I couldn't do it. Multiple times I've brough it up to my face, and multiple times I felt it's cold grasp but  I couldn't bring myself to dig deeper. Silently, I would scream while holding the damn thing against my face, but I felt powerless, I couldn't even bring myself to cut the very thing plaguing my life. 

And it went on for a few more years until I eventually had enough and tried to end it all in 2020. 

Luckily I'm still alive, and it's all a few years ago already right? 

but;

As much as I claim that I've moved on, as much as I've claimed and lie to myself that everything is okay, that everything is done and everything is over; 

in truth its not. 

From time to time, I get nightmares. Nightmares of people raping me, night terrrors of people mutilating my still living body. I scream but no sound comes out. And whever I wake from these nightmares, The only comfort I have is to lay my back against the door, hoping to keep the imaginary monsters at bay.

And during those times as I stare into my dark room, reassuring myself that I'm safe, a thought resurfaces, a whisper carried by a phantom gust of wind;

""I want to slice my face off.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1akwkxd/i_want_to_slice_my_face_off/,t2_a3pd8jorv,2024-02-07 14:28:34,23
My life has been so liberating since I said goodbye to NSFW community ,I left an NSFW community almost two months ago and it feels so liberating since then. I had a hoe phase through NSFW chats only during my vulnerable times. I also did this to validate my femininity and explore my sexuality. There were many creepy men who harassed me in the chat inbox after they saw my explicit posts. I almost dived into hook-up culture but I realized it is harmful for my sexual and mental health. I was deeply shocked when I heard HIV cases in the Philippines are going higher and higher due to main reason: lack of sex education. I'm glad I still have my V-card which I am going to give it to my future lover. I don't want my parents to find out about this especially my father. My father might beat the shit out of me if he ever finds out his daughter becomes a hoe. I know my parents love me pero pakiramdam ko may kulang sa pagkatao ko. Buti na lang pinagsabihan na ko ng mga matitino at nakakatandang Redditors sa akin na wag na ako magpaloko sa mga lalaki dito. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1av0jss/my_life_has_been_so_liberating_since_i_said/,t2_vsc0koxo,2024-02-20 06:18:44,219
"At the age of 18, I realized I was actually groomed","TW: Pedophilia/grooming 

Hi. I'm 19 f and I just want this to get off my chest in this community. Please scroll up if you're not comfortable with this. 

I had my very first phone at the age of 11. Then my mom created an FB account for me and set my birth year 1995 instead of 2004 because I was too young to have my own FB account.

I was groomed at 12 by four men online who I believe they're 18+ dahil ang matured ng pag-iisip nila. One of them was 45 (he's even older than my father). Six years ago, a random guy added me to a Facebook group called Minecraft Bros. I loved Minecraft. That's where I met those men. They added me on FB probably because they are interested in me and started talking to me. I felt uncomfortable. I was also sexually harassed as well (This is actually the worst. He forced me to take off my clothes and take pictures of my naked body and send my nudes to him in messenger. Good thing I didn't do it). At 18, I realized they took advantage of me. Hindi ako masyado nag-reply sa mga messages nila kasi I felt uncomfortable nga. That dude who sexually harassed me was fucking gross. Gusto niya talaga ako manyakin. Several years later, I realized they took advantage of me. I was very vulnerable. When my father found out about this, he scolded me for adding suspicious strangers. He told me they're bad people. Afterwards, I blocked them. One of them even asked me to be his girlfriend and I'm glad I rejected him.

I don't want you guys to experience what I experienced when I was 12 coming from a victim of pedophilia.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/16xxnc3/at_the_age_of_18_i_realized_i_was_actually_groomed/,t2_vsc0koxo,2023-10-02 22:09:45,12
Moral dilemma in my hobby community,"TW: Sexual Harassment.

Talagang when you belong in a community di maiiwasan ang issues no? From the smallest unit of Family to the entire social structure lahat may issues. Friends, Work, Church, other communities talagang andon ang issues. 

After ng pandemic medyo naghahanap ako ng communities kasi naging lonely ako. I wanted a new group of friends, not because my old friends suck ha, pero I wanted new experiences with other people. May mga sinalihan akong GC, Subreddit, at Discord channels para maging active man lang. Aside from this, I took new hobbies at eto yung panggagalingan ng dilemma ko. 

I tried cosplaying para medyo tumaas naman self confidence ko. It worked naman, pakapalan lang talaga ng mukha hahaha! Masasaktan ka lang if you let people who dislike your costume and shame you for it get to you. Not a small feat, pero considerigf na minority naman yung mga ganong tao sa community, madali siyang gawin kahit parang mahirap. Most of the PH cosplayers are very welcoming to everyone.

Anyway naging involved na ako sa community na to kasi sumaya ako eh, it was a positive experience for me. Pero syempre not everything is a field of flowers.

Lately parang dumarami yung mga tao na nanghaharass sa cosplayers. Akala nila kasi welcome na for them yung medyo revealing na costumes. Ano gagawin ng cosplayer kung medyo skimpy manamit gusto niya icosplay? It's not consent. Ask for permission kung gusto mo picturan sila in a sexualized manner, hindi yung parang they are letting you do it automatically kasi ganon costumes nila. Simple lang naman di ba, ask for consent. And if they say no, respect it.

Dito papasok dilemma: Karamihan ng mga harassers ngayon sa mga cosplayers nasa autism spectrum. They are essentially PWDs. Socially awkward people na di naman alam social cues ganon. One of the so called ""harassers"" have child trauma pa nga. Yet they harass cosplayers verbally and physically. 

So ano gagawin ng mga cosplayers? Ipopost mga nanghaharass online. May actions like sasabihan mga event organizers or mall security para alisin yung mga harassers. Mga concerned party naman ng harassers dedepensahan yung nangharass, saying na dapat di pumapatol sa PWD and stuff.

Di ako directly affected but I am concerned. Ayoko naman na may mababastos, karamihan pa sa mga to eh minors. Ayoko naman din na mabully either side, gets ko naman kasi.

Kasi action ng cosplayer na naharass is to post it sa social meda kahit na tingin ko mali yon, tapos reaction naman ng kamag-anak ng nanghaharass eh depensahan yung harasser which is mali din kasi parang enabling na yon.

Just want other people's opinion on this. Wala namang tama or mali for me. Though iba opinion ko sa kung ano tama or mali legally hahaha! Yun lang naman. Nakakabother na din kasi.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/16zw44r/moral_dilemma_in_my_hobby_community/,t2_y3rt4,2023-10-05 03:24:08,5
MY ABUSIVE EX BOYFRIEND IS RUNNING FOR SK.,"trigger warning // mentions sexual harassment, rape and abusive relationship

I’m going to post this here kasi sobrang sama talaga ng loob ko ever since I (21F) saw several posters of my ex (22M) plastered all over our barangay and found out that he really was running for SK thru a friend of mine. Naiinis ako because hindi niya deserve. Hindi niya deserve maging SK Kagawad. Hindi niya deserve ang suporta na binibigay sa kanya ngayon ng mga taga-rito samin.

Every time that I see his stupid fucking face, nagagalit ako at naaalala ko kung paano niya ako trinato nung kami pa. From bullying me, physically, verbally and emotionally abusing me, and on top of that, sexually harassing and raping me, hindi niya talaga deserve maging SK Kagawad. Every time that I see his poster na naka-ngiti, I want to rip that poster and burn it. Worst of all, dahil maliit lang ang mundo, I see my facebook friends sharing the posts he uploaded while doing community service na ang caption ay “si (ex) ang SK ko! baka SK ko yan! serbisyong mabait at tapat!” and I can’t help but roll my eyes, dahil hindi naman totoo na mabait siya; and those same people are the ones na nag-push sa ex ko to sexually harass me for him to “be a real man and let go of celibacy”.

Your SK Kagawad fucking abused me throughout our 5-year relationship and here I am, two years later, still healing from the trauma he fucking left. Ang hirap lang, tangina. One minute I tell myself that I’m fine, the second I’m mad and crying dahil naalala ko lahat ng ginawa niya. Ang hirap lang kasi I remember speaking up about what he did to me, yet I ended up becoming the bad person dahil “mabait” at catechist siya sa simbahan – mas maraming naniniwala sa kanya, kesa sakin at hinding-hindi niya kayang gawin ang mga sinabi ko dahil anak siya ng Diyos, lol. Your SK Kagawad made me feel small, pakiramdam ko napaka-dumi kong tao sa mga pinaggagawa niya sakin throughout the whole duration of our relationship. Tangina, yang SK Kagawad niyo magaling mag-baliktad ng storya!

Your SK kagawad is a liar, abusive and rapist. He’s a fucking bastard, he doesn’t deserve that position. Kung siya ang future ng city na to o ng barangay na to, tangina. This city’s fucking dead.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/16052dd/my_abusive_ex_boyfriend_is_running_for_sk/,t2_i9kffpj62,2023-08-24 23:27:12,15
My wife kissed someone and gave a lap dance to her officemate,"EDIT: I can't believe I'm being tagged as a karma farmer just because I am good with words. Someone even made this conclusion na this is a social experiment. And here I thought this was a safe space where I can vent out stuff I would otherwise be ashamed to do so in person even with people I know. I can't believe I have to explain why I am how I am but here goes: to be good with words is part of what I do for a living, so it comes naturally to me. And yes, this is true and I did this as a replacement of having someone listen to me in person.

Yet here I am being judged in what I thought was a safe space for studd like this. But anyway. I'm anonymous here anyway, it's like you know me, right?

Hi. New and obviously throwaway account for reasons you probably already know.

My (M32) wife (F26) recently attended their work Christmas/year-end party. She has been with this company for more than 5 months now. She asked to go back to work again since it's been a while since she stopped when she had our baby.

Naturally, my assumption was that it would be a typical corporate event and it would be how like usual corporate events go: there would be a program, food, some games, some fun dancing and performances, the usual stuff. I even bought my wife a sexy cosplay costume since she said there would be an ""outfit of the night"" sorts of award for the event. I was like, cool let's aim for that. I spent around 7000 for a really nice outfit and a professional makeup artist for her.

So, fast forward to the event night. Bawal daw ang non-employee, so obviously I was not able to come with her. Hinatid ko sya sa event place, with her costume and full make up on. The event was supposed to end ng 12 MN, so I was waiting for her outside the venue by around 11:15 PM.

When people started coming out of the venue, I spotted her swaying with her coworkers. They were loud and laughing about something. Then, she looked over to another group elsewhere and blew a kiss to someone and waved goodbye.

She saw me and she froze. For whatever reason, her coworkers gasp and one even put her hand in his mouth in an ""oh shiiiiittt"" manner. Then they slowly part wats with awkward goodbyes.

She approached me and hugged me. She tired to kiss me but I turned away.

""Baby, bakit"" she asked, as I can smell the stink of alcohol from her breath. In fact, I think I already smelled it even before she approached me. Their entire group is *amoy chico.*

Now, for context: I don't drink. Never had, and maybe never will. My wife used to be a heavy drinker, but gave it up when we got together. It was a mutual understanding and no one was forced to do anything. So, she knows that I would have problems with her getting wasted like this. She knows this is something I am not comfortable with. And she knew this way back when we started dating.

I would have let this go and maybe just have a talk about her about it later and not make a big deal about it, since *anjan na at wala nang magagawa pa*. But what irked me was that SHE KNEW ALL ALONG that this would be a ""wild"" party, and not a formal/fun corporate party like I thoguht all along and what she made me believe, but she intentionally kept that as a secret from me. Despite knowing it's something I may be uncomfortable with.

""Inuman pala yan,"" I said flatly. "" Bakit hindi mo sinabi sa akin?""

""Sorry na mahal,"" she said, still in a drunk voice. ""Alam ko kasing di ka papayag eh.""

""Yun naman pala eh."" I said, now doing my best not to shout at her in a pubic area. ""Pero ginawa mo parin.""

Silence.

""At sino yun?"" I asked. ""Bakit may flying kiss pa?""

She acted coy. ""Ha? Alin? Nagbabay lang ako, anong flying kiss?""

But I know what I saw and I'm sure I was not imagining things.

""Niloloko mo na ako Anna eh. "" (not her real name)

""Baliw ka ba"" she said with almost a laugh. ""Sabi nga sa'yo, wala yun.""

Another silence.

And then I noticed something that sent chills up on my spine.

Her chest foams are gone. Now again for context: her costume had a tank top-like style and too make her boobs look bigger than it is, we used chest pads.

But now it's gone. How can it be gone?

""Ano nangyari sa paddding mo?""

""Ha? Nalaglag lang, napasayaw kanina eh.""

""So asan?""

""Nalaglag nga diba."" this time she sounded like she was getting annoyed.

Another silence. Without a word, I just ushered her tto the car and we drove home.

We were silent the entire drive home. Had it only been her getting drunk, I can let it pass since even some events do offer light alcoholic drinks. But what bothers the shit out of me are these unexplained things: the flying kiss to someone, the ""*opps nahuli*"" reaction of her workmates, and the missing breast pads.

We got home and she collapsed to her bed. We still didn't talk. For almost an hour, I'm just lying down, getting consumed by my thoughts and all the overthinking happening in my head.

And then there was a sound. And another sound.

It was her phone. It was the Messenger tone. With how fast the tone was beeping, it seems like it took a while before it loaded new messages when it connected to our home Wi-Fi.

I don't know what got over me, but I grabbed her phone form her bag, exited the bedroom towards the living, and explored her phone. It was Messenger and it was form the group chat with her co-workers.

What I saw almost made me pass out, and at the same time, I  almost punched a hole through our concrete wall.

He coworkers were talking about what she did in the party.

First, she kissed this one guy in what seeemed to be a ""longest kiss"" challenge. In the video snet by one of her co-workers, she took one shot of a dirnk and then grabbed this guy and smothered his mouth. People counted.

One.

Two.

My heart sank with each count and each time she kiss that man. It's not *just* a kiss. It was a torrid kiss. *Talagang laplap ang ginawa niya.*

After a full minute, she let go of the guy, gave home one more quick smack on the lips, pushed him a little, and waved him bye. Then people cheered and she danced with the cheering crowd.

Just when I thought this is too much for me to handle, there was a second video. This time, it seemed to be one of those ""new hire"" stage challenges. They were chanting some dude's name and this one guy went on stage and sat on a chair. After the host asked for another female ""volunteer,"" eventually Anna was the one egged to go on stage. She willingly went. Again, the crowd cheered and aside from the one who took the video, I can see many more others taking a video for this exciting moment, whatever it is. Then the host cued for the music.

It was some kind of erotic sax music and to my shock, my wife started to walk to the guy in the chair in a seductive manner, danced sensually around him, **AND THEN OPENED HIS LEGS AND SAT ON HIS LAP.** She continued to give this guy a sensual lap danced, as people around cheered, screamed, and roared. She seemingly kissed him from his neck all the way to his face.

What happened next made me tear up and hold on to my chest in real, physical pain.

She removed her breast pads and threw it out. and she grabbed the hands of this dude and placed it inside her top, and she moved the guy's hands to fondle her breast.

At this moment, I was not able to control myself. I threw the phone so hard, it hit the wooden pillar of our stars with a loud bang. The phone literally broke in half. The bang was so loud one might mistake it for a gunshot.

And I just collapsed there holding my head, crying.

After a minute of maybe an hour (I already don't know at this point), our bedroom door opened and I heard footsteps approach. There was a pause. Perhaps she saw trhe dent on the stair, her broken phone, me cryiing, and was able to at least out the pieces together. I heard her voice, breaking:

""I...I can explain. I--""

""Leave.""

Silence.

I repated myself. ""Leave. Lumayas ka na.""

""Mahal naman--""

I erupted this time, and screamed at her.

WAG

MO

AKONG

MATAWAG TAWAG

NA

MAHAL

With a gasp, I screamed louder:

LAYAS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

She didn't move.

""Lalayas ka o ako mismo kakaladkad sa iyo?""

She didn't move an inch.

I pulled her by her hadn and this was when she started screaming. ""Ano ba taman na sinsasktan mo ako!""

""Hindi kita sinsaktan, pinapalayas kita.""

I pushed her out and locked her out. I went to our bedroom and there, I just let go. I went on a rampage, screaming, throwing things, destroying things, ripping clothes apart. I don't know how long I went with it before I got tired. I opened my phone and contacted some people.

I think I fell asleep crying or just *tulala*. When I woke up, Anna somehow found her way in and was sitting in the corner, looking at me, sobbing. I stood up, and she attempted to stop me by grabbing my leg, but I just shut the door in her face.

I grabbed my phone, my wallet, and my phone charger. I went out and my friend, who I contacted last night, was already waiting for me. I gave him a quick run-through of what happened and asked him to bring me to somewhere far, like Baguio or La Union. I also contacted my parents, where we left our baby for the meantime, to go out and do not accept calls from Anna no matter what. of course I told them what happened.

It has been two days since I left. I am staying in some transient here in Baguio and I bought some clothes and personal hygiene items. I don't know what to do. I am always checking in with my folks and my baby, and according to them, Anna has been calling and sending chats all day. I also hid my main SIM card and is using a temporary number for now. I uninstalled all my social media and messaging apps except Telegram, where I made a new account and talk and do video call with my parents.

To be honest, I don't know what would happen next at this point. I have no problem with money as I have multiple credit cards and a debit card.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/zh7j6t/my_wife_kissed_someone_and_gave_a_lap_dance_to/,t2_uvduq61v,2022-12-10 04:18:19,586
Life has been better since leaving the NSFW community,"I said goodbye to the NSFW Reddit community long ago, and I must say, life has been more quiet and peaceful. I was into finding hookups, posting on my NSFW account pictures and videos, and loving the attention and exhibitionist aspect of hearing and watching me at my most vulnerable state. And in all honesty, I enjoyed exploring my sexuality & connecting with people of the same mindset about sex. But it was also mentally, socially, and physically draining. I’m sure it’s not like this for all people who are able to separate such things in their lives, but it was different with me. I yearned for that intimacy & I knew I was looking at the wrong place for that. Not to mention that the NSFW subreddits can get quite toxic—romanticizing kinks to real life non-consensual shit, the harassment I get, the insults I receive, the threats about my identity, when I did all that crap for free! No wonder we lost so many good redditors in the community. I get why they all left and never turned back. 

So, goodbye to that alternate persona. I used you as a means to escape what I should’ve faced long ago. It was fun, I met great people, but right now, it’s time to meet myself for who I am.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1anx0mp/life_has_been_better_since_leaving_the_nsfw/,t2_t7v4tnyoh,2024-02-11 10:16:07,482

Now sahod na sana this 15, pero he's threatening to hold my salary if hindi ko ginawa mga gusto niya (makipagkita sa kanya, flirt back, send explicit photos etc) Sobrang naiipit ako kasi gagamitin ko sana yung sahod pang bayad sa review center, i'm planning to take the board exams this August.Yung review mag-sstart na this April. I really need an income right now. Balak ko sana kunin lang sahod this month tapos mag-resign na, pero bina-blackmail naman ako na hindi ibibigay.

"Looks aren’t “everthing” BUT in day-to-day life, it sorta is.","Your personality and confidence can only shine through time. When it comes to first impressions, such as job interviews, you won’t have time to explain how good your personality is or how interesting your hobbies are.

Alam mo yung mga magaganda at gwapo na obob pero center of attention and recipient of kindness parin? Even though their ugali may be average or mas pangit pa kesa average? Yeah.

Remember the girl na nagviral kasi pinatay yata nya yung family nya or some shit, and people were quick to defend her whereas convicted people na average looks e guilty agad? Yeah.

I also remember this skit by SNL, where the punchline is, “the difference between sexual harassment and sexy flirting is how attractive the perpetrator is”, it rings so fucking true. https://youtu.be/PxuUkYiaUc8

Buti pa ang mga lalaki di kailangan mag-alala kung anong mangyayari sa kanila habang nasa labas,"di nila kailangan mag-alala kung masyadong late na o delikado para maglakad o magcommute mag-isa. di nila kailangan mag-alala kung kailangan ba nila ng kasama para safe sila tuwing lalabas sila. di nila kailangan magalala tuwing naglalakad sila sa daan at magisip na baka sinusundan sila ng taong nasa likuran nila. di nila kailangan magalala tuwing may bibilhing panandalian sa gitna ng gabi at kayang-kaya nilang maglakad sa madilim na daan. di nila kailangan mag-alala na baka may sumipol at mangcatcall sa kanila na grupo ng mga kalalakihan tuwing lalabas sila.

wala lang, swerte niyo. Alam kong may mga kaso na harassment at sexual assault rin na nangyayari sa mga lalaki pero nakakaabala lang kasing isipin na inaalalahanin ko pa to. Hindi pa nga ko adult pero tuwing lumalabas ako nakatatak sa isip ko ang mga bagay na dapat gawin para maprotektahan ang sarili.

Sabi nga ng social sciences teacher ko sa SHS, manyak talaga ang mga lalaki, pag nakakakita ng legs o kahit anong revealing, pagnanasaan ka niya. Kaya dapat raw magsuot kaming mga babae ng covered.

Buti pa kayo.

My social sciene teacher was a messed up guy who said problematic things to us during class, ofc i dont agree with him, but it's people like him that make me feel sick to my stomach whenever i have intentions to even go outside for the littlest things. Siya yung tipo ng lalaki na tinutukoy kong kinatatakutan ng karamihan, hindi literal na lahat ng lalaki. Apologies for saying it like that, should've clarified some things first.

""but not all men-"" i know that, but i wouldn't make this post if a \*majority\* of men weren't the ones going after women and even other men. I'd have kept my fingers to myself and not have the thought to type this if it weren't so relevant.

Hindi niyo ba naiisip na, kung sino pa yung kadalasang biktima, sila pa yung mag-aadjust(ie. self-defense weapons and tips)? Imbes na turuan ang karamihan ng mga kalalakihan na huwag umatake ng iba at maging disenteng tao??!!???

Bodyshaming vs Preference,"Had a friend's friend confess to me recently. She asked if I would go out with her, I politely and shyly declined and she asked why. Ayoko ibigay reason ko cuz it might offend her, pero she insisted. I answered she's not my type and apologized. She asked again ano ba type ko. Told her I like tall and slim women. She said ok, then we parted ways. Next day, I heard from my friend that she said exis na raw ako kasi f*t shamer daw. Wth??! Some of our mutuals asked me about it too ""Sabi ni ano shiname mo raw sya?"" Got really annoyed with that. I told them all straight with what happened and even drew comparisons para lang malinis name ko. I said if I wasn't taller than her or if di ako Chinito (she only dates foreigners) she wouldn't like me too. And that me preferring women whom are tall, slim, maputi, financially stable etc is just the same as her setting her own preferences and standards.

Bodyshaming is when you harass or discriminate someone cuz of their body, but when it comes to sexual or romantic aspects, people are ALLOWED to reject people based on their own PREFERENCES. Girls turn down guys for their looks or height, why can't guys do the same? It's MY preference. MY choice.

Nakakaasar lang na some people feel entitled to someone else's admiration or feelings. Being rejected in a workplace or community for one's race, social status, weight, etc is discrimination and is illegal, but romantically and sexually? That doesn't apply. For the people out there na di comfy magturn down due to sensitive reasons such as looks, weight, etc. Please know it's not immoral or illegal to do so AS LONG as you do it politely and respectfully. It only becomes improper if borderline insult na, pero if it's you just enforcing your freedom of choice, it's not.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/11al7yi/bodyshaming_vs_preference/,t2_pb234651,2023-02-24 15:09:46,489
I felt violated,"I am a member of the LGBTQ community and I identify as bisexual. I just had this awful experience nung nag-CR ako sa isa mga malalaking terminal diyan sa South. The CR was full and kailangan mo pang pumila para makaihi. I went to the next urinal once it became available. While I was peeing, I saw in my peripheral vision that the guy beside me was taking a peek at my dick while trying to play with his own. It was done not in a discreet manner but in such an obvious way. I felt fucking disgusted like in broad daylight talaga, in a public space full of people where everybody can scrutinize what someone is doing. I also realized that the effin’ divider is too low that anyone who’s taller than you can take a peek sa weiner mo. He was an old man probably in his 50s and that’s what made it all the more revolting. He probably was so deprived of sex that he couldn’t think of other ways to release. I don’t want to generalize but I know cruising (with consent) is very rampant sa community but damn, have some decency when you’re in public. Sa boyfriend ko, kung mabasa mo ‘to dito, you know what I felt nung kinuwento ko sayo ‘to so thanks for listening. Not everybody is into that kink, folks. Jeez. Also, I felt more empathy sa mga victims ng sexual harassment lalong lalo na sa mga babae because it really isn’t easy to react real time.

I was having my lunchbreak in a coffee shop. Sobrang tuwa ko pa kasi kasama ko yung sonny angel ko and nagpipicture ako. Literally pipo pipo song inspired playlist yung tumutugtog.

Then I opened Twitter, and ‘yang balitang ‘yan yung bumungad sa akin. Natrigger pa ako lalo nung nabasa ko yung word na “paulit-ulit”.

My insides turned; I couldn’t think, and I couldn’t breathe. I was dumbfounded. If I wasn’t sitting down I probably would have dropped on the floor.

I'm a straight man and a gay kissed me,"TW: Sexual Harassment

So I was at a party. To cut things short, I was wasted as hell and was taken to my home by my friend's gay friend. 

I was drunk not stupid that night and I was still aware but barely had the mobility. 

During the night I felt a lip touch my upper lip and I immediately realized he kissed me so I shoved him away and called my sister who was in the next room for help and she picked me up. 

I told him to go home but he had the audacity to insist to stay at my place but I insisted he go home so he did because I was scared what he might do next. 

I woke up tired and looked at the mirror. My sister asked why was there blood in my mouth, I checked the mirror and felt it and realized it was lipgloss and lipstick. I felt sick to my stomach realizing and remembering what happened. 

I've never realized that this is how trauma and sexual harassment felt like. No matter how many times I washed and wiped my lip, I can still feel the linger of lipgloss on it as if I can't remove the oily based texture. 

I told my best friend about this and he was saddened about what happened. I also told my friend who was the gay's friend about what happened and they should be careful. 

I chatted him about it and he was passive as hell. Disgusting human being and it was no use to rant about it to him because he was very insincere. 

I know it's just a kiss, a peck if you will but I honestly feel disgusting and find myself washing my lip every often to rid the ghostly linger of that oil based lipgloss. 

I feel hurt how this has happened to me and it shows how disgusting people can be. I mean I've taken care of many drunk girls who throw themselves at me at bars and I don't like kissing them when they're wasted cuz I feel sorry for them. Plus they smell like barf 🤮.

I was groped by a male teacher when I was 9 years old.,"I (M) experienced sexual harassment at 9 years old by a male teacher at the study area of my old school. It happened in front of his students and they all thought it was funny but I froze up. 

Since that day I felt very different, kinda “hypersexed” perhaps. Never forgot the incident but didn’t realize the full extent of the trauma it caused me until I was in my early 20s. 

The desire to find this teacher and pop bullets in his head until he falls to the ground and be left unrecognizable in his fucking casket never left me since the realization; I’ve had fantasies of ending his life in front of his family. I know this is something I should process in therapy but I’m just too far gone and have been way too angry at this point; I’ve had therapy for unrelated reasons but this was never addressed.

About the teacher: he is a known pervert and would tell stories of his perversion to his students. Has a wife and kids and it’s so fucking gut-wrenching thinking of what he could have done to them or many others. He’s still teaching today. I hope I never see him ever again, otherwise I might end up spending the rest of my life incarcerated.

Awra situation is so triggering,"From a perspective of being sexually assaulted, multiple times. Seeing comments and judgements abt the situation is so triggering, and makes me feel unsafe, too much anger and anxiety.

I keep seeing people doubting, kinekwestyon yung kaibigan ni Awra na hinupuan, bakit daw hindi mag sampa ng kaso, bakit daw nananahimik. Bilang biktima, sobrang nakakatrigger yung mas may judgement pa sayo kaysa sa offender. Mas kinekwestyon ka pa, kung legit ba, na makakasira ka ng buhay ng iba; kaysa isipin paano naman kaming mga binastos, paano naman yung buhay namin, mental health namin, safety namin. Pag nabastos ka, di mo naman alam agad anong gagawain, anong sasabihin, anong reaction mo. Unang iisipin mo, “ay hindi naman siguro nya sinadya” o kaya “baka kasalanan ko din”, “di naman ganon kalala, nahawakan lang naman ako sa dibdib”. Dina-doubt mo na sarili mo, tapos makakakita ka pa na ikaw yung hinihusgahan, ikaw yung ginigisa, ikaw yung pinagppyestahan; bakit di ka magfile ng kaso, bakit di ka mag step forward bakit di ka magsalita. Alam nyo ba gaano kahirap magsumbong pag ganyang puro “hala sinungaling” nakikita mo. Sana yung concern na “masisira yung buhay ni kuya”, pareho din ng level sa concern sa mga binastos.

For Awra and the whole incident, naniniwala na pinagtanggol nya yung mga kaibigan nyang nabastos. Yung itsura nya sa vid na naghahabol e hindi itsura ng offended dahil nireject, yung gawain na mag habol at manakit kapag nirereject e gawain (mostly) ng mga straight men, kapag queer ka o lgbt (esp judging from Awra, di naman siguro sya mag aamok sa public place lalo’t public figure sya, sikat sya, magkakalat ka ba dahil lang sa tite) — pag parte ka ng lgbt, alam mong prone ka na magpagkaisahan. So I honestly believe na yung galit na nafefeel nya ay hindi dahil sa nareject sya. — by that, I appreciate that she stood up for her friends, she fought for them.

Yung nagleak na cctv footage, parang yung guy minamock sina Awra at jinojoke na ibababa nya pants nya. and if Awra did try to make a move, (not excusing harassment) its probably to make the guy feel what it feels like na manyakin, giving the energy back to him.

Anyway, this mightve been too long. Sobrang nakakatrigger lang, I was hoping na when i jump in reddit i see comforting opinions,, but it was the other way. Idk, believe what you want to, but victims and girls who had been assaulted, I know we appreciate and thank Awra for defending and speaking up against sexual harassment.

as someone na ilang beses na naka-experience ng sexual harassment mula pagkabata, i know how it feels to be invalidated at hindi kampihan. hindi maganda sa pakiramdam so i felt the need to stand up for them kasi mismo nanay nila, pinagmukha pa silang masama. sa dalawang babae naman na rin galing na ayaw nilang gumanti sa bunso nila kasi at the end ay sila rin ang mapapagalitan.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/186vmyk/batang_nanghihipo/,t2_or3g62pr,2023-11-30 01:57:18,7

Every time I post on subreddits tulad ng phr4r or phr4friends, kahit na may mahabang disclaimer ako na hindi na ako for hookups, I will get those requests from women na nakaclose ko na for some time. We would often video call and meet wholesomely pero darating talaga ang isang araw na they will pop the question.

I understand everyone has needs, but I'm not the right man to fulfill your sexual needs. I miss the person/s, kada aalis ako it feels like a breakup.

They're aware of it naman. I'm not sexual to them or anything naman. I just don't understand why this is happening. I can't imagine the horrors women go through everyday kasi it's a fact na women are sexually harassed madalas kumpara sa guys. People (men and women) with manyakol mindset (usually nasa mid-30s) say things na ""hindi ka kasi tunay na lalaki"", ""hindi ka kasi barako"", and ""swerte ka na nga, tinanggihan mo pa"". Is this an example of a double standard? Men get sexually harassed too! Hindi lang nila magets, and that hurts. I'm very manly in person daw sabi ng mga kakilala ko and I want to look less manly and approachable kaya recently I started to wear golf attire. I can provide pics nung before and after.

When I say no to their requests (either hookup or relasyon), some of it understand and apologize. Most get mad. I don't understand. After I say no, they'll hurl a lot of hurtful messages to me and it hurts me a lot and I will feel like shit for the rest of the day. This is another thing na most women go through kasi madalas nga guys ganito tapos women will reject them, then daming sasabihin nung guys na masasakit, how do you deal with them?

I may not be a woman pero I'm starting to get a glimpse of what sexual harassment women go through everyday.

Someone even said to me after ko tumanggi, na feeling malinis at perpekto daw ako, eh nakikipaghookup naman daw ako dati. Hindi ako feeling malinis at perpekto, it's just I'VE CHANGED and I WAS LOST AND BROKEN BEFORE kaya I did those things. I will never forget those hurtful words she said. Sana makalimutan ko na.

Sorry guys kung dito ko nauunload trauma ko. Wala akong mapagsabihan. May mga friends akong babae pero dun sila papanig. I even know someone personally na 40s tapos she is cheating with her husband for a year na kasi wala daw ""dilig"", kaya hindi ko din maopen sa kanila ito. May anak siya na toddler. Cheating is wrong, sa mga nagdedefend ng cheating, magalit na kayo sakin, pero hindi ko babaguhin pananaw ko.

I am not being judgemental. I just say something similar to ""I understand that you have needs but I'm not the right person to fulfill those needs."" Their words hurt like hell talaga. Please, I need your advice. I really want to meet new people talaga.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/x8e6zh/i_need_your_opinion_on_handling_things_better/,t2_nyhc8urk,2022-09-08 03:33:20,11
I was harassed while admitted in the hospital.,"TW: Sexual harassment

Hi there, I'm a guy and I just need to get this off my chest. I was due for a scheduled operation at a private hospital in Manila (sounds like Mcdo) a couple of weeks ago. So I admitted myself late in the evening and went to my private room. There was this night-shift male nurse who went after me and met me. Now, I have nothing against gay men, I have dear friends and colleagues who are also gay. But this male nurse was very unprofessional and made me really uncomfortable.

While speaking to me, instead of saying my first name or at least ""sir"", he kept addressing me as ""daddy"". His tone of voice was flirtatious and he was looking at me differently which made me very uncomfortable. He slipped it at first probably trying to test the waters then when I ignored it he continuously called me that.

When he asked me to fill out papers he sat next to me at my hospital bed and was inappropriately touching my hand, arm, and leg. I could have said something but I already froze because of my anxiety. I was told by medical friends that personnel aren't allowed to sit on hospital beds.

When he was putting an IV on my hand, a colleague of his, a nursing assistant, was there and he was boasting about how he was sponsored by his boyfriend that's how he was able to finish college, and that they've been together for years, and how he likes moreno and tall guys while flirtatiously looking at me. All that talking made him not focus on what he was doing and after injecting the IV into my hand, blood started to squirt out and drip on the bed, I was just in shock. He apologized and again called me ""daddy"".

The last time he returned to my room that evening was when I requested to have the sheets changed because of all the blood. It took a while and he said that it was because he had to attend to the patient next door who had breast cancer and another patient down the hall who he was complaining about not being ""cooperative"". It's just disappointing how for his profession he would even tell me these private things about other people, all while calling me ""daddy"".

He eventually stopped and started being professional when my wife came and that's when he lied low a bit and started calling me sir.

Anyways, thanks for the read. It's been bugging me for weeks now. The wife has been helping me get through it though so it helps a lot.

Take care, people.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/16sxyx7/i_was_harassed_while_admitted_in_the_hospital/,t2_2d0rer6v,2023-09-27 03:50:55,227

Beware of this notorious cheater on ph subreddits,"Beware of this married pioneer cheater

Not just a one time cheater but continuously deceives girls to be in a relationship with him, sexting, phone sex and/or have sex with them, girls of all ages. Sometimes also offers money to get lucky. All of these while his wife is unaware of it all. 

The intention of this post is for girls to be aware of his modus and marital status. 

Let’s just call him Cong kasi he looks like the vlogger guy but with weaker chin. Cong has been victimizing women for years now. He doesn’t have the looks but he has a decent voice. That’s how he lures girls plus with expensive gifts. 

Cong has been active in an nsfw discord server, where he finds his victims. He’s also active on ph subreddits. He likes to give nitros to be likeable and gain a nice guy image. Cong also makes up stories about people or repeat what he’s heard about them in an effort to eliminate competition. He’s discreet with his moves when flirting as some of his close friends, who are mostly pioneers of ph subreddits, know that he’s committed but some also enable their friend. Because of his friends, he also can’t be reported or girls are intimidated to do so. (Kilala din niya yung mga inexpose na perverts, sexual harassers in public) 

One of his recent victims found out that he’s married, then he just left the server or in hiding til everything’s being accused against him dies down.

This is just a warning for those who thought that he’s being sincere with wanting to be in an exclusive relationship with you, takes advantage of you sexually and mentally, that he’s in an open relationship with his wife (not true) and/or he’s single.

Kaibigan parin ng officemates ko ang dating boss namin na natanggal dahil hinarass ako,"Natanggal sya last year dahil nireport ko sya sa HR for sexual harassment. Matagal na nyang ginagawa sakin at alam yon ng officemates ko dahil nakikita at naririnig nila. Matagal din akong tumahimik dahil inisip ko kakampihan sya ng HR dahil manager sya at baka ako pa ang matanggal. Pero isa sa officemates ko inencourage ako na magsumbong na dahil palala ng palala ang mga ginagawa nya. Dati verbal lang, mga pajoke pero bastos na comment at tanong, hanggang sa niyayaya na nya akong lumabas or ihatid ako sa bahay kahit may asawa sya at alam nya na may boyfriend ako.

Matagal ang investigation at paresign na ako dahil akala ko verbal warning lang ang gagawin sa kanya. Nagulat lahat kami nung tinanggal sya. 

Masaya ako sa naging result at tahimik na ang buhay ko ngayon. Pero minsan nalulungkot lang ako kapag naiisip ko na kahit alam ng officemafes ko kung ano ang ginawa ng dating boss namin sa akin, kaibigan parin nila sya. Pag Friday at may inuman sila, niyayaya parin nila. Kapag may events katulad ng kasal or birthday, iniinvite parin sya. Parang wala silang pakialam kahit alam nila kung ano ang ginawa nya sakin.

Old co-worker knows little boundaries and is a shit gf,"I used to have this friend, we used to work together. Last year, she’s pretty much told everyone at work (out loud) she doesn’t use protection because she only relies on the pull out method. She openly talks about her sex life to co-workers (out loud again) which leaves everyone extremely uncomfortable. She also pretty much kept flirting with a female co-worker saying how “juicy” her lips are and how round her bottom is, pretty much sexually harassed our co-worker even when she’s committed to someone else. I called her out on her behavior before but she refused to listen, so I stopped associating myself with them. Last I heard she’s jumping from one guy to another (apparently her relationships were overlapping) so she’s a cheater as well.

Iba yung pleasure kapag may kakilala akong couples na masasama at alam mong possible bad parents, tas di magkaanak due to infertility. I don't believe in God pero para siyang sign ng universe na ""No, you don't deserve one"". Madami kasi akong kakilalang masasamang ugali na mag asawa tas walang anak. 

Example ko nalang is yung tito at tita ng jowa ko. Yung tito niya, hinarass siya sexually, tas yung tita niya kinakampihan pa asawa niya. Ayun, baog yung tito niya na kesyo ""lasing lang"" daw. Ang satisfying sa part namin, isa siyang malaking buti nga sainyo di niyo deserve yan.

Isa pang example yung adoptive parents ng nanay ko.  Sexually harassed din siya nang ""tatay"" niya at pinagtanggol din ng ""nanay"" niya yung nangyari.

The trauma he gave me when I was 4 is still here.,"Yung kapitbahay naming lalaki (around 8 na ata sya nun or 7) nakasama ko sa kwarto ng bahay nila tapos magkausap mama ko tas yung lola nyang girlboss (typical malakas na lola na masungit pero mapagmahal) tapos tumitingin kami sa bintana tas tinuturo ko pa yung grasd tapos sabi ko pa mukhang airport (idk bakit ko sinabi yon eh ndi ko pa alam ang airport) tapos sinarado nya yung pinto, then kinuha nya yung extra tsupon ng kapatid nya at nag hubad sya ng shorts. Nilagay nya sa titi nya yung tsupon at Pinatry nya akong paluhurin (i did) tas pinapasubo nya, hindi ko magawa kasi naturuan ako ng nanay ko na wag ipakita kahit kanino or hawakan yung sa iba. Hindi ko maalala kung paano ako umalis, yung part lang na pumasok kami at pinaluhod nya lang ako. Pag uwi ko sinabi ko kay mama kasi hindi ko maintindihan ano yung pinapagawa nya and I'm a curious kid. Tapos i remember her texting si nanay (yung lola) tas parang kinabukasan parang pinapalo sya. Medyo nadissapoint lang ako na hindi rin makakasuhan kasi child on child sexual harassment sya.

Harassment,"It’s been a few years since I sexually harassed my used to be bestfriend. Throw stones at me all you want, I’ll let you. I deserve them. It’s been years but the guilt has never died down. I regret it everyday. It’s true what they say “nasa huli ang pagsisisi”. More than a decade of friendship wasted. Once, I attempted to unalive myself. I couldn’t take it anymore. Unfortunately my brother saw what I was about to do. My life since then was all downhill. Couldn’t focus sa studies, spent 8 years total in college (for a 4 year course). Di ko alam kung para saan tong sinusulat ko, pero nagising lang ako ulit na gusto ko mag unalive ulit. Hindi ko alam if letting go burden to or open letter na nagbabakasakali  na makita ng ex bestfriend ko. Sometimes grabe na talaga ang guilt. 
Pero if you’re here, reading this. Sorry again. Thank you for not pressing charges or telling your mom. Doon palang hiyang hiyang na ako magpakita ng mukha sayo. Tapos kinaya mo pang iinvite ako ulit sa bahay nyo kasi nag reunion highschool friends. Thank you. I hope you’re doing great.

some traumas that changed my life forever,"one of the reasons why i left FB a few years ago is that i was traumatized.

i was sexually harassed before and it affects my relationships then it made my self-esteem low. i used to be with an online community until someone mentioned that if someone touched you without your permission, you're molested. if you let them touch you then you let them abuse you. how can i tell that to my child psychiatrist when i was in high school? not a fam member needs to know about it except the part that i was almost groped by a maternal relative who is active in the church. it will never be the same again even during family reunions. disgusting.

i can't even wear a decent clothing that even r*pe, purity and modesty culture made it worse for me.

i did however managed to have sex with my old friend last year but the guilt, shame and pain won't help. i wanted to commit suicide again but i can't kasi nga may utang pala ako ganun din. i can go to the church but it won't be the same again unless somehow some people will avoid being a misogynist jerk.

nagpapaCBT techniques ako when i can't afford therapy kasi it's always help yourself daw 'di ba? eh parang yung analogy dito: https://youtube.com/shorts/kdiAEAqVnN8?si=uBGJTxrmZDamXHUV

kahit anong gawin mo pero may malaking buhol siya na hindi matagal ay wala. unless a simple worksheet can cover that up.

i became silent when i feel like these feelings are locking me up in a dark place. what's even worse someone shared to me earlier that a dark joke of commiting suicide for a deceased loved one shows that apathy and empathy is so different somehow.

you can't change my mind regarding of what i believe in. it's not your responsibility to fix someone who's damaged unless if you been there.

traumas are not meant to be shared but actually would other partners will care about it? hindi naman usually need i-share kung need mo na lang sabihin.

that sums up. i hope walang bigla magppm sa akin about dito.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1b10pc5/some_traumas_that_changed_my_life_forever/,t2_ak3l840d,2024-02-27 10:39:07,3
Out neighborhood is changing and I think it’s for the worse.,"I just want to vent out my frustrations sa negative changes na nangyayari sa neighborhood namin. Medyo mahaba to pero I hope you can bear with my litte story.

Yung family namin is considered one of the “pioneer” families sa isang barangay dito sa City of Manila. They were one of the first land owners nung panahon na “imbakan” pa lang ng certain crop yung lugar. Growing up, kahit hindi gated community yung area namin, it felt really safe and peaceful. yung tipong kahit lumabas ka ng madaling araw, alam mong walang gagawa sa iyo ng masama. Everyone knows everyone and very “bayanihan” ng community. 

Then panahon ni Atienza and Lim, nagkaroon ng “clean up operations” ng mga informal settlers around Manila. There was a settlement near a storage/factory facility na malapit sa barangay namin  and pinaalis mga tao doon. Eto din yung time na yung mga “pioneer” families sa area namin ay either tumatanda na or nag migrate to a different country or province. So nagkaroon ng surplus na cheap rental properties sa area namin considering na di naman prime location yung barangay namin. So maraming “new families” na nanggaling sa mga settlers ang nag move in sa neighborhood namin and doon nagsimula na “gumulo” ang neighborhood namin.

Tumaas bigla cases ng akyat bahay sa area namin and hindi din naging safe ang family namin. Nanakawan kami ng valuable jewelries and yung ancestral home ng mga lola ko nanakawan din ng mga priced possession. Umabot sa point na we have to install CCTVs sa bahay namin and barbwires. May time din na my fucking cousin who was 16 yrs old at that time, got catcalled and sexually harassed na nag end up na they were forced to move for a couple of years kasi na trauma yung pinsan ko. Umabot sa point na nagpapunta kami ng police kasi our “new neighbors” kept harassing my parents over some issues about yung boarder ng bahay na inuupahan nila na naglalabas ng itak. After that incident, no one tried to fight us sa neighborhood kasi well-connected family namin so isang tawag lang may reresponde agad na police (alam ko this is low na gumamit ng connections pero we have to given the circumstances) and i guess stories spread fast.

Then nagkaroon ng war on drugs si Duts and biglang nasama neighborhood namin sa watchlist which na prove na may shabu cartel sa amin and it turns out KATABING BAHAY PA NAMIN yung source. 

Fast forward na now im 28(M) and my parents are old now, I barely recognize the people in my neighborhood. Puro tambay na sa bawat kanto, puro inuman, puro kalat at tae ng aso na ang streets and drugs. I’m just sad kasi this place was my childhood and sobrang nababoy na siya. Maybe im sounding a bit elitist pero kahit sino naman siguro ganito mararamdaman if you are in the same situation.

P.S. yung mga lumaki na dito sa neighborhood na kasabayan ko/childhood friends are actually running for barangay positions kasi they dont want to lose hope and gusto nila ibalik yung dating neighborhood namin pero as for me, I’m planning to move away na if the opportunity arises.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1aln9qe/out_neighborhood_is_changing_and_i_think_its_for/,t2_3rxyjaqd,2024-02-08 12:28:52,3

“a careless mom’s careful daughter: finally moving out at 25”,"hi redditph! it’s my first time posting here but before i get this off my chest, i just wanna say i appreciate all of you here. (esp to those who get the TS reference!)

so, here goes. 

short bg, i’m 25F and the eldest daughter of a broken family. parents are separated but both already have their own partners now. i have 2 younger brothers, aged 23 and 16. 

i’ve only been working for 2+ months because i graduated at 24. i never stopped school, i just transferred schools due to 3 separate incidents involving sexual assault, sexual harassment from a prof and theft by fraud. 

why am i telling you this? because it’s part of the reason why i want to move out—my mother did not offer me support in circumstances like these wherein i needed the counsel of a parent. 

she didn’t believe i was sexually assaulted by a classmate. she instead screamed at me and asked me if i was drunk when it happened, what i was wearing, and if the guy who assaulted me was my boyfriend. (did not drink, was wearing my uniform and the guy was bi—he had a bf and all.) i reported it to my former uni but also to no avail.

she never did anything about my prof who continuously harassed me for 2 years. i explained to her countless times that he kept asking me out to dinner and drinks, just me and him. he also keeps inviting me to chat through secret conversations in messenger. i never budged so he failed me on one of his classes. i lost my chance to be a dean’s lister because of him. she just shrugged it off like it was nothing.

although, she did something to my classmate/dormmate who failed to pay her share for rent that she borrowed from us. she had her blottered at 2 barangays. 

these are just a few examples of the challenges i faced in life. since then, i’m sad to say, i had to go through worse stuff and my mother still wasn’t there even after i reached out. 

apart from that, there’s also the pathological lying, violent tendencies and deep unresolved anger issues. 

lately i just realized she constantly lies about our family. she had been telling people that she paid for my tuition even if my dad did. (he rightfully deserves the credit.) the worst one was one time we were together and someone asked if i was her daughter, she denied it. 

there’s also the violence i can’t take anymore. whenever she gets upset with us while driving, she goes into a road rage. she speeds through highways to get her point across. she throws things at us and somehow i always get the brunt of it. the worst one happened last year and i finally had the courage to record it (sound recording). it was clear in the audio that she was hitting me while i was telling her it hurts. 

in 2014, i was diagnosed with major depressive disorder during my parents’ initial break up. in 2020, i relapsed and (shamefully & regretfully) tried to take my own life. now i even developed severe anxiety and a slight eating disorder. i’m only 38kg at 5’2”. 

there are still nights when i feel too overwhelmed. but i never went to my mother again. i’m more scared of hearing what she’ll say than of hearing my own last breath. 

i know that i make mistakes, sometimes it’s really my fault why she’s mad. i’m not the perfect daughter. i already constantly beat myself up for it—without them needing to add to it. 

but i finally see now that i don’t have to be perfect to be loved and cared for. i don’t deserve to be hurt anymore.

right now, my simple wish is to start my healing journey, far away from her. to have my own safe space, to establish new boundaries and to have a place to finally start living after being on survival mode for so long. 

i worry about my brothers but after i asked them, they confirmed that she never hit them, unlike me. and they know enough not to depend on her for emotional support. 

one of my brothers will be graduating and working soon too. but i promised my youngest brother that they both have the option to live with me if they wish. i only survived because of them. i want to give them a better life. 

but the thing is, even if my mother has been a great burden to my emotional, mental and physical wellbeing, she is still my mother. i still want to move out with her approval and blessing. i still want to support her financially and maybe when time comes, even more than that. because maybe i’m not the only one who needs therapy. i want to help her. when she’s ready too. 

end of rant. hope you can hear me out.

Envy over everyone's lovelife,"Was it alright to get envious of everyone's lovelife around me? Seeing those Facebook stories of couples, the posts, basta everyone around me na may boyfriend or girlfriend.

I (20F) had my first MU in my SHS days (16yo), was sexually harassed while sleeping, felt shit over the years. It happened that I have a friend that can do 'hula' of my future. Because of brokenheartedness, I gave it a try. She told me ""may darating... plano ka niya"" that time. And as an explorer around Facebo0k, I lurked myself in RPW (people call us posers). There's this one guy (18 by 2021, CE student) that approached me and in short, he wooed me, we fell in love, he left. He said some things that he's been finding me for years (since we have communication through dreams but idk his identity, just a faceless man). It's been three years since we met but I feel like relapsing over this matter. I have a strong gut that he is the one who's being reffered to as 'plano ako' since he's the only guy I've been with in RPW (pls don't slap me with the golden rule). Since then, we have no communication. We only have communication on Viber (which is connected to my lost sim card). I am also furious by the fact na he can approach me naman sa Messenger since he knows my account. Why didn't he? Please help, I don't want to relapse over this shit over and over again. 

Also, I've been questioning God why he's not giving me my man yet? It's not I'm lonely but I am envious, really envious. Ang tagal tagal. Idk if I am being unreasonable or what, I don't want to meet other guys. I don't want to get to know anyone or start over sa potential romantic relationships. Siya lang gusto ko malala, and I know it's impossible but I am just maybe having high hopes na he's the one being reffered as ""plano ako"". 

PS. If you're reading this, please reach out to me. We've been ""engaged"" since April 2021 and you ran away. Idiot. 
PPS. We got ""married"" through Wed-on-Web by June 2021. 
PPPS. Advanced congrats since I know you're a graduating CE student around Manila. 💀

I just wanted to live...,"I don't know where to start. Sometimes, I wanted to live, but most of the time, I wanted to die.

I was raped when I was a kid, not only me but my sister also. I still remember the details. It keeps haunting me right now because I've been triggered by this recent sexual harassment I experienced. I have a hard time sleeping. I have had bad dreams lately.

&#x200B;

I was sexually harassed also when I was in Senior High, that was 6 years ago. I can still remember what he said to me. He said non-verbatim, ""You cannot ask for help once I rape you."" I froze, and I didn't do something about it, but I left my place. And I am still battling the trauma that he caused. 

&#x200B;

All these years, I am still battling with the trauma I got from the people who hurt me; from my father leaving me and my family; from my mother who blamed me why our father leave us; from my mother who physically abuse me when I was a kid to junior high; from my Lola who emotionally, mentally abused me; from my relatives who kept telling me that I should do better; from the teachers who labeled me as a lazy person despite being a consistent honor student and an active student doing extra-curricular activities; from the ""friends"" who I trusted the most but left me; and from my rapist.

&#x200B;

I am trying to be better, but still, I'm stuck with this cycle, feeling better later on, and then feeling like shit right after. It affected my work. Right this morning, I was scolded by my boss because I couldn't submit the task he gave me. It was 4 days overdue. He asked me to leave. I said sorry to him and told him that I won't do it again.

I have a hard time functioning, I cannot eat regularly, and sometimes, all I did is binge-watching anime or just watch cat videos, at least, to make me feel better. I love cats but I am afraid to get one on my own because I don't know how to take care of it. I just feed the strays around the area of my place. :)

And now, I am afraid to open up to the people I trusted. My boyfriend of 5 years told me that my episodes are annoying him and he doesn't want to deal with it. I want him to be, at least, be empathetic, but all I could hear from him was just himself, falling into depression also. He did this and that. I tried but it was still there. I opened up to my mother but she was afraid to break the peace within our family.

&#x200B;

All I could think right now is just to be gone. I am already drained. I'M LOST. I don't know what to do with my life anymore. Even money cannot make me feel alive. No one can make me feel alive. I want to find that purpose to live. I don't know where to start. I really wanted to save money for the therapy, but I tend to sabotage my work, so sometimes I only get a low commission.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/10igyjs/i_just_wanted_to_live/,t2_vnkgpto6,2023-01-22 18:48:06,4
I deserve to receive an apology and yet I can’t even feel any remorse from you.,"I’m gay and my officemate would often tell me to suck him and then pay him. At first tinatawanan ko lang pero nung sinasabi na nyang pati jowa ko gusto nyang tirahin medyo nababastusan na ako. I kept silent kasi nadiagnose sya with anxiety disorder and kapag inaatake sya dahil na call out sya, ako ang masama. So I kept my mouth shut. Pero nakakapagod din naman kasi.

Gusto ko ng reset button,"Lately kasi, nagresurface yung childhood trauma ko.

I was sexually harassed by an old neighbor and a cousin when I was still a kid. Magkahiwalay nangyari to. I don't even remember my exact age or which one happened first. Pero sure ako na hindi ako nagsumbong. Maybe my brother knows about the old perv neighbor pero bata parin siya nun so I doubt if he remembers. I can't tell anyone about it, not even my family. The old perv is long gone while my cousin is now living abroad with his wife and kids.

It's already too late to tell anyone pero I don't know how to get over it. I can't even get intimate with my long time BF ever since nagbalik yung trauma ko. That's when I told him. Napaka-understanding niya kaya siguro it added to my guilt.

So, lately I was constantly thinking of ending it. Like, planning how I'll do it without making it obvious na s*****e. I finally had the courage to get help and ayun na nga, I got diagnosed with depressive disorder with anxiety.

Ang unfair lang because the perpetrators already found their peace while I am still struggling. I want a reset button. Kung hindi ko man maiiwasan yung nangyari, at least maexpose ko man lang sila lalo na yung pinsan ko, bago siya nagka-anak.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/122i59w/gusto_ko_ng_reset_button/,t2_vnmhf1xm,2023-03-26 18:30:50,12
How I ruined my Ex's life for Getting with my Best friend,"**\[LONG POST AHEAD\]**

&#x200B;

First of all, I already know maraming magagalit saakin, perhaps because masyadong harsh ang ginawa ko. TW lang sa mga mambabasa, this post will contain sexual harassment, physical abuse, and religious CULTS.

SO, my first ex boyfriend and I began dating noon high school pa, precisely 8th grade. We dated for almost 4 years until niloko niya ako sa best friend ko. I'll call her ""A"". Noong una, sobrang perfect ng relationship. He was my first boyfriend and akala ko my last. I would say very low maintenance ako that time, tipong kahit hindi niya ako binibigyan ng bulaklak during Anniversary namin or Valentines, presence niya was enough for me. Naintindihan ko rin ang situation niya since noong una palang sinabi na niya saakin ""mahirap lang kami"". This is because Typhoon Yolanda severely affected his family (he grew up in Tacloban ) financially and naghirap sila. Prior to the typhoon his family wasn't financially stable na rin. So mas lumala lang ang situation nila, tapos madami pa sila magkakapatid. This explains why kinailangan niya lumuwas sa Maynila at mag aral. Matalino ang ex ko, like no joke. I studied in a well known private school in Manila, perhaps the whole Philippines pa. So to be a scholar there was a big deal. He excelled in everything, ma-pa sports or academics, which explains why na in love ako sakanya. I didn't give a single F kung mahirap siya, I fell in love with his intelligence, passion and ambition for success.

Fast forward to my 12th year of HS (4 years later),  biglang nagiba ang ugali niya when he entered college (he was a year above my grade level so nauna siya mag kolehiyo.). I was so confused and frustrated kasi 3 years consistent ang princess treatment niya saakin. He got physically abusive to the extent na wala na sa lugar. Pinapahiya niya ako in public, tipong sisigawan ako sa harap ng maraming tao. The first time he abused me was when sinampal niya ako. And not like yung mahina na sampal, but yung tipong FULL FORCE na sampal. Imagine, I am a 5'2 female and he's a 5'8 male na slightly malaman ang physique -- not to mention main sport pa niya in HS was volleyball. Sa sobrang lakas ng sampal niya I fell to the ground and nagka pasa ako sa face for one week. For most girls, the first thing they would do is makipaghiwalay, diba? Kaso, t4nga ako that time. He apologized and comforted me after this incident and nagsinungaling ako sa parents ko na natamaan ako ng bola sa mukha during intrams. I let it go because he apologized profusely and nangako na it would never happen again. But of course, it DID happen again. Multiple times in fact. I was 18 years old at the time pa.

Months later, I received a long message from him, stating na gusto na niya mag ""repent"" sa mga ""sins"" niya saakin. Nakipag break siya saakin. He joined a church, which I later found out was a cult pala. Sa cult na ito may ""quota"" sila, like how many people they could recruit to their church. They would get praised pag na reach nila ito. Dinamay pa niya ako sa kulto niya aaaah! And as expected, it was a living hell. In this Church you were monitored most of the time, dating was prohibited without the approval of the pastors and you had to take an oath na kailangan mo ibigay ang life mo sa church (ang reasoning nila is because Jesus did the same for God). Despite being in the church though, patago kami gumagawa ng indecent acts. The slightest physical intimacy was ABSOLUTELY prohibited but ginagawa pa rin namin sa likod ng mga sisters/brothers/pastors. Not gonna lie, at some point I was genuinely committed to serving the Lord, but it was so difficult for me to stay ""holy"" when my ex would pressure me to do indecent acts with him. Sobrang hypocritical niya, yung ip-pressure niya ako makipag talik pero the next day he would be preaching about staying holy until marriage. Like what the F! And yes, technically break na nga kami but I thought wala lang yon because he still treated me like his girlfriend.

Bob0 kasi ako, akala ko kami pa. Kaso, he started showing interest kay ""A"" and completely disregarded me. He began pursuing ""A"". *For context*, ""A"" was my best friend sa church. She was sweet, intelligent and kind. My ex met ""A"" through me and naging bff din sila because they go to the same University apparently. When my ex began pursuing her yung money na hinihiram niya saakin (but hindi naman binabayaran) ginagastos niya kay ""A"" for flowers and gifts. The audacity. Although, habang nililigawan pa niya si ""A"" saakin pa rin siya pumupunta, perhaps because of the uncertainty. As a T4nga, hinayaan ko lang. I thought if I treated him better pipiliin niya ako. Umabot pa sa punto na  nagmakaawa ako na ako nalang. *Wa epek*. When pinayagan na siya ng pastors to pursue ""A"" he ghosted me completely and avoided me in Church. Sa harap ko pa siya nag ""Will you be my Girlfriend?"" kay ""A"" at a special Church event. P0ta!  After niya ako paasahin, gawing sugar mommy and Fbuddy????

**Ito na ang exciting part**, I had so many mix emotions like heartbreak, frustration and anger. Mostly anger. Because I felt used and manipulated. So, sinabi ko kay ""A"" everything, that we were doing indecent acts, na ginamit niya ako, na kami pa when we entered the church and LEFT the Church. When I left the Church I gave myself some time off and decided to forget everything nalang. UNTIL narinig ko na my ex completely twisted the story and pinagkalat sa Church na I was the one pressuring him (huh?). Sa sobrang nandilim ang paningin ko I decided plotting a plan how I could completely ruin his life. Since pilit nag mamabait other sisters/brothers ko sa Church I would frequently message them, acting all buddy buddy, pretending na I am completely oblivious sa mga pinagsasabi nila behind my back. Praise the Gods my OG akong friend sa church (who eventually left din) na chinismis saakin na my ex sexually harassed ""A"". Hinalikan siya ng walang consent ni ""A"" and also pressured her frequently to do indecent acts. Their relationship went downhill from their because nag sumbong si ""A"" sa pastors. HA! I put this information to good use and pinagkalat sa University niya of what he did to ME and ""A"" (without uncovering our names). I anonymously posted sa Freedom Wall ng University niya and name dropped him. Like, name, batch and course pa. I exposed how he was an abuser, predator and manipulator. Inexpose ko rin ang darkest secret niya, na nanonood siya ng child hentai (which is technically child p, diba?). Nahuli ko sa gallery niya na he had hentai vids and pics of sexualized versions of child anime characters (like yung mga white blood cells sa Cells at Work anime). Alam ko, na b0b0 ako for letting this slide, but he reasoned na they were just drawings. Huh? Anyways, when the post gained enough attention I deleted it to cover my tracks. A week later, my ex's friend (who eventually became my friend na rin) informed me na my ex was being completely alienated in campus hehe. Receiving dirty looks, anonymous threats, and getting bullied almost. A month later nagpost siya sa FB na he felt unsafe sa campus and had to drop out and needed financial support from his ""brothers and sisters"" in Church. I know ang sama, but sobrang saya ko when I read that post. The thought na I had ruined his reputation sa University niya, relationship and Church ... sensational.

Also, if you're thinking about his family, I also took care of it. I told them everything via messenger na ginawa niya saakin and they were on my side. Sabi saakin ng sis ng ex ko (close ko rin) binugbog ang  ex ko ng father niya when he came home for Christmas sa Tacloban for being ""kahihiyan"" and for ruining his future. THANKS TITO ILY!

&#x200B;

PS. Also, I know dapat I should have been the matured one and walked away nalang para walang gulo. Sabi nga nila, God forgives even the greatest sinners. Unfortunately, for my ex, hindi ako Diyos.

The day I stopped gaslighting myself.,"I'm a patient person, also an introvert, so I don't like conflicts. Even if I ordered carbonara but you gave me pesto instead, I'd still eat the pesto. Iniisip ko nalang I'm going to try some other food, not just the usuals.


At work, may mga intolerable and tolerable workmates ako. Of course sexual harassment is never ok. So di kasali yun sa mga pinagtatanggol ko sa isip/sarili ko. What I meant was mga workmates that are lowkey stabbing me at my back, the ones who are talking about me pag wala ako, at pasimpleng nang iinsulto in a form of joke. I usually brush it off kasi wala naman din ako magagawa. Sasakit lang ulo ko kaiisip.



My friends, okay naman sila. Kahit minsan may mga di napagkakasunduan. So far, wala pa naman akong natutunugan sa kanina na binabackstab ako, which is di naman kataka taka because I'm always generous and genuine to them. Sana wala nga talaga. Or kahit meron,  sana kayanin ko.



Family... tunay na mas malapot ang dugo kaysa tubig. Pero kung gaano kalapot, ganun din kalala yung po-ot. I'm the silent type, but observes everything in the family.  The more I observe, the more I want to isolate myself from them. It's never a secret na uso yung backstab sa family namin. Everyone backstabs one another, except me. I hate talking about other people. I don't like conflicts. Kahit ganon sila I still do my part, I still do my best. Palaging the best lang. Inisiip ko nga bakit pa or para saan pa, eh in the end of the day, they will eventually forget my good deeds and will still talk about me behind my back. Palagi kong sinasabi sa sarili ko na okay lang yun. Okay lang yun... Okay lang yun... Kahit di naman talaga okay. 


So bakit ko nga ba sinasabi ang mga 'to? Naisip ko lang na I've been holding the grudge for a long time. Nakakapagod din maging nice girl at maging understanding. For the 1st time in my life, ngayon ko lang minura sa isip ko, pinagsalitaan at pinag isipan ng masama yung isa kong katrabaho na mabait lang pag kausap ako. Pero binabackstab naman ako pag wala ako.

I wish people will understand,"As a kid growing up I was dismissed and deprived of a lot of things. Emotional and material things, I never blamed anyone not my parents, our social status or anyone in fact. I was the black sheep of the family. I was afraid of this a disappointing look of my family’s eyes. I lived at the shadow of my siblings. However people seemed to have taken it as an opportunity to take advantage of me. I was groomed by him. I never asked people to understand my situation but how come they don’t get how suffocating it feels when you can’t cut him off? I got sexually harassed and manipulated do I look I want him to stay sa buhay ko? If I ever had a choice to cut him off I would pero it’s so fucking hard when almost I everything I have came from him. He is also a family friend and I he also got some of nudes. Im so scared of the consequences of cutting him off pero how come people can’t understand the fear I feel for the past years?
Idk its so hard to win a war when you don’t know if you can even win it yk. Of course I want to cut him off of course I want to get rid off him pero there are things I have to consider yk. I just want some support until I get the chance to actually do it na pero bakit frustration and disappointment pa natatangap ko? Im alr frustrated enough na it lasted for years. Im alr disappointed at myself na even let this happened. Please Ik what to do, ik na I need to cut him off pero Im just an 18yr old guy who is just at the beginning of my adult life. Out of people why is the person whom I love gave me that feeling? Do I look like na I wanted everything to happen? I just wanted some emotional support yk…. Im still just a child…. I just wanted some support…",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/18hnqhe/i_wish_people_will_understand/,t2_aaz2ww8b,2023-12-14 02:37:44,1
I feel guilty of the things I should have not done.,"Early 20's and I'd be lying if the pressure of being single hasn't gotten the best of me. This lead to the previous months with me in omegle and bumble looking for people to explore my sexuality with (consensual) with people.

Awkward would describe the feeling of exploring this side of me, knowing the only experience I had was being sexually harassed where my coach in college took advantage of me, groomed me and leading to him sexually harassing me during a party many years ago. I was so drunk that time and I don't remember giving consent but that experience awakened my urge to touch myself a lot.

Moving back, the first set of people who I get the chance to converse with in omegle were nothing much, some didn't go anywhere and some were too kind/nice and I didn't proceed any further, of course while keeping in mind of consent and being subtle about it, until I met C.

C has more drive compared to me and she was the first to invite me into doing the deed while on video. It was my first time as well. We did it frequently, 3x maybe even more. More so, this lead to the two of us becoming online fubu's  for quite some time until one day - when I did not notice that C was not in a mood to do it (vocal tone change) and only realized when C chatted that C was was feeling uncomfortable during our call. I immediately stopped the dirty talks and apologized repeatedly to C. C sounded teary eyed and told me that I shouldn't worry too much about that and that it was okay because I apologized and that I recognize that I went overboard during the call.

This incident however made me incredibly guilty with myself, I know I am supposed to be a morally upright person and there are times where I could focus with my review, work, and even while playing. My inner self constantly reminds myself that I have become the very person who I hate and condemn the most, and there was no atonement to what I have done.

C did send me a message a couple of days ago asking if how I was doing but I just told C that I still felt disgusted with myself after what happened. C then told me that she missed talking with me and that there's not need to say sorry and that everything is okay. Honestly I can't chat her at this point knowing what I did and the constant reminder of my inner self of the kind of monster that I have become. I know there's no atonement to all that I've done but I wish I did not explore this side of me. I regret everything that happened for the past months.

I'm sorry.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/sih463/i_feel_guilty_of_the_things_i_should_have_not_done/,t2_j9lvprsy,2022-02-02 13:59:27,4
I guess some things never change,"You've been slapping the hell out of me as a discipline and punishment like old-fashioned yet deeply trouble adults. 

Lo and behold you are surprised that I also beat my lil sis? Though I stopped at the age of 18 (24 now). 

And when was the last time you beat me up again? 2 years ago, at the start of the pandemic, at that time I wanna go out and work my ass off when you forbid it because COVID you could've talk me out of it. Like what you said to me a lot of times... MAY BIBIG KA DBA!?

Now ikaw ung nagpa-rapid test sa akin (unfortunately not FDA approved) may sakit na nga ako tapos nagawa mo pang SAPAKIN ANG BABA KO?!?! In order for me to hurry the fuck up?! I ain't crying cuz of the annoying ass short pain, I'm crying cuz YOU NEVER CHANGE! 

I DON'T FEEL LOVE FOR YOU, MOTHER

IN FACT, I FUCKING HATE YOU! I HATE YOU! I. FUCKING. HATE. YOU. 

I wanna migrate the fuck out of this god forsaken country, but I can't do that if I have TO WASTE MY LIFE BY SLEEPING UNDER THE SAME ROOF WITH YOU. 

I don't wanna have kids not just because of money, but because of what you did to me! I don't want kids to experience the pain that I feel ALL FOR THE SAKE OF DISCIPLINE AND PUNISHMENT. 

AND YOU'RE SURPRISED AT HOW I NONCHANTLY SAY SOMETHING SO VIOLENT AND DEADLY TO SOME DUDE WHO SEXUALLY HARASSES ME?! WONDER WHERE THE FUCK I GOT IT FROM?! (Aside from sexism, guess what? That's also your fault, mother)

ALL THOSE FRUSTRATIONS, MY LOVE AND LINES OF VIOLENCE AGAINST MY WOULD-BE ATTACKERS OR MEN WHO WILL SEXUALLY HARASS ME... WELL LET ME BE!

i feel so uncomfortable pero okay lang kay mama,"Edit: wag po sanang makaabot sa ibang social media platforms. Baka po makita ng nanay ko ahaha

I'm a minor. 

Last year, mayroong store na nagbebenta ng cellphone malapit sa bahay namin. Nasira ’yung charger ni mama kaya naisipan niyang bumili roon sa store na ’yun ng charger. Sumama ako kasi saturday naman ’yun and wala naman akong kahit na anong school works na kailangan gawin. 

Nanunuod lang ako sa Tiktok nung pumipili si mama ng charger tapos biglang nagtanong ’yung tindero na “May ate ba ’yan siya?” na sinagot naman ni mama na “Wala, only child ’yan.” tapos nagtanong ulit yung tindero na “Baka naman pwedeng pahingi ng number niya hahaha” and sobrang na-off talaga ako roon. Tumawa si mama tapos sabi niya, “Bata pa ’yan sya, 14 pa lang yan” pero this ugly piece of shit insisted na ayos lang daw kasi “bata” rin naman daw siya. Sinong niloko mo eh halos kaedaran mo na magulang ko? I feel so uncomfortable kaya inirapan ko lang siya. Nanginginig at naiiyak na rin ako noon kasi sobrang nababastusan talaga ako. Pag-uwi namin, ako pa pinagalitan ni mama kasi bakit daw sobrang pikon ko at bakit daw hindi ko kayang tumanggap ng isang joke? I told her na hindi naman kami close para magjoke ng ganun...  Ako pa ang bastos kasi nagwalk-out ako. 

Ngayong month din, nakaranas ulit ako ng ganun pero sa co-worker naman ng mama ko. Hindi ko alam kung anong mararamdaman ko nung time na yun kaya lumayo-layo ako nang kaunti sa pwesto nila Mama at nung co-worker niya. Inaasar pa ako nung co-worker ni mama by calling me ""Misis” and calling my mom “Tita”. Tumawa lang si Mama. 

Nag-away kami sa bahay ni mama dahil doon. Sabi ni mama, biro lang naman daw kaya sinagot ko sya na “Eh close ba kami para magbiro sya nang ganun? Wala ba syang mahanap na kaedaran niya para magsabi siya sa akin nang ganun?” pero nagtuloy-tuloy lang si Mama hanggang sa mapunta na naman sa “Pag namatay ako...” yung usapan. 

Kanina lang, nung dumaan ako sa tapat ng store niya, nilapitan niya ako then nagsabi siya sa akin, “baka pwede na ngayon?” natakot ako sobra pero gusto ko rin siya suntukin. Ang dugyot ng titig niya sa akin. Sinabi ko kay mama yung tungkol sa nangyari at pinakiusapan ko rin si mama na kung pwede, sitahin niya yung tinderong yun kasi sobrang  natatakot ako para sa sarili ko. Pero walang pinagbago... Sinabihan ulit ako ni mama ng pikon kasi biro lang naman daw ’yun. “Bakit di ka pa sanay?” haha

I feel so disgusted with myself. Pakiramdam ko, ako ang mali. Dahil sa sinasabi ni mama, hindi ko alam kung valid ba tong nararamdaman ko o pikon lang talaga ako. Natatakot na rin ako makipag-usap sa mga mas matatanda sa akin kasi natatakot ako na baka masabihan ulit ako nang mga ganoon.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1ao4s65/i_feel_so_uncomfortable_pero_okay_lang_kay_mama/,t2_re1izaqn,2024-02-11 18:10:46,1
A Spiritual Journey this Holy Week,"TW: trauma due to physical and sexual abuse/rape

Happy Easter everyone!

I just want to share the blessed week I (he/him; Roman Catholic faithful) had with my girl (she is pansexual) Medyo wala na ang loob niya dati sa pananampalataya, dahil dati pakiramdam niya ang ""dumi-dumi"" niya para humarap kay Lord (definitely not because of her gender and identity, God loves everyone). Tapos puro na lang problema ang pinagdarasal niya dati. 

Pero this Holy Week, she went with me in our hometown to spend Semana Santa there. We watched and joined processions of images. We went to Visita Iglesia with my family. And she had her first Holy Communion with ne during the Easter Celebration. I was surprised with the last one since she accompanied me to mass numerous times and this is our second Holy Week already.

After the Easter Sunday Mass, she told me that it was her first time to receive the Eucharist since 2011. She then elaborated na naiisip niyang marumi siya dahil nag-engage kasi siya sa hookup, and emotionally and sexually abusive relationships in the past. She was raped more than once (esp. by her last girlfriend), harassed numerous times by people she was supposed to look up to. 

It was a rough road for her, pero eto na siya unti-unting pinapatawad ang sarili niya, pabalik sa pananampalataya kay Lord. Mahal na mahal ko siya at sobrang proud ako sa kanya. Sharing this to also raise awareness on the trauma brought about by abuse and harassment. In the case of my girlfriend, it was a decade of not seeing her worthy of love even of Christ himself.

Anuman ang paniniwala, mahalin niyo ng sagad ang mga karelasyon niyo lalo na kung may kasaysayan sila ng abusive relationships. Of course, I am also urging people to go to therapy or seek professional help of any kind since we also did that (btw, she is diagnosed with PTSD, BPD and Bipolar Disorder; I am diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder Type II). Love heals, just be patient and kind 😊.

Why I left Alas Juicy,"The title says it all. I left this group for my own good. It has affected my daily life and my academic responsibilities. This community has many perverted men (I'm not generalizing members of this group tho) and bullshit stories. I'm not in favour of the so-called Hoe Phase (in which people engage in hook-ups to make themselves feel ""empowered"") because I might get STDs and HIV from having multiple sexual partners despite using a condom. Condoms can still rip apart and STDs and HIV can be transmitted through skin-to-skin contact, kissing, oral sex, and bodily fluids. You can downvote me and call me a slut-shamer, misogynist, and boomer all you want but you should know that sexual health is important. I'd rather play with myself to relieve stress and relax whenever I feel horny as fuck than having sex with strangers which is unhealthy. This can also take a toll on mental health. I've read stories about people especially women who got over the hoe phase and they were not proud of it. They realized they were used and treated like an object. When I posted about myself being horny in this community, men have harassed me in the chat inbox. This post is now deleted. They would request me to show my fully nude body to them in Telegram and Chat Inbox but I repeatedly told them I'm not comfortable. They still didn't want to accept NO. I also sent a picture of my full body to them and this one Redditor told me that I should be careful because they might use my photos and spread everywhere. There are creeps who told me ""Ang sarap mong i-gang bang at abusuhin"" that are inappropriate and unacceptable. There was one guy who forced me to hook up with him and I said ""I'm sorry. I am very busy with school"" and he asked me another uncomfortable question ""Saan ba kita pwede sunduin?"". I should have said NO to him. I blocked all of them afterwards. 


A description about me: I'm 19 turning 20 this August. I'm a voluptuous woman which is considered attractive in the eyes of men (and queer women). I have a round body with curves. I have big butt and thick thighs. I'd rather give my body to my future spouse. I have a large body frame.

I'm openly bisexual and I have been attracted to both sexes. I have male classmates who had a crush on me because they found me attractive.

"Today is my 30th Birthday, I left my toxic environment but I am feeling shit","Hey. So today is my Birthday and I am supposed to feel great with what I achieved in life but I am just feeling empty. I grew up in a household with lost of struggles: physical abuse, neglect, finance struggles,...
I manage to finance my studies, I left my home, moved abroad and got a PhD in field I am super passionate about. I met someone incredible and we are super happy together. However all my family drama continues to make me feel empty...
I just discovered a few weeks ago that my brother-in-law has been abusing my little sister during 10 years. She was 14 years old when it all started and he has been controlling her since then. My brother-in-law has been accused of sexual harassment on minors and might go to prison. Both of my sister's are still trying to protect him because they want the kids to have a dad...
I struggle to feel joy certain days when I think how fucked up my sister's life are and how this will affect their kids. 

I would love to be able to help them but I also want to allow myself to feel joy which I deserve.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/pwexkk/today_is_my_30th_birthday_i_left_my_toxic/,t2_evh6g6rd,2021-09-27 19:19:41,13
Why do I feel closer with my abusers,"I was sexually harassed for 2-3 years (memory’s blurry) by my cousin. Ginagawa niya pag tulog ako. Nagsimula noong grade 7 palang ako, grad na ko ng college ngayon haha. He would touch my private parts and I’d feel him fapping beside me. Sometimes I’d feel his semen na tumalsik sa akin.

Akala ko nung una panaginip lang. Close kami eh. Kinupkop namin siya noong nag-aral siya sa Maynila. Mabait naman siya sa umaga. Kabonding ko sa mga banda at arts. Pero totoo pala. Hindi ko naman alam mararamdaman ko. 

Pero noong unang taon, sinabi ko sa kuya ko. Unang beses kong umiyak. Unang beses kong nagsumbong. Kaso wala siyang ginawa, hindi nga nagreact. Kinabukasan parang wala lang. Nakikipagbiruan lang ulit kami sa kanya.

Hindi lang isang beses akong nagsabi sa iba. Hindi ko kaya mag-isa eh. Di ko kayang magsabi. Sa tita ko, ate ko, pinsan ko, pati mga kaklase ko (oo, MGA), wala namang nangyari. 

Tinanggap ko na lang. Di ko na rin naman alam iisipin o gagawin. Dumating sa point na ayaw ko na lang na malaman niyang gising ako. Ang daming problema sa bahay, ayoko dumagdag. I was always a timid kid na takot magsalita, kahit sa ganong moment, hindi na lang ako makagalaw. Pinipikit ko na lang nang mariin mata ko. 

Isa pa, hinahawakan niya lang naman ako kako. Baka hindi grounds ito para sa reaksyon ko. Baka OA lang ako. Ang daming mas malala dyan eh, sa akin yun lang.

Hanggang sa umabot ng taon. Natigil na lang nung umuwi siya sa province nung 4th year na ko.

Ako ayun, sobrang depressed. Traumatized at sinisisi ang sarili kasi hindi ako nagsalita. Traumatized at hindi na kayang himingi ng tulong sa iba. Galit sa sarili kasi paano ako nakakatwa ksama yung hayop na yon? Galit sa sarili kasi kasalanan ko rin.

Ngayong medyo naghiheal na ako sa particular trauma na to, narirealize ko na ang tanga ko nga. Hindi na dapat ako humingi ng tulong o naghintay sagipin ng iba. Sana yung tapang ko ngayon meron ako kahit katiting noon.

Weird lang din. Pakiramdam ko andito yung trauma pero madalas wala na. Di ko naman siya pinatawad pero pakiramdam ko nakakalimot na ko. Bat ang bait ko pa rin don at bakit komportable akong makipagbiruan sa kanya? Ang weird. Pakiramdam ko hinihiwalay ko siya doon sa ginawa niya. Di niya naman deserve. Tangina ng mga manyak ha.

Note: hindi lang siya. Pati mga kapatid niya. Siya lang malala. Di ko alam kung sabwatan tong mga to kasi pare-parehas sila ng ginawa. Pero ang pamilya namin pinaka-close sa kanila putangina.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/ztqxvt/why_do_i_feel_closer_with_my_abusers/,t2_8hfeea1h,2022-12-24 03:50:59,61
most men in my life have failed me,"for context my dad wasn't around growing up kasi he had to leave abroad for work para makapag-provide sakin and i used to have a resentment for him when i was younger, but eventually i got to understand why he did what he had to do but his absence has lead me to a lot of fucked up things. wala akong father figure growing up, so wala din akong idea how a man should treat me. i was in highschool when i got raped and at that time, i didn't even realize it because it was a ""friend"" who did it. the guys i've been with cheated on me and even tried to slander me kahit wala akong ginawa kundi mahalin sila wholeheartedly. yung lolo ko (dad ni mom) may anger issues at alcoholic pa tas pinag-iinitan ako for the little things. my stepdad used to and still sexually harasses me. 

hindi ako misandrist pero putangina these keep giving me a reason to absolutely despise male attention and males in general. madaming matino na lalaki sa mundo pero katumbas din yung mga basura na tulad nila, and i always get the rotten batches. natatakot nako magjowa ng lalaki kasi baka katulad nila yung dadating sa buhay ko. natatakot nadin ako sa mga lalaki in person kasi lumala ptsd at trust issues ko kaya mas malapitin ako sa mga babae. 

hindi ko na alam kung paano ko ipo-process tong trauma nato and it's making me very suicidal na din.

bakit ganto mga lalaki sa buhay ko? ano ba ginawa ko sa kanila na ganto paningin nila saken? na parang wala akong silbi na pwede ako gaguhin at bastusin. tangina.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/xttlcf/most_men_in_my_life_have_failed_me/,t2_6eyx6c8o,2022-10-03 00:51:26,12
"Isipin mo nalang nanay, kapatid or anak mo narrative","Girlfriend was reading posts about multiple incidents of harassment sa motorcyle hailing platforms like Angkas and Joyride.

She was reading testimonies and comments of people who said, **""Para silang mga walang nanay, kapatid o anak na babae.""**

And just like that, literal na sabay uminit ulo namin! How messed up could it be that harassers need to be reminded pa about having female figures in their lives? Eh tangina, hindi naman conditional ang respeto na kelangan iremind ka muna na may nanay ka before you behave like a decent human being.

Regardless kung may nanay ka, kapatid or anak na babae, bare minimum lang na rumespeto ka sa lahat ng tao. Why do they need to be reminded pa? 

Sobrang gago mo na if you only sober up when you get reminded na, ""Ay fuck, may nanay or kapatid nga pala ako. Dapat di ko sinisexualize tong babaeng to."" Eh kamote kang gago ka kung kelangan mo pa ng ganyang reminder.

I hope people will stop romanticizing the narrative na, ""Magalang ako kase may nanay ako tsaka may mga kapatid akong babae."" Ulol. Bare minimum ang pag respeto at binibigay dapat yan sa lahat. Kung conditional ang pagbibigay mo ng respeto, don't ever categorize yourself to be even decent.

Isa pa yung sobrang basura na take na, ""Pasalamat ka nga, hindi ako sayo humihingi ng nudes. Normal lang sa amin yung maglike or mag-heart or magsave ng mga sexy pics and vid. At least hindi sayo hinihingi. Kase ginagalang kita.""

Ulol! Beware people. Because this stupid narrative is far from being respectful. It only goes to show na your partner is fine with sexualizing people. Na feeling nila, basta nagupload na ng picture online, consent na yun para isexualize yung mga OP ng picture.

Unlike trust that you should work hard for to earn, respect and basic human decency are bare minimum. Hindi conditional ang pagbibigay respeto at pagiging disente.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/13cjemp/isipin_mo_nalang_nanay_kapatid_or_anak_mo/,t2_e5fnnay0,2023-05-09 16:14:19,2

Nagvavlog daw kasi sya ng mga kwentuhan while rides. Nakakaturn off kasi sana nagiinform muna ng maayos kung gusto ko ba mapabilang sa mga ganyang bagay. Namimilit pa sya pagbaba ko na patingin daw fb ko add ko daw sya magchat chat daw kami. Nakakainis sobra.

TIFU by letting my Dad see a video of me masturbating,"Fucked up real bad. My dad gave me a new phone yesterday, and so I transferred lahat ng files, including my photos from my previous phone to the new one. Pero ginagamit ko pa rin yung luma since di ko pa naililipat yung sim card ko.

Just a while ago, inutusan ako ng dad ko na itext si mama. And since nasa luma pa yung sim ko, umalis muna ako sa table ko para kunin yung luma kong phone. Bale naiwan ko sa table ko yung bago kong phone. Thanks to my stupidity, naiwan kong nakaunlock yung new phone tapos kinuha ni dad yung phone para macheck yung graphic interface ng new phone.

Pagbalik ko, nagulat ako as I saw him looking at my gallery, and bungad na bungad sa thumbnail ng isang album yung vid ko na nagmamasturbate. Good thing is, wala dun yung mukha ko. To be fair, nakahide talaga yung video na yun sa luma kong phone, but nung natransfer na sa bago, hindi na nakahide. 

Now I'm feeling uncomfortable kasi I'm from a conservative family wherein sex is still considered taboo. Heck, they don't even know na I've already had hook ups. Same with masturbating. Hiyang hiya ako kasi what if isipin nya na it's my vid? My dad is a really good person talaga and luckily, I've never experienced getting sexually harassed by him pero what if he starts doing so now that there's this possibility na he already knows I'm doing such kind of stuff? Halo halo na nararamdaman ko hiya, takot.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/ttephl/tifu_by_letting_my_dad_see_a_video_of_me/,t2_ldpctp7a,2022-04-01 09:13:28,7
Emotionally unavailable parents,"Ang hirap pala pag wala ka na ngang tatay, emotionally unavailable pa nanay mo. I'm 16, and an only child, ngayon ko lang narealize na emotionally unavailable pala si mama. It all started around 5th grade siguro. Nalipat ako sa public school, surrounded with bad influences and sya naman, laging nasa work kaya weekends lang nakakauwi. That time, traumatized na ko when i make mistakes kasi ang gagawin is kukunin cellphone ko and sasaktan physically. I was lonely kasi nga i had no one to talk to who had an open mind. This took a toll on me kasi parang walang nag guide sakin lalo na pano i process ang complex emotions since this time was a crucial part sa personality development kasi nasa puberty ako non. Parang ako lang nag guide sa sarili ko without basic understanding on how to make right decisions and kung pano huwag pangunahan ng feelings mga gagawin ko. Na trauma ako mag open up kay mama kasi pag nagkakamali ako lagi nalang ako masasaktan emotionally and physically. Fast forward to present me, i had many curiosities. One of them was sex. You see, since bata pa ako i've felt lonely and nung na curious ako sa porn and sex, I got addicted. Maybe because of the dopamine spike or maybe because it was the only time i didn't feel lonely. I had a few friends with benefits and i liked it because di ko need maging tago sakanila, i can be vulnerable to them kumbaga. ""Maybe if u had sex i wont feel so lonely"" ""Maybe if i masturbate i wont feel so empty"" Ayan nasa utak ko and it worked; but not that long. Siguro after sex i felt lonely din agad pero di naman talaga sex cinacrave ko, it was the feeling na you can be free and vulnerable pag kasama mo sila and di mo need i force yung pagiging masaya. Ngayon, i messed up. Long story short naakusahan ako ng sexual harassment ng fwb ko bc nagpakita sya motive then nagsend ako ng nxdes and ayun uncomfy daw. Schoolmates kami and sinabi sa higher ups. Ngayon syempre punta si mama and now nalaman nya kung gano ako karumi. sabi nya it's too late para magbago and wala daw ako respeto sa babae. Nung day na yon i attempted suicide pero sayang di gumana. I want to get better pero pilit ako sinisira nung ex fwb ko kasi she keeps digging dirt saken and dito naman sa bahay emotionally unavailable talaga. idk what to do. i just wanna die so i can feel at ease",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/ztso2o/emotionally_unavailable_parents/,t2_r93hj3t0,2022-12-24 05:07:48,3
Nakakainis talaga maging babae,"In order to feel safe when I go out the house, kailangan ko magdala ng self defense items like pepper spray, stun gun, pocket knife, anti-rape whistle, etc. I took self defense classes and I admit, wala talaga akong upper body strength (jello arms)  since my instructor said na petite yung arms ko and he suggested to bulk up or so. Syempre kapag may nakita kang construction site or paradahan ng tricycle/jeep, di talaga maiiwasan may bastos so syempre, lalayo ka at mag iiba ng daan. That's my motivation to workout, gusto ko lumakas para walang maka overpower sakin if ever something bad happens. 

In order to not to hear catcalls or ""Hi ate!"", ""Good morning miss ganda"", ""San punta sexy?"" and other shit like that, I have to always go out with my earphones on blasting metal music in max volume. Been doing it for years since elementary school. Why? Because guys in passing would always say inappropriate things. I don't want to hear them, I don't need their ""compliments"", I don't want to answer them when they ask dumb questions like ""Miss anong oras na?"" kahit may phone naman sila when it's an obvious way to start a conversation with me. I really hate it. 

In order to avoid getting groped or ogled at, I should wear large clothes to hide my curves. I worked so hard to get an hourglass figure but I know damn well I can't ""flaunt"" it because someone out there thinks it's an invitation to harass me. I mostly wear huge black clothes and I got used to wearing a jacket/hoodie since high school because that's when my breasts started to develop. Kahit mainit, kayang tiisin basta wag lang maging prey ng mga predator na yan. At work and school, I have to wear skirts. I will wear stockings underneath so no skin will show pero syempre, sexualized parin yun. Can't catch a break, teh lol

In order to keep my peace of mind online, I deleted my personal social media accounts because of stalkers. One time, this guy saw my name sa ID ko, nakasabay ko lang sa jeep then he added and messaged me saying if he could be friends with me. Ulol. So I have my message request turned off. I watch out for things I join in, I don't trust strangers. I stopped wearing my ID in public, pagdating na lang talaga sa school. I don't accept messages from strangers. I don't even have something to say eh lol. I don't send pictures or info about myself to someone just because they're nice to me. Mahirap na. 

In order to not get taken advantage of, I have to have a resting bitch face. I have to look mean and unapproachable. I need to be a cold hearted person. Why? Because being kind is overrated. Be firm with your boundaries but someone will take it as a challenge even if you say no. Wala eh, ang hirap maging mabait kasi some guys see it as a romantic gesture. If you become friendly, they think you're too easy and naive. I don't exist for your pleasure. I stopped saying na I watch anime, I play video games and shit like that because I only attract guys who want a ""slim thicc big titty goth gf"" who fits their lifestyle. They like the idea of me, not me. They like what I am, not who I am.

Anyway, that's my soliloquy. I still do things for myself like dress up, put make up, do my hobbies, make sure I look decent, live my life. Ang hirap lang kasi I have to be extra cautious or else, ako rin ang talo sa dulo. On top of all the things like having periods, hormonal imbalance, work, studies, life in general lol, I don't know what the guy in front of me will do next if I become aggressive or kind. Is he a sore loser who can't handle rejection? Does he see women as disposable sex toys? Will he push my boundaries even if I say no? Am I gonna be assaulted if I walk near him? Ewan. Gusto ko na lang maging jellyfish.

PS. It's not a compliment to be harassed. ""Buti nga may nagkakagusto sayo"". Stop victim blaming. Work on your insecurities and have a better view of the world.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/vchhdu/nakakainis_talaga_maging_babae/,t2_8ubpep1n,2022-06-15 08:17:47,188
ni-“lang” ang assault,"The title says it all. “Past na yun. Kalimutan na lang pala?”

This story has many sides but I was just hurt the moment I was told to just move past and forget everything. For context, I have a friend who also happens to be a friend of the perpetrator, alyas JP.

JP was being attacked by his victim in a way that he was spreading the issue to the whole class. That he’s gay, nanghihikap, manyak, etc. Take note, JP and his victim were actually “bestfriends”, and the victim was just scared and didn’t know what to do about the incidents. (this is another story)

To your surprise, I am also a victim of JP. And since there were issues circulating around, the perpetrator felt ashamed and hurt. He’s hurt because “his bestfriend is going against him and spreading the issue”. Gago ka ba.

And my friend here was his guardian angel. She’s sympathizing with the perpetrator, na kesyo nagbago na daw siya, na nasasaktan na daw siya, na sobra na daw yung ginagawa ng bestfriend niya, na bakit pa daw kailangan umabot sa point na yun na kung pwede naman kalimutan na lang kasi past na.

Yes true, too much na yung idea na ipagkalat pa ang issue. But it’s just not like that. It’s just not about that. I expected you to be more understanding about the issue, that it IS a sexual assault, that someone has been harassed. You are my so-called bestfriend but where on earth did you get the guts to try to convince me to sweep everything under the rug just because you’ve seen them crying?

I really wish you wouldn’t get to experience what we experienced.

"I feel abused, used, and exploited. Now I feel disgusted with myself.","People always taking advantage of me because they knew I’m too vulnerable.

I was trying to give this freelance job a chance, therefore, I decided to go back in the office last Saturday as I was invited to work on a small project. 
When I got there, the architect always seems nice to me even before I started working for him on different projects. Although, I know deep down his real intention every time he invites me to work in his firm. I was being nice too that’s why I accepted the offer even though I was skeptical at first because my gut instinct tells me not to go and I know him and his desires. He’s been trying to message me for months, telling me that he considered me as his admin staff but I declined it that time because I know him. But this last Saturday, I came back in the office, I needed a job even if it doesn’t pay well and being targeted into having sex is possible, I accepted the job, not with the idea of having an hook-up that day. I just sat down there while asking him for more details about the coming projects when later on he forcedly kissed and pulled me in closer to him and it just happened because I was silently stopped asking him and that’s his queue to break the silence and make his move for first base. Even though it was wrong and it’s not the reason I have gone there in the first place, I just let him do that to me, I feel disgusted with myself because I just froze there like a statue- it’s like the feeling you’re being harassed by someone but you couldn’t barely move and your head is filled with intrusive thoughts. (That’s what it feels like when you’re being victimised of sexual harassment.) (Deep inside you’re like screaming so loud but it doesn’t make a sound.) When his sexual motions started to go further, there I told him to stop, and said to him, I did not like it and I saw the look on his face, how disappointed he was in that moment. The day and the job goes on like nothing happened. He asked me to come last Sunday, and I declined. But the coming day, I came in to do the job he asked me to do with the officemates. The latter days, I asked him thru chat if I should go to work last Thursday, however, I did not go then the next day, I still did not come because I feel abused, used, exploited, and so on. 

I feel emotionally, verbally, and almost physically abused by someone else also, and that’s just another story. 

I’m too vulnerable at the moment. 
I play online games just to get by with all the bs the world is giving me in the past months. 
That’s all.

“When I’m away from you, I’m happier than ever”.

I'm my own sugar daddy so happy father's day to me!,"My real father is shit in general so yeah.

Never got a job the moment he married my mom. Never provided for us. Never raised us properly. Never bothered to take care of us. We're just existing for him to have the title of ""husband"" and ""father"".

Always abusee my mom. Always made my younger brother his punching bag. Always sexually harassed me and my younger sister. Always sleeping, eating excessively, watching too much tv and shit on the internet, always complained about his life but never made it better.

Thanks for showing me the kind of person I never wanted to be. Thanks for being the blueprint of men that I need to avoid in my life. Thanks for existing to be a daily reminder that I have to work and study so hard so I can spoil my mom and my siblings someday. You can die in a ditch and I won't give a shit.

I'm at that point in my life wherein as the eldest, I want the absolute best for my siblings. For my mom, I can probably forgive her because she didn't actively choose a shitty person to marry and start a family with. I can provide for us while simultaneously making my father feel like shit because he is one. Oh well, I don't care.

If you have a truly loving and supportive father, damn, you're very lucky. If you never experienced your first heartbreak from your dad, you're so blessed to have him as a father. I hope all the fathers out there that put his family first above anything and anyone else know that you're the best in your own way.

I'll celebrate this day for me. For my late loving grandpa. For my hardworking mom. Not for my father, he can continue existing in his own cesspool of incompetence.

And now you’re confronting me about disrespecting you just because you think I was being rude that I offended you by telling you the truth regarding your work ideas when you rejected mine every damn time even after working hard for it, and you will then ask for an approval from other staff that I have never even met even once in the office. How dare you brushing off my workload efforts just to ask someone else, then how dare you invalidating my work effort, And How dare you talking to me about respect when you always disrespecting me when you pretend listening to my presentation. Do you even respect my time and effort that I’d put into it even the low salary that you give won’t be enough to take back the lost time. F-ck you for wasting all my time and effort. And how dare you talking and educating me about good character when you insulted me by making me feel like I wasn’t doing my task when you did not even tell me what specific role, job order, and task should I work on in the first place. Yes, i did not go to office yesterday just to think straight and also because I can’t take your bullshit. And f-ck you for asking where I was then saying you were concerned that I wasn’t there.

Btw, you can’t even give your employees a basic salary income, or even a raise when I asked for it last time. It’s so unfair to working in your company with that pile of workloads in a day, and seriously, your environment sucks. And f-ck you for wasting my time daily, boss.

I was jailed for 12 Hours,"This was happened last December 2022 pa but until now hinahaunt pa din ako. So, I'll be sharing it here baka it will help me cope with it. 

I was drunk that time, grabe yung pride ko kasi alam ko naman na may rights naman ako. But I was wrong, hindi pumanig ang tadhana sa'kin. I know what I am doing pero iba yung outcome ng nasa utak ko. So, I was jailed for 12 hours. When I woke up, I didn't know what to do kasi it's my first time being jailed. Umasa nalang ako sa napanood ko sa news na papalabasin ka rin naman eventually pero that's not the case pala. I asked the police on duty, he's quite arrogant at hindi ko gusto yung na way siya magsalita, tinawanan pa ako because of what happened to me. Buti nalang end na nang shift niya and yung pumalit sa kanya is mabait, so I asked him kung ano mangyayari sa'kin because may part-time work pa ako that time. Then sabi niya 12 hours daw ako dapat magstay dun from the time of detention. He added na, when no one file a case then I may go after 12 hours pero if meron, I need to process some stuffs pa. Then madelay yung paglabas ko. Hindi 'to alam ng friends and family ko until now only my co-workers. 

I was late sa work na, feeling tired and empty. Traumatized in short, hindi kasi talaga maganda ang place doon, super liit. Nakakabaliw sobraa kasi wala kang gagawin.  And that night I was sexually harassed pa, someone grab my hand to hand job him. I was intoxicated pa with alcohol that time, I was so weak. I am pulling my hand pero, malakas siya kaya kahit ayaw ko, hinayaan ko nalang. Hindi na rin ako nag sumbong when the police asked me if okay lang daw ba ako during my stay. I just want to go out and leave the fucking place. 

So, if you are reading this be safe and mind your own business. Don't drink alone or too much (if sa bahay okay lang), don't expose yourself din sa madaming tao. Hanggang ngayon, naalala ko pa rin yung experience but it serve as a lesson. Recovering from it is really difficult. I was just so lucky na, I have a strong heart. Siguro, if hindi I may commit suicide or barely recovering.

my family is so unfair and it’s making me depressed,"I just want to rant on here because to be honest I don’t have someone to vent these feelings with. Since the pandemic up until now, my family has been heavily relying on me with everything. They even forced me to have a job after graduating high schoo. Now I initially didn’t have a problem with this because I genuinely want to help them even though hindi na ako nakaproceed ng college. Like I said I was okay with it, but when I had a problem with my job because I was mistreated and sexually harassed by my coworkers for being trans, I quit. Now with my savings I tried going back to school but I also applied for a scholarship and I passed so I thought everything was going better. Fast forward now, the school year ended. We had another crisis and I had to stop school. I was thinking of getting a WFH job because I live in a small city and we barely have opportunities. It was not easy for me to find a remote job because I really don’t have the skills for it or maybe I have but it’s only limited so I was getting depressed. Now my mom is getting agitated kasi daw I didn’t find any opportunities and mind you I have to fund for my laptop that I was going to use. She kept guilt tripping me to earn more money even though I am contributing half the bills with my side hustles online and this maybe isnt that bad if I didn’t have a 24 year old brother who doesn’t do anything but play computer games on his pc 24/7 and doesn’t even help with chores or anything like that, verbally abusive pa to me and my mom, but the confusing thing was she kept defending him like he was angel even though he does nothing but abuse us and our resources. He’s also very demanding with the food and everything else but she kept defending him but gets mad at me for every little thing. I’m so sick of it and I don’t know what to do and I can’t escape them or else they’ll call me selfish or possibly disown me and I don’t have a family. It’s just so unfair lang cause she also defended my sister who got pregnant nung teenager palang siya and she was even spoiled cause we were at a good place financially at the time. Yet she acts like she’s also an angel even though my sister stole our appliances and lied about something to get money from my parents just to go to Siargao with her boyfriend and bragged about it on social media, but when she had a problem with her kidneys, my parents were so quick to sell our car and everything else but yes she didn’t do anything wrong and that she’s an angel. She’s 26 now and I’m thr youngest in the family (21). This is so mentally draining and to be honest I already attempted to off myself but I managed to stop. I just want others opinion about this and how can I make my situation better. I feel so lost and exhausted. It’s getting very painful. I might give up soon…I have nowhere to go and I can’t trust anyone",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/16e7wqf/my_family_is_so_unfair_and_its_making_me_depressed/,t2_vklkhq01,2023-09-09 23:02:10,2
Naiilang talaga ako... ewww..,"I have this girl officemate, magkakilala kami for more than 5 years now. I don't really consider us as close friends but we're friendly. Mejo naiilang na ko sa kanya kasi may gusto sya sakin. I'm gay and very effeminate kaya I find it awkward kapag nagiging touchy na sya sakin. 

I found out na she likes me kasi on multiple occasions before, she confessed to me 'jokingly', and would often parinig na she likes straight and gay guys nga daw. Then one time, we had this activity sa team where you can send a note to anyone, and she sent me one and dun na nga sya nag'confess ng malala. As a gay person, parang nandidiri talaga ako (for the lack of a better term) 😅.

Umiiwas na ko sa kanya now and can't even look at her kahit nagpapapansin sya pero may mga times talaga na di maiiwasan kasi sya mismo yung tatabi or sasabay kumain or umuwi. 

Wala lang.. na'post ko lang kasi I scheduled my RTO na hindi kami sabay pero pumasok sya today kahit di nya sked and tumabi na naman sakin. Nakabusangot na naman tuloy ako kahit Lunes na Lunes. Ang cute pa naman ng outfit ko today. 😅",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/107dvkn/naiilang_talaga_ako_ewww/,t2_qf4k2suw,2023-01-09 21:02:31,8
I f*cking hate perverts,"I'm omw home from a cafe after meeting a friend. Sumakay ako sa jeep na all students ang laman, so they're all wearing either uniform or wash day clothes. Ako, I'm wearing bodysuit and highwaist shorts na mid length.

Maluwag ung jeep specifically sa left side (I'm seated sa right) then it stopped sa isang supermarket and may isang guy na pumasok, may dalang eco bag, wearing a white tee and jogging pants. Idk his age basta he looks old like 35+ i think. I saw him glanced sa left side pero he chose to sit beside me. I didn't care.

Napuno na ung jeep so umandar na. That's when I felt like he's brushing his arm sa side ko. Di ko pinansin kasi naisip ko baka dahil masikip and maalog din ung jeep, but still I try to distance myself na din. Nag-lean forward ako to give his arm a space na hindi didikit sakin. Which is a mistake.

May 1 student na bumaba from our side pero katabi nya. He didn't move a bit kahit may onting space sa side nya so same distance pa din kami. Then I saw him slowly put his right hand sa loob ng pants nya. He used the eco bag para takpan yon. I'm not sure pa that time kung talagang nasa loob ung hand nya since we're sitting beside each other and ayoko naman tingnan directly. I was just thinking that time na sana lang mali ako.

Kapag moving ung jeep, talagang nafifeel ko na he's brushing his arm and even his legs sakin. Then one time I tried to look at him then saktong nakita ko na he's looking at my legs then he looked at me after. Nagulat pa ko kaya umiwas ako ng tingin. At that moment, I may look calm pero deep inside sobrang takot na ko. Ung ride pauwi feels like an hour kahit 10-15mins lang ung byahe ko. Ang dami kong gusto gawin/sabihin pero hindi ko kaya. Nainis pa nga ko sa mga nasa loob ng jeep especially sa katabi ko kasi ang tagal pa bago nila bumaba.

Nung lumuwag na sa loob (3 na lang kami) , lumayo agad ako sa kanya. I went straight sa dulo ng jeep. I don't want to look at him kasi sobrang nandidiri ako. But I still see him sa peripheral view ko and he's glancing towards my direction and then masturbating (like up and down gesture ng arm). Sobrang nakakapanghina ung nangyari.

This is not my first time. I've experienced sexual harassment in public (if that's what it's called) a couple of times na. Lagi ko sinasabi na i will not let this happen to me again na hindi ako kikibo. Pero lagi lang ako nagfi-freeze. Na parang nawawala lahat ng tapang ko. Nakakaiyak na lang kasi wala man lang akong nagawa, na parang hinayaan ko lang sya na gawin sakin yon.

Pagkauwi ko, gustong-gusto ko magvent out. I'm currently shaking pa while typing this. I just want to let this out of my system kahit paano, kahit dito lang. Hindi ko masabi sa parents ko kasi magiging reason nanaman to para mas higpitan nanaman nila ako sa paglabas sa bahay. I wfh na nga kaya minsan lang ako lumabas tapos ganito pa mangyayari. Hindi ko lang talaga alam kung ano dapat mafeel ko..",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/10gs0ii/i_fcking_hate_perverts/,t2_ulgxj3ng,2023-01-20 16:52:06,5
Just wanted something off my chest.,"
Hello, I (20M) still hold a grudge against my ex from years ago, and still blame her partially for my issues.

It was around '19, I was still in 10th Grade, I was 16 at the time and had been in a relationship with this girl who's 18 at the time, and in 12th grade. I knew the girl for quite some time before entering the relationship, and I had devoted myself to being faithful in what we had.

But as time progressed, little naive me would've never known that I was in a toxic relationship, one that I would never forget as years passed.

I remember taking her out on dates, wherein she would never finish the food that I paid for (I didn't mind paying, I was just a little upset that I had to pick her up from school to excitedly ask her out on a date only for it to be ruined in the end; we went to the same school), and there were times that she would tell me stories that someone was courting her, as we were in a relationship. I remember the time where we were out on a date, and she would tell about her lover, and that she'd visit him after our date.

She then gave away the drink I bought to a mutual acquaintance we came across, as we parted ways. I would always be her crying shoulder when she was ""bullied"" by her co-workers (she was doing OJT at the time, as a pre-requisite for graduation). I wasn't very demanding in our relationship, all I wanted was to be there for her.

Months passed, and I broke up with her. I realized that she was cheating on me (what a surprise!) after she had a baby picture of her lover posted as her Twitter cover. I cried my heart out that afternoon. I thought everything will be better for me, and boy was I wrong.

After we broke up, this was when it really hit the fan. She started stalking me outside of school, I would always see her looking at me whenever I exited the school premises. She would make a fake Twitter account, pretending to be someone else just to justify her cheating. She even went to my dad's workplace the week we broke up. I think the worst thing she ever did to me was accuse me of sexual harassment. That shit broke me. I was 16 at the time, I didn't know what to do. Word got out to her friends about the accusations. I've never felt so low in my life that I actually was rushed to a hospital because I was clinically depressed and had high suicidal tendencies when I was 17.

I used to never speak about this, but as I grew older, I know that keeping it in will only make me suffer. I don't think I deserved all that at such a young age. I still am angry for everything that happened. Am I the asshole for still holding on to that grudge? 

Anyway, I last saw her back in '20, around Valentine's Day, she was with her boyfriend (who was initially her lover) at McDonald's, I saw them looking at me, whispering at each other, and her man, being 4'9 threatening to beat me up. After that, I never saw them ever again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/118tx9g/just_wanted_something_off_my_chest/,t2_aez45eg0,2023-02-22 17:34:41,2
"A lot of extreme ""woke"" people are performative, bullies, & hypocrites.","There I said it.

Isa akong isko, graduated in UP 7+ years ago, also took part on some rallies.

Now that I am an adult, mas nagsink in sakin kung gaano ka-performative yung ""woke""ness ng karamihan ng mga tao. There's a certain amount of ""woke"" that's good, but the extreme? You'll realize that those who display extremes are those that are self-absorbed, self-righteous, and bullies.

Scrolling on Twitter is so chaotic.

I saw this tweet one time about someone expressing their annoyance & traumatic experience about how they got robbed by their helpers despite treating them nicely then i saw bunch of ""woke"" netizens ganging up sa nagtweet na kesyo elitist daw and bakit ba poor people deserve good things naman daw, and na kaya naman nila bumili ulit ng mga bagong gamit at kitain yung pera.

Napakunot nalang ako ng noo.

Sure, everyone deserves good things but not to the extent na okay lang pala mang-nakaw sa iba.

Galit sila sa magnanakaw pero kung mahirap ang
nagnakaw, kung may kaya ang ninakawan, okay lang. May free pass? May valid reason? Yung ninakawan pa rin ang hahanapan ng butas?

Then there's this tweet about people debating & forcing their ideologies on others na mag-bike nalang or mag-commute, hating all private car owners, as if everyone is fit to bike & commute, and as if commuting is safe esp for women. I have a fiancé, and almost any girl I know who commutes na-harass na sa public transpo. You can't blame if people would want to pay extra just to feel safe.

I know, it sucks. But until anything related to ""public"" is unsafe, uncomfortable, at nakakapagod... then people will keep looking for ways to get away from that.

It’s their way to survive the system.

These extremists will keep pushing their ideologies to you, favor the poor regardless if in wrong, try to change the system but can't propose anything concrete other than ideals & delulu fantasies, then bully you & call you an elitist until you become one of them.

Sobrang divisive.

Too much of extremes are really scary nga talaga.

Sa totoo lang, middle class ang pinaka-nagsusuffer yet they are villainized so much.

Madalas kahit hindi naman necessary, kahit mali na nga, gagawan pa rin ng ""woke"" discourse, ipinipilit.

It's all just fire.

When you meet these people in real life, they're the most toxic, bully, and problematic people. Magaling sa salita pero gago on how they treat people in real life.

I know so many tibaks na woke na woke pero sexual predators and physically abusive sa partners in real life.

They don't care about the betterment, they're just addicted to this feeling na ""superior"" and ""smarter” sila.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/18j47bw/a_lot_of_extreme_woke_people_are_performative/,t2_q0g2ay9tt,2023-12-16 00:38:22,5
Maginoong Naging Sobrang Bastos,"
22 years old na ako ngayon pero nangyari ito noong 2016-2017. Nanggaling ako sa Born Again Christian family and super religious kami magmula noong bata pa ako. May nakilala akong isang bagong member ng church namin noong 2016. Kamukha niya si Ping Medina. Ayun lang ang masasabi ko. 

Nagsimula kaming magkausap noong Dec 2016. At that time, 16 ako and siya ay 19. So basically, minor ako. Nagkakausap kami through text kasi mahina ang signal sa probinsya namin. Nagkadevelopan kami hanggang sa nagkaaminan kami na gusto namin ang isa't isa. Hanggang sa nag-I love you siya sa akin pero hindi ko kayang sabihin yung 3 salitang yun sa kanya because, well, never ko pa nasabi yun sa isang lalake. Noong hindi ko sinabi pabalik, nagalit siya at hindi nagparamdam sa akin for 2 days. I am actually ready to let go him and my feelings towards him pero nagparamdam siya bigla at ako naman si Tanga, nag-entertain ulit, which is dapat hindi na lang.

Fast forward, nanligaw naman siya sa akin ng maayos. Nagdate kami sa sinehan and he's an actual gentleman. Siya naman ang gumastos sa lahat ng dates namin. Una, sa cheeks pa lang ang kiss and holding hands ganun.

2nd date. Nagkiss na kami in actual lips. Nagulat ako syempre 1st kiss ko yun and na caught off guard ako dahil hindi ko ineexpect na ikikiss niya ako. Well, pumayag naman ako. Wala namang problema yun.

3rd date. Nagulat ako nung nilabas niya na yung private part niya and everything. Hindi ko ineexpect yun dahil nga galing siya sa church and inaasahan ko na mabait siya at sumusunod sa word of God. Hindi pala. I just go with the flow and hindi ko alam at that time na sexual harassment pala yun kasi believe me or not, it's against my will and not to mention na minor ako.

Hanggang sa nagpatuloy kami sa ganung gawain at nasanay na ako sa ginagawa ang gusto niya dahil kapag hindi ko gagawin yung mga gusto niya, nagagalit siya at hindi niya ako kakausapin ng isang araw. Syempre ako naman si tanga, gagawin ko ang gusto niya dahil mahal ko siya.

Hanggang sa nagalaw niya na ako 1 week before my birthday which I'll be turning 17 at that time. Hindi ko inaasahan dahil ayoko talagang magpagalaw dahil hindi ako ready pero pinilit niya ako at sinabi niya sa akin na makikipaghiwalay siya sa akin kapag hindi ko daw ginawa ang gusto niya. Natakot akong iwanan niya ako kaya ginawa ko.

Pagkatapos nung nagalaw niya na ako, napansin ko na nawawala na ang sweetness niya sa akin hanggang sa humingi siya ng cool off. Nagtaka ako kung bakit at hindi ko maintindihan. Okay naman kami noong nakaraan. Ang rason niya sa akin ay nahihiya na daw siya kay Lord sa ginagawa niya sa akin and need niya daw ng time to think. Alam ko reason lang yun pero pinagbigyan ko siya.

Sa 3rd day ng cool off namin, nakita ko ang convo niya at ng isang babae at sinasabi nila na meet up daw sila sa location na 'to, etc. Noong sinearch ko yung lugar, awit, motel pala. Hahahaha nagcheat sa akin habang cool off. So syempre ako tong si tanga iiyak lang.

Doon nagstart ang overthinking ko at distrust ko towards him. 1 week kaming cool off and trust me, it's been a hell hole for me. Halos hindi niya na ako kinakausap tapos nagkikita lang kami for s3x. Naging selfish siya at ako lagi ang gumagastos. In short, pinerahan na lang ako at ginamit sa katawan ko. 

Anyway, nagbreak kami after 7 months of relationshít.

Hindi pa nagtatapos ang story ko. Nagbreak na kami pero nakuha niya pang magtry at mag-contact sa akin para sa s3x. Hindi na ako pumayag kasi hindi naman kami. Ang mas nakakagigil is noong kinasal si Mama, nagsend siya ng video na you know, pagkatapos sinabihan ba naman ako na imagine ko daw nanay ko na iniiyót ng ganyan after wedding.

Hindi ko pinalampas yun, mga ka-Reddit. Pwede niya akong bastusin pero hindi ang nanay ko. Pinagmumura ko siya at pinagsabihan ng derogatory words such as cheap and squatter na ugali. Alam ko sasabihin niyong masama ang ugali ko pero hindi ako magsasalita sa kanya ng ganyan kung hindi niya dinamay ang nanay ko. After that, blinock ko na siya.

Kaya please mga ka-Reddit, hindi lahat ng nanggaling sa simbahan ay mababait, okay? 'Wag magtitiwala kaagad.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/w135da/maginoong_naging_sobrang_bastos/,t2_np2vosv2,2022-07-17 17:02:24,31
Para sa kababata kong walang hiyang humihingi sakin ng n*des at pinipilit pa ako before,"Online sexual exploitation

Hindi ko pa rin talaga ma-imagine na I stooped so low for my kababata/churchmate na mukhang mabait pero todo hingi sakin ng malalaswang vids several months ago. We got close last year lang kahit magkakilala na kami since bata pa dahil sobrang tahimik niya, and ayun, naging MU kami. For the first 3 months na nag-uusap kami, okay naman at di ko pa napansin that I was being love bombed by him. Things got worst last December, when he suddenly opened about a NSFW topic abt him and random na humingi ng bo0b photos ko. I was angry at first dahil nga ayoko, pero sobrang pilit nya and I gave in. Nung una it was just like that until he also asked for my video while pleasuring myself, at nagagalit pa sya pag di ko pinagbibigyan ang gusto niya. Okay pa naman yung communication namin during the time na he went to the city para mag review for LET (yes po, he's an aspiring high school teacher). I told him na meron naman sa mga porn sites, but he prefer the ""real"" daw. Since desperate ako sa mga replies nya, there are times na I am the one that was sending him vids like that. Everytime na I will confront him abt that, he will just switch the topic at di ko talaga makakalimutan ang mga sinabi niyang ""okay lng kahit di tayo magkatuluyan, atleast nalabas mo ang hormones mo sakin"", ""if ever i will fuck you dog style ang gagawin ko para sagad"" ""di ka naman magaling mag m*sturbate"" and ""joke lang yun, naniwala ka naman"" HAHAHHAHA the audacity to say that eh gusto niya ng close-up vids ko with my facial expressions and moaning. I never thought na magigung ganito ako and I tolerated him to objectify and disrespect me for months, and I didn't even get the apology from him. It was already late that I realized na ayaw niya akong i-pursue at puro kabastusan lang talaga ang intention nya sakin. I can't see him as the tahimik, mabait na anak, and matalinong klase ng tao after what he did to me. I already told my friends and my siblings abt this matter, ayoko na rin magsumbong sa pamilya ko since adult na ako at ayoko nang ma victim blame pa ulit (I was also harassed by his relative din), I just want to vent out dito dahil I know na this is safer compared to other socmed platforms.

I don't know what to feel,"Just wanted to share. I've always been indifferent with almost everything i don't know what to feel in different situation and i never really got excited because a reward or a great news came to me. I feel that influencers and actors are ordinary people even if they're in front of me. I've grew up under my parent's protection and i could say i could be what you say as sheltered or privileged person we're not rich but i get what i want. I feel like i'm being too controlled by my parents and i couldn't get out of it anymore, i give them whatever they ask for like grades, chores, university choice, and more. I know the feeling of happiness but i rarely experienced it ever since i was 10 ig and i'm already an adult. I know fear cuz i experience it a lot since i grew fear of men from being a victim of sexual harassment when i was 11 or 12 (i don't wear revealing clothes but that time i was wearing my school uniform which cover everything necessary) although i  have male friend i tend to not get too close to them or touch them too much and i wanted to have a relationship but fear gets to me first btw i'm straight so it's even harder. I used to be a happy and extroverted child but when reality hits me on how cruel the world is, it hit me so bad that it still hurts whenever i remember it. The people who i trust the most didn't believe me and instead blamed me and teased me telling i was the reason that happened to me. Yes i got trust issues and i hate looking to other peoples faces and eyes because it reminded me the disgusting look that man gave me. Although i can't remember his facial features, i will always know the disgust and feeling.  There were also times when i wanted to resort to suicide because of everything i'm dealing alone but the restraint i have the responsibilities of mine kept me from going to that dark path but the longer i suffer i seem to be drifting and drowning and i can't breath anymore. I can say that i do look quite good even without make up and i still experience stuff like strangers crossing boundaries, looking at me with lusty eyes, asking explicitly for smth so i will just ignore them. I'm not confident about my self so i wear conservative clothes and my opinion due to my fear that no one believes and wants to listen to me. The personality i have now is a result of various experiences of mine. I thank God that nothing worse happened to me at that time and i encountered a friend of mine who help me then but still couldn't catch the man who did that. It's not about what you wear, the problem is perpetrator and they need to think morally and ethically. I'm actually living normally, i get anxiety attacks form time to time whenever i recall it or experience too much stress although my family don't know it. I just want to live my live quietly but there are people who seem to not want it. My thoughts are messy sorry for the unorganized thoughts and experience of mine that i want to take off my chest.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/wf5r4t/i_dont_know_what_to_feel/,t2_7yv15ytv,2022-08-03 20:48:38,3
My family is siding with someone who abused me and wants me to not file a case,"TW >!Attempted Sexual Assault and Financial Abuse!<

&#x200B;

On the outside, it looks like I have a decent family who I help with (mostly financially).  I voluntarily helped because as young as 15 I had to take jobs to help support them financially, that's how they raised me, I have to sacrifice my needs and prioritize everyone else before even daring to think of myself. It's a huge extended family too, think 35++ members.

&#x200B;

If I don't prioritize someone else, I'm the worst scum of the earth. I've only recently found out that what they're doing to me is financial abuse. I've always known that they are emotionally and verbally abusive, but the finance thing is a recent thing that clicked in my brain.

&#x200B;

My mom pressured me for almost a decade to take care of her brother. She insists that we're the only family he has (despite him having a living wife, 3 adult children plus 1-3 illegitimate minor kids). He claims he's separated (but actually not). My mom travels a lot for work and is abroad about 9-11 months of of the year.  I ended up stuck with him. He lives in our house with everything free + my mom sends him an allowance.

&#x200B;

I've always kept track when he comes home drunk. He breaks stuff, he berates me, he steals my money, jewelry, phone etc. I have always begged mom to kick him out but she insists he's her brother so he stays. I was told I need to learn some compassion and start caring about my elders.

&#x200B;

It kept on escalating. From ashtrays being thrown, to dishes, to pots, to even breaking our windows. I kept reporting to my mom, she ignored my pleas for help. I was getting decent salary but couldn't save because he'd break my stuff if I don't give him ""his cut"" of my salary. After a few years of work, my boss gave me a raise. He has suspicions on how my life is at home so we made a deal about getting me a house.

&#x200B;

I wanted to move out but my mom kept on guilt tripping me to stay. Uncle escalated worse during the pandemic. With my friends and coworker's urging, I finally got my house furnished since last ber months.

&#x200B;

I guess my uncle figured out I'll be gone soon. He tried to SA me. I thought I won't see the next day, he had that look in his eyes that once he's done with me, I'll be permanently gone. He always hated me because he had to share mom's salary to me. I don't get his logic he's been stealing a good chunk of my salary anyways. I tried to make everything online for a few times but he breaks stuff like our windows if I don't give him ""his cut"". It became a bigger expense that giving him ""his cut"".

&#x200B;

My family has minor political ties, I tried reporting what happened to me. Family minimized it. Says it didn't end up happening, I'm safe, what am I making a fuss about. They blocked me from going to the police or even the barangay. They called in advanced so I won't be accommodated.

&#x200B;

I went through a friend who got me a private lawyer. They got wind of it and are now saying they'll throw me in jail for perjury, defamation, whatever they can think of to shut me up so I don't ruin my uncle's life.

&#x200B;

I had a breakdown yesterday in a family meeting.

&#x200B;

No empathy for me. I was told to stop the dramatic act and start acting like an adult. Stop being dramatic. I'm heartless for even thinking of going to a lawyer. I was told I'm abusing his family because I'm tearing them apart. I feel so helpless. I can't believe I'm getting more care from co workers over my own family who I sacrificed so much for I helped a good chunk of them financially by juggling what's left for me, sometimes even getting into debt to help them out. But in this time of need, I'm nothing but garbage to them. I can't accept help from friends bc they get harassed too.

&#x200B;

I don't even wanna end my life out of spite because I'm sure they'll just party with my life insurance payout.

&#x200B;

Edit for some clarifications : The huge extended family varies on financial capability. Grandparents did their best, but more than half of their kids blew it up, including abusive uncle. Mom and a couple other siblings are doing well money wise, so I usually get contacted for financial help.

March 6 update : I have senior dogs and a cat, I guess I have to accept that I'm not seeing them anytime soon. Or at all. I was able to sneak them out to a friend's house before the meeting in the barangay, friend is a cat-lover so she's keeping my cat. The senior dogs will go together to my boss' relatives' home. They said they'll foster for now but are willing to adopt if I can't take them back. 

They were able to get my passport from the office lockers, IDK why I didn't bring my bag I take as hand carry home but I'm thankful I didn't.

I'm taking chances on how slow the legal system is, maybe I'd still be able to leave if I try now. Fight or flight? I hate taking the flight option but in this case it looks like I'm going to fight a losing battle. It's better to leave.

My boss said he'll rent out my house and try to find out a way to send me money. I told him he should be ready to face some of my relatives who would look at what's happening to me as a sign that they'll have a free house to stay in. He said he's so pissed on my behalf that he'll happily take that challenge.

Well, here's to hoping I can still leave


Update March 8.
I decided to not leave the country. Baka kasi lumabas sa judge na tumatakas ako because of guilt. I decided to retain a lawyer. 

I'll continue being on the move cities to cities until the time I have to face them in person.

My boss is getting more harassments so even tho he was refusing, I asked him to terminate my employment. He told me he will welcome me back when things settle.

One of the things they were harassing him for is the address and keys to my house. He said no. 

We'll have to figure out the best way to deal with that house, boss still wants to hold it for me and said I can pay the 75% difference if I still want it later.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/11icoqz/my_family_is_siding_with_someone_who_abused_me/,t2_vhu8iwgx,2023-03-05 04:44:42,12
The Sacrificial Lamb (1),"[!!!TRIGGER WARNING!!! death, s***ide, r*pe, sexual harassment]

(STRICTLY NO SCREENSHOTS po please thank you)

I am currently 21 years old. My grandma raised me from birth hanggang 5 years old ako until my mom decided to take me from my grandma to make me live with her, my halfsis and my step father. My biological dad has always been out of the picture even until today, he never cared and he is an irresponsible one. My stepdad, however, is supporting me financially and is feeding me but he was never a father to me. Also, he was a drug user, so he was aggressive most of the time. Lumaki akong takot na takot sa kanya kahit I have very few memories of living with him together for the reasons na he always yells at me, pinapalo niya ako ng sobrang lakas kahit di naman grabe yung kasalanan ko and at times he even abused me emotionally. My half sister naman, we were never close until recently. Malayo ang loob ko sa kanya kasi she hates me when we were still kids, there was this one time when I was in Grade 1 and kumakain kami ng dinner she suddenly looked at me disgustingly and asked me ""bat ka kumakain kasama namin? di ka naman parte ng pamilya."" Her words hurt me a lot na after that incident never na akong kumain kasabay sila until ngayong 21 na ako, I always made excuses so I can eat alone. Let's fast forward to August 2016, umalis kami ng bahay and iniwan yung tatay ng  kapatid ko doon to live sa ibang lugar (same city pa rin). The cause of my mom and the stepdad's separation was that his addiction was getting worse and he apparently borrowed money using my mom's name. Yung halfsis ko naman sometimes sa old house namin umuuwi galing school, hindi naman abusive tatay niya sa kanya kaya malapit loob niya dun. After leaving my stepdad, I finally felt the ""peace"" na sinasabi nila. I was no longer living in fear as there was no one to do me harm na. Living peacefully made me forgot almost 85% of my childhood memories for unknown reasons, how did I know? During SHS, we were tasked to write an essay about our childhood but when I tried to think about my memories almost nothing came to mind and it even got to the point na I panicked kasi it felt so weird and I was really confused bakit halos wala akong maalala. 

Nung December 2018, I was eating Jollibee takeouts with my mom after her check-up (may sakit siya sa uterus po). Then suddenly may memory ako from July 2016 na biglang naalala; it was when I ordered food for the first time in the same fastfood resto and upon going back sa seat namin, I saw my mom and my young halfsis crying together tapos I asked them why were they crying but none of them answered me. I asked my mom about that memory and she stopped eating for a while and looked at me seriously, she then proceed to tell me the whole story. When I was ordering our food, my mom told my sister pala about her plans on leaving my stepdad. My halfsis was initially against her plan daw until she told my sister the biggest reasons why she decided to leave her dad. Sabi ni mommy sinabi niya daw kay halfsis ko na, stepdad was extremely violent pag hindi nakakagamit ng drugs. So violent na he even forced my mom to have sex with him with the ""or else"" situation, that monster raped my mom. My also told my halfsis na when I was in grade 4, yung out niya from her work is around 10pm and may 1hr+ na travel time din from workplace to bahay. One day yung sinasakyan ni  mommy na tricycle papuntang bahay is tumirik daw bigla but since mga 2 kanto na lang din naman yung layo ng bahay namin, nilakad niya na lang daw. Almost midnight na pagkauwi niya sa bahay, and she was bewildered sa nasaksihan niya. It was my stepfather playing with my private part habang tulog ako, nakababa daw yung panties ko. I WAS IN GRADE 4 AT THE TIME FOR THE LOVE OF THE LORDS. She confronted stepdad and he vowed to never do it again daw. Mom also told me ALMOST ALL OF THE ADULTS IN THE FAMILY KNEW ABOUT IT. I was so shocked to hear that, because it happened when I was very young, I can't remember anything from those times and NONE OF MY UNCLES, AUNTS, LOLO, LOLA, EVEN MY MOM, WARNED ME AGAINST STEPDAD. I felt so betrayed at the time that I cried so hard, I felt sick, I felt dirty. I was angry with myself that I was vulnerable, I was angry at my family for not telling me anything for 8 years about this. My mom told me that she waited for my sister to be old enough to understand why my mom had to leave her dad, thus reason why I only knew about it that late. Made me realize in the most painful way that I am the less loved anak between me and my sister, since my mom was willing to make me a sacrificial lamb for the younger anak. (Little did my mom know that after THAT incident, I was still sexually harassed by stepdad. During high school, I often caught him peeking at me from the window while I was changing clothes, he intentionally brushes his hands on my legs whenever he can and it even got to the point na inaaya niya akong manood ng porn with him, I was 14 at the time. I just never told my mom about it, I was scared.)

Since my mom told me about it, I was never the same person again. But I tried so hard to keep my emotions to myself at the time because I will be having my 18th birthday the next month(January of 2019), I don't want to ruin the mood for that day. I developed extreme distrust to everyone that I lost all affection for people, I hated everyone especially myself, I started hurting myself, the feeling of being betrayed ate me, I was very disgusted of myself that I can't even look at myself in the mirror for 5 seconds, I pitied myself so much that I wanted to kill myself to free me from my misery, I felt unloved. I eventually planned to k**l myself on January 2020, on my 19th birthday because I can't take it anymore. But when I was sleeping on the eve of my birthday, my Mom went to my room and whispered a birthday greeting in my ear and kissed my forehead. I was dumbfounded, I cried and I found myself burning the s**cide letters I wrote for her and my grandma. It was hard but I continued living for my mom even though I was still hurt that she made me a sacrificial lamb for my sister.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/yrrgjl/the_sacrificial_lamb_1/,t2_bggost36,2022-11-11 04:50:55,10
Why I can't survive as a person with autism. It's over for me now so I might as well tell the story.,"\[long story, pasensya na po\] 

Hopeless case nga talaga ako. I've been to the best hospitals and therapists/doctors in the NCR area. One of which told my mom that I will never be happy, so they will just focus on giving me things to do. Unfortunately I heard that, but it happens to be true.

I have autism that went undiagnosed until I was 20something because of the stigma. Even though all the signs were there. Pinabayaan ako. Looking back, kahit magkasakit ako o mainjure sa school walang may paki. Nung grade one ako, nadapa ako sa semento nung may sack race at dumugo ang siko ko. Pumasok lang ako sa klase na nagdudugo sa panyo ko, walang pumansin kahit pag-uwi ko. And I was clueless kaya di rin ako pumunta sa clinic. Tiniis ko lang kung anong sakit ng tiyan o lagnat o bali natamo ko noong bata ako up to high school or college. Nanakawan ako ng wallet sa unang college ko at parang wala lang. I had no friends and thought it was my fault so I made extra efforts, joined clubs. Wala pa rin. Kapag may problema ako nawawala lahat ng akala ko friends ko.

I probably did and said a lot of weird things too but I did not mean bad and nobody corrected me. Was just ostracized for the most part, not actually bullied. I even went on a date with a stranger one night and I was so proud of myself for being brave. Buti nalang sinabihan ako ng kabatch ko na creepy ang nangyari at wag nang makipagkita dun. At least that friend saved me in that case kasi the guy was stroking my thigh during the trip and took me back to the dorm so he knew where I stayed. Creepy nga in hindsight pero sobrang tanga ko. I was 16 and living far from home. I never told my family about this. It was shortly after that incident that my wallet was stolen. Nung nadepress ako nung taon na yun, my family just assumed it was because of the lost wallet. But actually it was a lot of things, including losing the friend who gave the advice as well as the creepy guy. Even now I wonder, what if I didn't listen to her and went with him?

Suggestion ng friends ko online na tumawag ako sa suicide hotline. The problem is I have severe sensory and processing issues. In short di ko kaya tumawag sa phone. I can type a lot of text because I'm only focusing on one thing. Pero pag live conversation overwhelmed na ako. I can't even VC with my own friends, how can I talk to a stranger? Lahat ng suicide hotline sa Pinas walang chat support haha, nagmessage ako sa FB nila. Mamatay nalang kaya ako hahahaha.

Lahat ng mga resources dito for autism ay para sa mga bata at early interventions. Nung bata ako wala pa yung asperger's o high functioning autism kaya walang maitulong sa akin. Now it's too late. Ibuhos ko nalang lahat dito at baka sakali magkatapang akong tapusin buhay ko. Nobody takes my disability seriously anyway. I can't go for online therapy because of the talking problem. Walang combination ng meds na gumana sa akin. Worse, lumala yung health ko. I became obese and developed asthma. Sirang-sira rin ang sleeping patterns ko. All those health problems didn't exist before I took psych meds. Kasi nga nagdoble effort ako nung una, sumali ako sa sports clubs, tried to live healthy and be social.

Pag may nangyaring incident o may problema ako, ako ang sinisisi. Kahit nung nagwowork ako at unfair ang mga boss ko. They would talk behind my back about me and my coworkers. It got so bad na dalawa ang nagquit kaya in the end ginagawa ko trabaho ng tatlong tao, three different offices pinupuntahan ko. And they also accused me of something I would never do, that is to badmouth them to a higher authority. Kasi, not to name names pero working student ako nun. Sa state university ako nagtatrabaho pero sa city college ako nag-aaral. Sinisiraan nila sa work yung city college ko. To the point na mas gusto pa nilang mag-aral sa private school and mga bata na hindi nakapasa sa kanila kaysa mag-aral sa public din. Sabi-sabi na aagawin daw ng city college ang pondo ng state uni. At naniwala naman ang mga bata. Bakit ko naman sila isusumbong sa city eh hindi naman ako close sa mga boss dun? Pero ang masakit talaga ay yung mga accusation sa amin ng mga coworkers ko. Panay ang siraan nila sa isa, slow at bobo daw (pero college grad, paano nangyari yun?), yun pala PWD din siya, mahina ang tenga. Nagkaroon ng incident at kailangan magleave nung taong yun pero nung babalik na, ayaw tanggapin. At the time I was already doing the work of three so we really needed the help. Actually anim ang nirerequest namin na staff. Kahit sino pa yan, sana kinuha na nila.

I had been begging my mom to help me transfer to a different department because it was getting toxic. Twice kinausap namin ng mga kawork ko si mama ko at once we consulted with the HR pero di nila kami nilipat. And then came the almost sexual harassment incident. May three days na Lakbay Aral at sumama doon lahat ng admin pati karamihan ng prof. May isa akong kaclose na male prof, parang tatay ko na yun na naiwan sa campus. Mag-isa lang ako sa admin office noon at sinubukan niya akong halikan sa labi. Natakot ako at sinabi ko sa mama ko at sa immediate superior ko. Kinausap ni mama yung boss ko at sinabing wag akong iiwan mag-isa sa office. Hindi ko siya kinasuhan ng sexual harassment kasi mawawalan ng pension yung prof kung may kaso siya.

Later on gusto ko na talagang umalis sa work ko dahil nga sa hindi nila pagtanggap sa kawork ko. As in gusto kong patayin ang boss ko dahil sa discrimination nila against PWDs. Nalaman nila yun at nagsecret meeting yung admin at mom ko. Edi ang resulta, mag-isa nanaman ako sa admin office at walang maisagot sa mga clients. Ayos, diba? Nakatanggap ako ng angry call from parents saka mga special visitors at wala akong masabi, walang bilin kahit kay kuya guard man lang. We didn't know if the admins will be back and when. Nakakahiya sobra. My mom betrayed me and sided with the bosses who were abusing us PWDs and accusing us of things we didn't do. Nagkaroon kasi ng nakawan sa school kaya lahat kaming staff suspect. Pero yung job orders ang pinag-initan. 

Pagbalik nila, kinausap ako ng campus director kunwari friendly, yun pala pinapagleave ako. Pero nung sinabi ko problema ko tinawanan lang ako. He mocked me. Sabi joke lang daw yung sinabi sa faculty meeting na baka ako daw nagsabi sa city admin na nilalabanan nila yung city college. Joke? May tumawa ba? May nagdepensa ba sa akin, iclear man lang pangalan ko? Wala. Nagwala ko and the next thing I know, I was being pinned down by two men sa labas ng opisina. Bisita lang yung isa at hawak niya leeg ko. Parang gusto pang higpitan sa leeg para takutin ako. As if. I wanted to kill and be killed, suicidal na ako noon kaya walang masama kung tuluyan nila ako. Ganyan sila mga normie/neurotypical, lahat ng problema kasalanan ng may mental illness. Ngayon alam ko nang wala akong kakampi kahit saan man ako magpunta. Isisisi lang sa akin lahat ng aberya. Kaming mga PWD at may mental issues ang laging nilalaglag. Sinisira nila ang mga pagkatao at buhay namin.

Pero di pa din nagtapos kalbaryo ko. Nawalan na nga ako ng trabaho pero tuloy pa rin paninira nila sa akin. May estudyante kasi na scholar, bagong graduate na kaibigan naming mga staff at crush ko. He had financial problems, self-supporting at mukhang on the spectrum din. Pinahiraman ko ng reviewer for CPA. Nanakawan siya ng pera na supposed to be para sa grad fee. Pag-graduate niya ay binigyan ko siya ng konting pera at graduation gift. Nagkataong nanakawan ulit siya after kong matanggal sa trabaho, at nahuli niya yung magnanakaw. Yung ka-staff ko na nagquit pero di pinilit bumalik. Akala namin kaibigan siya but she was manipulating us to think she was sympathetic tapos ganoon nga. Ninakawan mga scholars na gipit na nga sa pera. Tapos bibigay siyang konting tulong para mukha siyang mabait. Inutangan pa ako para mapakita lang na di siya magnanakaw. Unfortunately ang alam nitong scholar-graduate ay kakutsaba din ako. He wrote a long post on FB accusing both the thief and myself of manipulating and stealing from him, and at the same time, blocked me so I can't explain my side. As far as I know, nobody corrected him for my sake.

Pasensya na po sa mahabang story time/rant. Nabubuwisit na ako sa hopeless kong kalagyan. Kung tutuusin nga ay delikado kung maghanap pa ako ng trabaho, considering how easy it is for people to manipulate me baka next time ma-r\*pe ako o mawalan ng malaking halaga o maligaw sa Manila - and then I will still be the one to blame oh diba ang saya?

I can fix her /s,"Hello mga ka- r/OffMyChestPH, this is my very first reddit post and I think dito ko lang ma-outlet yung pinagdaanan ko while keeping myself anon. Please allow me to grieve a failed relationship.

I'm going to cut straight to the point, kahit gaano ka pa ka-positive ang impact mo sa buhay niya, it won't matter if the person won't let go of the past.

This girl, I met her from a friend of a friend. Very different from my past relationship - and NOT IN A GOOD WAY. Marami siyang traumas from her past relationships and has developed a toxic habit for herself and for whomever her partner is going to be.

Not gonna lie, ako na gungong pinatulan ko pa rin regardless dahil cute, chinita girlie HAHAHA, pero I also thought people change and if exposed to something good e - they'll see to it na hindi na papalampasin. I was consistently decent and patient with her throughout the relationship. We actually became exclusive daters. Heck, I actually grew from that relationship: trying lots of things, going outside of my box just so I can make her happy - and I did. But her self-sabotaging, toxic habits still haunt our relationship.

Lots of friends have told me na I deserve better. It has become a cycle. I didn't give up because I see willingness from her naman. Nung in-entertain niya ako, she was then with her ex (FWB set-up) pero nakipag-break up din siya bago kami maging exclusive. These red flags are staring me right in my face, but I chose to be ignorant and be hopeful. If you've watched Shawshank Redemption, Red said ""Hope is a dangerous thing. Hope can drive a man insane"". I was living this perfumed nightmare. Ang nakakalungkot, she was also a victim and I cannot be fully angry with her - I chose to be understanding and patient all the way.

Until one day na nakipagkita siya sa ex niya behind my back. She thought na baka mag-exchange gift lang with the guy, pero may ulterior motive si guy. She was molested but she stood firm and told him she's in a committed relationship; but this is where things start to fall apart.

For me naman, nasaktan ako because that happened to her and tinago niya iyon sa akin. I think mahirap mag-stay sa relationship na wala or broken ang trust. It reached to a point na gusto namin ang isa't isa pero we have to break up dahil ayaw niyang may nadadamay siya sa baggage niya; even though I'm willing to be patient sa kanya. It sucks na along with that reasoning, she mentioned na while she's romantically attracted to me pero she's still sexually attracted to that ex (kahit hindi healthy sa kanya). Lalo na the fact na she mentioned how the harassment made her feel something to him put me off. Afterwards, mas nag-deteriorate yung relationship namin. Parang there's this huge elephant na hindi nalang namin pinapansin and mas naging cautious ako around her just not to lose her.

Wala pa isang week since the break-up pero I find peace on it thinking na I did my best and from that relationship parang nawala yung chains for how I should interact with people fearing na ma-misinterpret ang mga actions ko. I have been socially active and reconnected with people na na-damage ng relationship namin. We gain some, we lose some kumbaga.

At the same time, of course, I am still grieving because of the could'ves and the should'ves didn't come to fruition. You can't really force the healing process, every person has to go through it on their own. It sucks na if ever ready na siya, duon pa ako hindi na ready or available. It sucks na the opportunity is already here yet - it didn't come to be. I'm still suffering, but we always have to move with the flow of the river that is 'life'.

I am thankful for this relationship because I learned a lot about myself, and I still have lots of love to give.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1axln8l/i_can_fix_her_s/,t2_8qrq5cgm,2024-02-23 07:43:34,20
"It's so difficult to recover from an addiction, especially when there aren't enough support systems.","Trigger Warning again.

I've been hypersexual for as long as I could remember. It all started out as dumb childhood curiosity, which ended up turning into a life long struggle that I find myself difficult to recover from.

I have been groomed, harassed and I could confidently say that I have abused myself. I use sexual acts as a means to cope from all my various traumas ranging from family, school, insecurities and more. 

What makes this more difficult us that I find myself brewing and growing more internalized hate because of how much everything has dawned on me. I have done things that I regret, I have done things that haunt me and fill me with guilt and shame all day and all night. Actually, it's particularly worse when its during daytime because my anxiety smashes my existence into pieces and I create my own self sabotaging actions. 

I hate myself, I hate myself so much that I feel like I'm beginning to have a hard time interacting and socializing with other people. What makes it worse is that I am a man. I have this long standing lingering fear that I might be perceived as manyak when I confide this struggle of mine to someone else. It hurts having to suffer alone, it hurts that there aren't support systems in place to help me recover from this heart wrenching and soul crushing problem that I have. 

I've been trying to recover recently, and I have been trying to look for communities, here and all over the world, but the mere fact that this addiction is received with a block of salt often discourages me to come forward to support groups and confide with them my struggles that cause a lot of internalized distress, fear and anxiety.

This isn't the first time I posted about this problem of mine, but everytime that I do, I get the immense fear of being rejected and shunned, when all I ever want to do is to seek for help and support from people I hope woul understand. 

Every once in a while, I relapse. I find myself breaking my own rules and I end up feeling guilty about it; and everytime that I do, I end up wanting to hurt myself for being the way that I am. For being the flawed individual that exists in this cruel world. 

I get flashbacks to when I crossed the line before. I get severe moral injuries and in as much as I want to hold myself accountable, and to punish myself for all the stupid things I've done, I keep realizing that I perpetuate this self destructive behavior that doesn't help me in any way. 

I always try to make myself feel better for the shit that I have done, by hurting myself, by physically exerting myself to a point of which I can no longer breathe or walk, but then I end up realizing that in the process of doing so, I also ruin myself when the time comes that I recover.

I always hope that I recover, I always hope, that one day I would have sexual sobreity and manage my own traumas in ways that don't harm me and others. I always hope that I won't be rolling in my own shit filled grave, and I always hope that maybe one day, I could finally give myself the peace and grace that I have for so long yearned for. 

All I want is for myself to figure things out, and for so long I thought it would be simple. But it's not, it's a struggle that I face. I wish that one day, I get to find a healthy relationship with my body and my desires, I wish one day, I get to reach that hope that I've been looking for.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/12rejcm/its_so_difficult_to_recover_from_an_addiction/,t2_935kirllt,2023-04-19 11:03:04,1
How can I deal with a friend that's currently trauma dumping?,"TW: mentions of s\*icidal ideations, ed, self-harm, sh

Hey there, I just needed to get this off my chest as it has been weighing a lot on me lately. Also, I'm using a throwaway since I don't know if they have Reddit too.

Background about me: I (20) had suicidal intentions in the past due to my eating disorders and past sexual harassment that has occurred during my high school years. I'm already a sophomore in uni. I had them mostly managed already through therapy in the past. (I had stopped going because of my financial situation and I had decided to save the money for food and educational expenses.) I think I'm still mentally stable right now.

Now, I had met this person (20) through a class at our high school. We became really close friends after that. We usually chatted about usual things (i.e. academics, crushes, the usual stuff). We then became much closer, and as we became closer, we became more knowledgeable about our personal lives, and I guess we kind of bonded over that (i.e. similar tensions in our family lives, past high school experiences, and what not). I never really shared to them the specifics on how deep my negative experiences are since I really don't want to be defined by the experiences that I have, but they did (which is honestly fine by me, if they did it at the right amount and with responsibility).

At first, I still kept being understanding and thought that maybe they don't have an outlet so I just let them be and I kept responding with affirmatives and encouraging them that everything will be okay. However, as 2022 rolled around, this is when things took a turn.

They met this person and it's really okay at first. But then they started seeing another person and I'm really confused, but they clarified that they are just exploring since they are just friends with benefits with both of them so I'm just like okay, as long as they are consenting like it's okay. But then, when the first person does not want to have anything with them, they started to go into a spiral.

I noticed a shift in their behavior and they started taking more risky activities such as drunk driving, not taking their supposed classes, and binge drinking. They would talk about these things with me and I would be extremely worried about their well-being since they are my close friend. I would still attempt to talk them out about these things but to no avail.

This eventually morphed into suicidal ideation, which they had constantly talked about to me. I encouraged them to go talk to a mental health professional but due to negative experiences with their MH professional previously, they are not willing to go even though I repeatedly bring this up when they talk about their mental health struggles. But this had gone on now for three months and I am starting to feel tired and really anxious when I talk with them. I don't want to cut them off since they are my only friend right now (which I know is a selfish reason), but also I am afraid they will actually push through with their plans if I lose contact with them, since they are also constantly talking about how they are really alone. I also feel like every time they talk about doing it, it has been really triggering for me, where I could vividly remember my previous attempts.

I'm honestly okay with being as an emotional vent but because of current time constraints and priorities shifting since I'm about to become an research assistant and the academic workload that comes with being a soph and also wanting to take care of my mental health since this has been burdening me a lot everyday.

(I can't contact with their parents or family because of said tensions, which is borderlining abuse to be quite honest, and I don't know any mutual friends with them that can also assist them, so I really don't know what to do.)

So any advice on how to deal with this? Please point out where can I be better on how should I have dealt with this, since I'm at a loss.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/z7lnf6/how_can_i_deal_with_a_friend_thats_currently/,t2_un04y83t,2022-11-29 14:24:57,2
