Multiple physical abuse at workplace by an Ex.,"I apologize if im posting in the wrong sub. I desperately need to get some insights and legal/relationship advice about a situation I'm in. (Long post ahead/Created a new account specifically for this) 

I (f29) was again physically attacked by an ex (29m) sa office last night,, we are both working on the same company. This has been going on for a year and we dated about a year and a half. I ended the relationship kanina lang ng umaga, nung nagka-chance ako, pero I need to know if its worth fighting for myself or aalis nalang ako sa trabaho and iiwan ang magandang opportunty and promotion na darating this coming 2024 after years of harwork. 


Background: We were atleast 8 months in nung nalaman ko na He's been taking his meds due to anger management and anxiety. Being the partner who was supportive and understanding, I embraced who he was wholeheartedly. The beginning of a relationship was definitely happy one despite of some serious antics kapag naggalit sya for just because reasons. Ex: hindi nya nagustuhan ang suot ko, at may nakausap ako na lalaki sa trabaho (I'm a trainer and that's what I do, I train people until they are fully equipped). At first, nakakayanan ko pa to, mura doon, mura dito, block dito, unblock doon, etc etc. I was very understanding and palagi ko naiisip na, baka nat-trigger lang ung anger issues nya. Kaya I adjusted, I listened to him, and basically just followed everything what he's been asking. Ups and dows, for a whole year and somehow we managed to still be happy and contented. 


Now, here comes anniv - may nakita akong nagtxt sa phone nya. His ""ex partner"". They have a beautiful daughter who is about 12 now and I myself is a single woman without a child. I knew the status from the get go as I was able to confirm that they are co-parenting and I also am in contact sa Mother nya. Nakita ko ung text about the Ex asking where he was. Nakipag-hiwalay ako ora mismo, at nagleave ako sa trabaho ng at least 1 week without asking for an explanation. 


His mother kept on calling me during these times and was the one asked me to listen to her Son's explanation. I gave in.

I listened to Him, he said that the reason why this ex was asking where he was kasi time na nya sa Anak nya. Naniwala ako. (Pero dito na lahat nagstart ang duda, at matitinding away namen)


Fast forward, nagstart na syang mamisikal everytime na umaalis ako sa relationship namin. Sampal, suntuk, sabunot, sipa, kurot, sakal. Name it. Nagawa na nya lahat to sakin. This is plus the name calling, degrading, cursing, and humiliating  sa labas kapag may hindi sya nagustuhan. Tyinetempo na mga pananakt nya kapag walang tao kung asan kame, (ex, parking, bahay, daan), pero madami times na napapansn na ng mga tao sa trabaho kung pano nya ako tratuhin.  Though these are very minimal kasi magaling syang tyumempo and kutob to. Ex, nakaharap ako sa PC, kunware may kukunin sya sa office table pero kukurutin nya ako ng malakas, and sure na magkakapasa. 


I'm done.

 I'm tired, and I'm thinking of ending my own life sa lahat ng pagsisisi ko sa buhay ko and for allowing a monster to do all of these to me. Galit ako sa sarli ko dahil sobrang bobo ko. I grew up na walang Father figure and looking back, nakikita ko ang mga magulang ko na nag-aaway at nagphyphyiscalan and when I met Him, he was able to condition me na He would be that "" right person"". 


Now, my only ask is. Anong pwede ko gawin? Is it worth it na labanan sya sa trabaho by reporting him which will also affect what other people perceive me and fight for what is right which is matagal ko na dapat gnawa or just leave, and start all over again sa bagong trabaho without looking back since nakipaghiwalay na ako at pumayag naman na sya? Natatakot akong saktan nya ako at huntingin nya ako, sakaling I chose the first option.  There were times na papakitaan nya ako ng pic ng baril, yayabangan ako na mga tito nya were either mga pulis, and some are NPA (naconfirm ko lahat to). I want to fight for myself pero natatakot ako..for reference, I have proofs, screenhots, and images of my bruises. I can also easily get cctv footages as i created a journal indicating the date and time whenever may pisikalang nagaganap. 

Please feel free to call me anything you want based sa kwento sa taas. Okay lang. And alam ko makakatulong din. Salamat!",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/1878nk9/multiple_physical_abuse_at_workplace_by_an_ex/,t2_oy0vgp2cs,2023-11-30 11:30:49,0,5
Parents that does not physically abuse but mentally and emotionally abuse their children,"I grew up not getting being hit by my parents, pero i always experience gaslighting + manipulation from them. I really want to get out of this house now, I'm very tired na. Other people doesn't see it kasi its not very obvious pero the damage that its doing is at par with physical abuse. I don't even know what I'm gonna do, I'm trying to make my life better with the help of a psych pero it seems like they are convinced that everything is ""just inside my head"" and is trying to make me believe na what I'm experiencing is just my imagination.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/ntjv6l/parents_that_does_not_physically_abuse_but/,t2_9rqc6taj,2021-06-06 19:39:33,2,1
Tired,"Hello! Can someone chat me please? My brother (15M) who has intellectual disability (PWD) physically abused me again and I feel so powerless. I'm so tired of keeping up with his shit. I'm so tired of people cutting him some slack since he ""doesn't know what he is doing"". If there's anyone out there who's taking care of their relatives who has developmental/acquired disabilities. . .please chat me. I'm at my wit's end. I'm literally crying while typing this.

How do you not let your traumas in the past get to you?,"Is it really hard to runaway from all the traumas you experienced in life? I’m M (32) and I feel like everything I do, I feel like all my traumas are just behind me waiting for a perfect moment to eat me alive. 

As early as 5 years old, I’ve experienced physical abuse from my father (thank goodness he’s no longer part of our lives). From being punched in the face and stomach to being tied up to the ceiling by a rope. He left us for another woman when I was 13. My mom had another lover in 2004 who did not physically abuse me but emotionally, he did. He would tell me nasty things and make me feel that I’m stupid all the time. And good thing they’re no longer together too. 

Years have passed and I got into a few relationships. And I always find myself being stuck with someone who’s abusive (physically and mentally). Somehow, I find it interesting because it’s familiar. 

Now, I’m kind of dating a guy and he seems so nice and kind. But I keep on trying to find something bad about him. Or somehow overthink that he’s doing something bad. I’m not used to this kind of treatment.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/18ajkex/how_do_you_not_let_your_traumas_in_the_past_get/,t2_sfhivrkx,2023-12-04 20:52:48,4,4
I want to be normal,"I went through alot in my childhood from abandonment to physical abuse, rape, mental abuse, and intense bullying. And in some aspects i can see it has made me a better person and im almost thankful for it. 

    But then there is nights like tonight. Where i get reminded of the social problems it has made for me. And for some back info im pretty decent looking, im 6’4” and many people say im one of the best people they know at heart. And im a confident person one on one but when i go out in public and try to have fun and be normal I completely shut down. I cant think if things to say, girls that are attracted to me i cant show them a good time and just be normal. It bothers me quite a bit. I went through alot recently and my mental state continues to decline. Its gotten pretty bad and i know im all over the place, I apologize for that. But i guess the point is i just wish i could be normal and not shut down and actually be able to have fun with friends.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/167rdpo/i_want_to_be_normal/,t2_72ung6vy,2023-09-02 11:12:00,12,8
"Need help, and advice"," 

Hi, I'm a first year college (18) and I recently had a traumatic experience with my current partner.  
please please try to understand first I really appreciate it if I'm the one in the wrong.

TW: Physical Abuse

so technically my partner abused me, literally like physical abuse. Sinabunutan niya ko, sinakal, sinampal, sinapak that I ended up having swollen and bruised face, my blood din sa eyes ko.  
so ofc sasabihin ko what was the reason why it happened, he saw through my phone na may kachat ako sa ig, I told him everything na we talked for two days (AND I KNOW THAT ITS STILL CONSIDERED CHEATING) but please I wont deny it naman kahit hindi kami literal na nagladian or what, the guy I talked to just asked kung san ako nagaaral. pero its still cheating.  
\++Actually pwede ko naman idelete yon kasi I saw it na before handing my partner my phone but then I remembered na some of my cousins will tell me na whenever I asked for something, sasabihin lang nila is ""dun ka magtanong sa jowa mong binubugbog ka"" so being a tanga tanga person, hindi ko dinelete and hinayaan ko siyang makita yung messages, kasi im thinking na kung kaya ba niya talaga kong saktan ulit physically but diko expect yung outcome sobrang worst. I scream for help kasi sa bahay nila yon naganap pero di man lang napigilan ng parents niya. Di man lang din ako kinausap kinabukasan after mangyari yon.  
\+++Our relationship has been toxic na talaga ever since and please wag niyong sabihin na ""why dont you just leave?"" trust me its not that easy. Last year pa nagsimula yung abuse, una verbal lang, ipapahiya niya ko sa family niya, sa public places hanggang sa naging physical and take note minor pako nung first niya magawang saktan ako physically, and hindi siya about sa cheating. Lasing lang siya non and nagalit siya kasi may graduation pictures kami ng mga kaklase ko since gr.7. That was the first, sinakal niya ko and wala siyang emotion while doing it. I know na sana dun palang nakipag break nako pero again, hindi madali I loved that person too much.  
Actually, the sole purpose for this is if pwede pa ba akong mag file ng complain sa mga autorities? Grabe yung trauma sakin, I even need to go to therapy for this, 18 palang ako, yet I experienced this kind of thing na. I have evidence, but only pictures, is it enough? I have been told nadin sa guidance namin sa school na they will help me daw, but hindi ako sure sa outcome kasi my partner has a reputation, his family has money, and tumatakbo siyang sk chairman sa baranggay nila, if ever ba na matuloy yung complaint ko, will it affect his candidacy? please an honest answer will be appreciated. If deserve kong saktan physically beacuse I cheated pleade tell din, but again it was not the first time it happened, ngayon lang talaga ako nag ka courage to speak up. Thank you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/140e5ft/need_help_and_advice/,t2_u8dp540g,2023-06-04 22:06:55,3,6
Idk if this is the right thing to do,"I'm (21F) honestly don't know what to with my life. I can't express my emotions to everyone especially sa bf ko, has su1cidal tendencies, and overthinks a lot. I think this may have started when I was just a child when I was physically abuse (hit, called names, manipulated) by my nanny. It has been 9 years since then but whenever my family recalls her, I feel this deep rage within me that boils out. My parents knew that I was abused but they didn't do a thing because they were always at work at that time and no one would take care of me. 

""Tiis lng jud ate"" That's what my mom used to say. 

Now look where it got me. I have trouble fitting in at school and college, always on edge whenever someone talks to me, I  hurt my bf and the list goes on and on. 

Sometimes, when I remember things that haunted me in the past, I forget the scenarios but the feeling is still there. 

Right now as Im typing these, tears are falling just because I can't control my emotions and overthinks a lot.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/1ac2igk/idk_if_this_is_the_right_thing_to_do/,t2_mi8d061e,2024-01-27 12:36:31,1,2
Drugs that require special yellow prescription,"Hi! Just want to share some info since ang dami kong nababasa na medyo misinformation here sa thread. 

There are some drugs po that requires the special yellow prescription and these are the medications under Schedule II, III, IV and V. The exemptions would be the oral forms of Schedule IV and V as stated in the list of controlled substances sa website ni DDB (Dangerous Drug Board)

So meaning, yung mga Alpraz, Clonaz, and etc, they can be written sa white triplicate prescription as long as complete details just like in the yellow prescription and the S2 License ni Doc. This is based on the Board Regulation No. 1 Series of 2014 of DDB. 

And yes, unfortunately, yellow prescription means it needs a physical prescription kay Dr. and based din sa recent na nilabas na policy, they will no longer be accepting e-prescriptions. 

If hindi restricted drug ang medicine na you are using like Quetiapine, Fluoxetine, and etc, these are normal na medicines na so kahit yung usual na prescription lang and even e-prescription. Sa restricted drugs lang sila mahigpit :) 

So ayun, i hope this gives light sa current issue and i hope for the recovery of all of us! Sending hugs 💕",https://i.redd.it/sf0w92xq5sgb1.jpg,t2_c7wgwytj,2023-08-08 08:23:20,34,12
My weirdly unique coping mechanism,"Nung bata ako I experienced so many emotional, mental, physical, and s\*\*uall abuse. Dumating sa point na at very young age (edarang gr 2) was my first time attempting to unalive myself :) tandang tanda ko yun kasi alam ko kung san ko ginawa yun at kung pano :) . Nung bata rin ako, tuwing nalulugkot o umiiyak ako I force myself to laugh and or smile para malessen yung nararamdaman kong lunkot. Ngayon, di ko na kailangan iforce.

Divorce in the Philippines," Hello! I am a university undergraduate from Singapore preparing for my final year thesis, a documentary about Divorce in the Philippines. Through our documentary, my group and I wish to raise greater awareness regarding the lack of freedom that Filipinos face in getting out of an hurtful and abusive marriage, something that is shocking to most people who are unaware of the fact that divorce is not allowed in the Philippines. 

I understand that the Divorce Bill has not yet been effectively legalised, and hence Filipinos are still unable to get a divorce from their partners, despite being in a hurtful, emotionally and physically abusive marriage that many pray to get out of. I am trying to find out more about the real current situation in the Philippines, particularly from Filipinos who are affected by the lack of actions they can take to get out of their marriage and protect their wellbeing. If you are willing to share about your story, or know someone who might be, please feel free to reach out to me by commenting on this post. I would love to have a conversation with you, and rest assured that everything discussed will be kept confidential! Thank you.

I feel like nothing. Just a nothing taking antidepressants to survive.,"I'm tired of being like this. I'm literally just a corpse taking antidepressants to stay alive. I don't think I'm even meant to be alive anymore. Taking meds feels like playing God, destiny, nature, or whatever is out there.I've fought for so long through all the loneliest and lowest points of my life, only to enter college with failing grades and a boring, lonely life. I've been struggling for so long through all the mental and physical abuse I have experienced, only to enter this cycle again and again and again.

This isn't what I wanted to be. College life was the only thing I expected to have a positive outcome, but it still turned out worse. My grades are failing, and I no longer have motivation to continue.

I didn't want to be a random teenager struggling in college and taking antidepressants just to stay alive.I'm not sad. Just pissed, maybe disappointed? I don't even feel like I'm still alive. I'm just surviving for nothing. And I don't see my worth in staying alive.

Once again, I'm not sad. I just don't want to continue anymore. I don't feel like anything. I feel like nothing. I don't see a future for me. I don't even understand why I exist, or am I even me? I don't know anymore. I just want this to stop. Wala na akong mapupuntahan.

I hate school. I hate the grading system. I hate bullies. I hate toxic teachers. I hate myself. I hate my mental illnesses. I hate cruel people.

i’m thinking of getting therapy but feeling scared,"i realized na i think it’s better to go to a professional than keeping this all to myself. pero takot ako magsabi sa family ko. i’m still 16. hindi kami open. hindi uso ang communication sa pamilya namin. may time kasi na nagsabi ako ng nararamdaman ko sa mom ko, kaso she invalidated my feelings. sabi niya na drama lang to at itigil ko na raw ang mga iniisip kong ito. 

kaya siguro masasabing hindi ako okay kasi na-trauma na ako sa father kong alcoholic. pag narinig ko pa lang na padating na siya, nagnenerbyos na ako. nakikita ko pa lang na lasing siya, nagtatago ako dito sa room ko. i was always abused verbally, and he also abused my mom physically and emotionally, in front of me. that adds more to what i’m feeling right now. ito rin siguro cause ng anger issues ko. 

what makes me not want to get treatment is yung gastos, and di ko kaya sabihin sa family ko what i am going through. dagdag pa ako sa isip at gastos nila. pero, naaawa na talaga ako sa sarili ko. ano pwede kong gawin?",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/193t6ib/im_thinking_of_getting_therapy_but_feeling_scared/,t2_rtk13w9pd,2024-01-11 12:41:05,8,8
a little vent (some inputs would be nice),"hello all, my name's Aea, and i am no stranger to the whole mental health ordeal. i was first diagnosed when i was 16, and i am now 25. i am currently suffering from schizoaffective disorder (bipolar type), cluster b personality disorder, severe PTSD, and ADHD. 

not to make it super long but the gist is--i am a mentally ill minimum wager. Ironically, i come from a relatively well-off family, graduated from the blue school (hello fellow SOH people), and is relatively comfortable. (For context to understand how evil my parents are: we own several properties all over manila and visayas, multiple cars, several club memberships, businesses etc....) Downside of course is--i have evil ,narcissistic, terrible, abusive parents (i am a victim of severe domestic abuse).

Thing is, i am a minimum wager because i do not have aspirations for a corporate life (fuck whatever they teach you in these schools...""you are trained to be managers"" my ass!) and ACTIVELY choose to work in an NGO. i am pretty much self-aware, have learned to cope despite SIGNIFICANTLY LACKING support from my parents (who are loaded with money but hates me too much!!!). I HAVE to go to PGH (i have a white card) for constant therapy and medications (my mom doesnt want to take me to a private health practitioner despite having new luxury bags every now and then 😜 she says it's too much of a burden but proceeds to treat her friends every week 😛). I make my mom buy my meds by guilt-tripping her evil ass and sometimes it works.

lately though, i ran into a problem and had to have my mom buy me a new phone. basically, she thinks  she's giving me too much already and so i haven't had my meds for almost 2/3 weeks now. 

you see, i can buy my own with my salary (which is roughly 12-13k per month LMAOOOOO) but that would mean leaving me NOTHING for savings while my EVIL ASS FUCKING MOM bathes herself in coaches, and kate spades, and hermes, travels almost every year to different countries but refuses to buy her child some medicines because she thinks that child should be ""self-sustaining"" (which i dont really care and plan to be because i do not give a fuck about life and that they owe me reparations for sexually (not gonna go into details) violating me when i was a child, severely physically abusing me, and making my life hell. 

anyway, i have been off setraline and lithium and i have been SOOOOOO TIRED AND SLEEPY AND CANNOT FUNCTION lately and this made me think that i kind of don't want to take meds anymore cause i dont want to live needing medicines (wtf ano yon kung di ako maggagamot mamatay ako).  i don't want to take medicines anymore! i have been drinking them for almost 10 years goddamn! i want a normal life! what do i do!",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/1biidl8/a_little_vent_some_inputs_would_be_nice/,t2_ulh2keq8a,2024-03-19 19:51:48,0,1
I want to unalive my sister then unalive myself,"My father died 14 years ago . My sister is the most important thing of my life . Mother was always abusing then she married my father’s younger brother. I hate him . He is mentally, physically and sexually abusive . Things are getting to hard . I am currently in university and earn a little amount of money. My goal was to earn more and move out with my sister. But that’s not possible I thought I had time to stabilise myself. But things at home are not easy. He is getting worse day by day . I can’t move out . My mother and other family members are useless. I can move out but I can only afford my own cost. But I can’t leave my sister. It was always my plan to unalive myself. My sister is sick , Down syndrome. She can’t survive without me . I only lived this long for her . I can’t do this anymore. Everything is too hard . I can’t watch her suffering anymore. I want to watch a week to see if anything gets better otherwise I’ll unalive her in her sleep then kill myself.

Living with someone who has depression and alcoholic,"Hi. I am living with someone who is alcoholic and has depression. And it’s already taking a toll on me. I don’t know what to do. Feeling ko mababaliw na ko. I’m planning to seek a psychiatrist but I’m still saving up money for it. 

Growing up, I witnessed how my father abused alcohol and how he verbally abused my mom. I’m turning 25 this year and honestly I don’t have a memory of him na walang episode kapag nakakainom. So meaning, bata palang talaga ako nasanay na ko na ganun father ko. 

He was diagnosed with fatty liver last 2020 due to alcohol consumption and he was clinically diagnosed with depression last year. After he was diagnosed with fatty liver nung 2020, wala pang 6 months bumalik siya ulit sa pagiinom. Pa-red wine muna nung una then eventually bumalik na naman sa hard drinks like gsm, alfonso or soju. When he was diagnosed last year with depression naman, the doctor gave him antidepressants. He took that for a while, only less than 2 months. But while taking that, he did not stop drinking alcohol. We explained to him na masamang pnagsasabay ang alcohol and antidepressants. Pero ayaw nya maniwala. So pinapili namin sya, magpagamot or uminom ng alcohol. And he chose alcohol (: 

There’s a routine kapag nagrarant sya. Lahat ng nangyari sa kanya sinula nung nawalan sya ng trabaho, hndi na sya nagtry maghanap ulit. And up until now, he’s blaming it to my mom. My mom still accepted him. Loved him. Gave everything to him. Nakapagtapos kaming magkakapatid with the hardwork of my mom but kahit ganun father ko, we still treated him with respect. Never namin pnaramdam sa kanya na wala syang trabaho. Kasi okay lang naman eh, ang gusto namin maramdaman eh yung alaga nya. Yung pagiging tatay nya samin. But I guess he failed to do so. 

I think we already did everything we can. Yung ibang kapatid ko hndi na umaasang magbabago sya. He was surrounded by us— his family na binibigay lahat sa kanya pero ni minsan hndi nya naappreciate. Everytime na nakikita ko syang umiinom, natatakot na ko at hndi makatulog dahil alam ko na mangyayari. Ilang years na ko nagsusuffer from insomnia because of that. I’m thinking to move out pero iniisip ko ang mom ko pati yung youngest sister ko kung sino kikilos sa bahay pag wala nako. Cause my father stopped being a father for several years now. 

He’s not hurting us physically… But grabe verbally. Sana nga physically nalang. I think I’m emotionally abused. Don’t get me wrong— I love my father. I do love him so much na kahit ganito sya ayoko parin mawala siya sa mundong to. Nilalagay ko rin naman situation ko sa situation nya. Pero hanggang saan? :(",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/197ovgg/living_with_someone_who_has_depression_and/,t2_lou42a7uo,2024-01-16 08:27:01,3,3
How am I going to say that I have a depression to my parents?,"An accident happened earlier in our home and there was an immense banter between me and my father, who is sometimes in a good mood and sometimes not. To make the long story short, it was my fault but I didn't know that an accident will happen because of it. I mean, hindi ko naman talaga sinasadya and nawala talaga sa isip ko. Nasugatan pa si mama dahil sa nangyari pero ako rin naman ang nag-end ng nangyaring accident. My father was busy with his thing and he's just directing, not initiating to move. When everything was finished, hindi pa siya tapos sa kakasalita at indirectly niya lang talaga gusto manisi sa mga pangyayari. This is not new to us, though. He's always like this ever since we were kids and he just wants to victim blame us every chance that he gets. Everyone was high on emotions, hence the unending exchange of words. I'm really vocal when it comes to fights, as I want to speak my mind and I don't want him to step on us just cause he's the ""man"" of the family. He's very authoritative too kaya tingin niya lagi samin ""bobo"". I get it, tinuturuan niya kami pero he just wants to feel highly than us. Basta ang last ko na lang na sinabi is ""Hay. Ang hirap maging bobo! Ang hirap maging hindi perfect!"" 

He's the main reason why I fell into depression and he was the one who caused my traumas ever since I was a kid. All the verbal and physical abuse just haunts me. At times, I would still try understand him but it's tiring, too. I'm not patient that I thought I could be. I don't want to feel this hatred for him until I grow old kaya naisip ko while letting myself cooled down, before this year ends, I want to let them know my MDD diagnosis. I would show them my medcert, my meds before, and my PWD ID and explain to them what I've went through. But, I don't know how would I explain this, as depression and mental health illness is still taboo to them.

Appointment,"Bukas na yung appointment ko sa psych. I've lived with my ex-partner for 8 years who was recently diagnosed as Bipolar. He said na I should have myself checked just to make sure na okay ako. He was physically abusive sakin non and emotionally drained ako non.

Psychologist or relationship counseling?,"Hello. I won’t say na wag niyo ako ijudge because deserve ko naman negative comments.

I’m physically hurting my boyfriend tuwing may mga major away kami like when tinataasan nya ako ng boses or hindi siya nakikinig sakin, o kaya kapag may malala siyang ginawa (wala naman cheating) pero sometimes I feel disrespected, objectified, etc. Pinagmumura ko din siya habang sinasampal ko siya nang napakalakas. Verbally abusive din ako. 

I need help. Pero hindi ko alam kung ano dapat? Also, I’m afraid na baka ijudge ako.

Can someone please tell me how i can stop feeling triggered by an abusive mom?,"My mom is verbally and mentally abusive and when things get out of control, she can become physically abusive too. She screams all the time over the smallest things and tells me that I should just k\*\*\* her. I grew up being emotionally and materially neglected, and I'm an adult now who graduated late because of depression and anxiety. I find it hard to look for a good-paying job because of my depression, so I can't afford therapy yet. I also came from an abusive relationship that lasted for years, and her behavior reminds me of how my ex was like so I get very triggered easily.

I'm here to ask for suggestions or ideas from people who are already going to therapy on how I can avoid getting triggered by my mom every time she's being abusive. This happens every day and I know I can't do anything about her behavior. I want to heal, to function better, but I can't do it since I'm still here in her house and I'm not financially capable to move out yet. I'm not even mentally fit to work and I can say this because I tried applying for an internship to see if I'm capable enough to work and I failed miserably and was always absent because I was having depressive episodes that lead to s\*\*\*\*dal thoughts.

Please share some ideas on how I can handle this. Please, thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/rvx55w/can_someone_please_tell_me_how_i_can_stop_feeling/,t2_fupoc1de,2022-01-04 23:36:06,9,6
How to control anger?,"Madalas uminit ulo ko sa maliliit na bagay. Tipong hindi lang ako maintindihan ng kausap ko, umiinit na agad ulo ko. Basta hindi ko makuha yung gusto ko or hindi na-meet yung expectations ko, nagagalit ako.

Guys, paano ginagawa nyo para ma-control yung galit? Ayoko na ng ganitong feeling. Everytime nagagalit ako sa partner ko sa mababaw na dahilan, pinagsisihan ko pag natauhan na ako. Pag galit ako, kung ano ano nasasabi ko kahit na wala naman syang ginawang mali. Basta hindi ko lang magustuhan yung ginawa nya, galit na ako. 

I'm seeing a psychologist and his impression is naging norm sakin yung madaling magalit kahit sa maliliit na bagay. Kasi ganito yung na-experience ko sa ex ko, lagi syang galit sakin kahit wala naman akong ginagawa na masama. Basta hindi nya makuha yung gusto nya, magagalit sya sakin. Tapos ngayon, ginagawa ko na rin sa current partner ko. My therapist told me na nagagawa ko sya unconsciously. Pagod na ako. Sobrang unfair na rin sa partner ko. 

Meron din akong history ng abuse when I was a child. Also, yung ex ko gave me trauma kasi sinasaktan nya ako verbally and physically.

Anyone estranged from their parents too?,"I’ve been taking weekly counseling to help with my inner child trauma. It’s been challenging the past few weeks. 

I was verbally and sometimes physically abused by both parents and they were mostly absent in my life. I am an only child, 27F. 

I keep getting triggered and anxious randomly such as coming up with toxic scenarios in my head about the future to being anxious that friends and people are judging me. And my hatred towards my parents don’t really go away so I get a lot of toxic thoughts related to them often. 

I feel sad because I can’t relate to anyone  in my circle. They all have good relationships with at least one parent or guardian, and it makes me feel alienated and small. 😞

Is there a way to report a bad therapist?,"I was diagnosed with PTSD & DID last year due to years of emotional, verbal, physical and financial abuse from my family of origin (parents and older siblings) I'm basically the family scapegoat and finally cut contact early January 2022 and immediately sought therapy. My first therapist was awesome! Very professional, highly intelligent and compassionate. But I sadly had to stop seeing him because my husband and I moved to his hometown, from Visayas to Luzon.

I am currently looking around for a new therapist. One of my MIL's friends recommended someone and we went to see her.

From the moment I sat down and started answering her questions she did nothing but dismiss, invalidate, and even *defend* my abusers and their abuse! She downright told me it couldn't have been as bad I said it was and that I should just stop focusing on the past and forgive to move forward.

I politely told her that the word ""forgiveness"" and the whole religion christianity schtick was very trigerring for me as it was one of the ways my abusive family controlled and abused me.

And do you know what she did? She *KEPT* mentioning it and started sharing her own personal life and how she's a christian and the love of Jesus yadayadayada ~ she went on for quite a while, almost 30 minutes

I told her again and again that it was triggering for me and I was already crying and shaking and begging her to please stop talking about it.

And she gaslighted me and said that *I* was the one who brought it up in the first place (I didn't, she did and I only *asked* her to stop and she *doubled down* and kept talking) and that she was only sharing the word of God and said "" If you don't forgive your abusers, God wouldn't forgive you either. 

*DID YOU KNOW THAT??? DID YOU KNOW THAT IF YOU DON'T FORGIVE GOD WOULDN'T FORGIVE YOU EITHER?!?!""*

At that point I realised it was moot trying to talk sense to this person who kept violating a simple and clearly established boundary despite many attempts on my end to make her aware of it and her actually seeing me having a panic attack over what she was doing.

I walked out of that clinic bombed and it has triggered flare ups of my chronic illnesses that are also a result of the abuse I went through.

Is there anything I can do to report her to the proper authorities? Maybe file a complaint against the board?

I know it may not do much or amount to nothing in the end but it hurts to think that many people seeking help in perhaps their most vulnerable state would be subjected to what I went through. And I can't just leave it alone and do nothing.

Any help or advice is welcome!

Please be gentle I am still reeling from the experience

I think I'm a psychopath but not the serial killer type,"So I would like to ask the community if I am a psychopath or just a broken man trying my best to live with the trauma that was inflicted to me when I was young. 

About me: 

* Sexually abused when I was 4 and 6 years old and even when I was in college but I don't really feel anything about it. I do use it sometimes so people can relate to me. 
* Middle child, the only physically abused kid of the family who is hated by his dad because I was/am very brave and palaban. I've held a knife in front of my dad when I was 10 while shouting at him.
* Dad almost cut me off but I was able to look for ways, I was able to become independent at the age of 16, fully financially independent at the age of 20. 
* Started self harm (cutting) for coping and later on for pleasure and for more reasons. I look at twitter beans and styro as a past time or when I want to sleep. I'm not one of those emo asking for help and attention.
* Not suicidal but I've done some dangerous stuff just because I feel like being crazy. Not afraid to die as well not because I believe in after life but because I understand the science behind our existence in this world.
* I am very conscious about a lot of things especially on consequences that can benefit me. 
* Intelligent, I guess. Very rational.  Graduated in a prestigious Uni. I am very calculating. I am of course very skilled and have an awesome career. I've never felt insecure as well. I feel like I've always controlled how my brain works.
* Very unemotional -- or should I say controlled reactions. I am able to show emotions of course but I am so conscious on its purpose that I would always think that it's very manipulating.
* I have trouble understanding love and why a lot of people seem to die when they don't have that connection with other people. 
* I've killed animals -- cute ones, as a culling procedure. Never felt pity but the high that it gave me is scary good. Never killed human beings of course, it's against the law and it's very disadvantageous on my part and there is no purpose for doing it. Also, a big, social animal like us is very difficult to just make it disappear. Such a waste of time and resources.  
* I am very charismatic and I feel like the world is my theater and I am always acting. I have no trouble getting people to like me. The key is to fully separate your ego from the character you're playing. 

I am asking this because I am at my 30s and now realizing that I am very different from a lot of people I've met.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/12x6rp1/i_think_im_a_psychopath_but_not_the_serial_killer/,t2_9gwoyeo8w,2023-04-24 15:03:42,5,20
is this what they call PTSD?,"Alcoholic tatay ko, and he is physically and emotionally abusive pag lasing sya. Ever since nagka isip ako, ganto na sya. So every time na lasing yung tatay ko and nasa bahay si mama or nasa mood makipag away, nagsisigawan sila. Dating OFW mama ko and netong pandemic lang umuwi. 

Ung room ko, malapit sa hagdan, so rinig ko pag nagsstart na ung sigawan nila. Eto ung problem, madalas totoo ung sigawan, pero may mga times na hindi. Ung feeling na parang may nagsisigawan kang naririnig, very muted na tipong di mo na naiintindihan ung sinasabi pero alam mong nagsisigawan. Pag binuksan ko ung pinto, wala naman nagsisigawan, at all. 

Nattrigger to pag nakita ko ng lasing si papa, tas narinig ko na sya na nagmamaoy (which is the triggerpoint ng sigawan nila ni mama). After ko magtago sa kwarto, mga ilang oras, maririnig ko ung sigawan. As in feeling ko talaga nagsisigawan sila tas need ko na bumaba kasi need ko kampihan si mama or baka saktan sya ni papa.  Tas pag silip ko, wala namang maingay. Need ko na ba pacheck up? is this a sign of something worse?

Di ko pa to nabanggit sa ibang tao, pero natatakot ako.

The easiest is to point myself and take all the blame,"Hi, I'm someone who is officially diagnosed with ASD and ADHD. For some time, I've been trying to understand myself through research and through the help of my psychiatrist.

So far, the information that I've been getting about ASD is that it stems from three factors. First one is genetic factor. Second, environmental during pregnancy. And then third, environmental during early stages of childhood.

And I just feel so sad whenever I think about how I was raised, going back to my memories and remembering them now in a much clearer picture because I feel so much safer to deal with them.

First of all, a disclaimer. My parents are good parents. They weren't just given the opportunity to be raised in a family that teaches them how to love genuinely and properly. They came from nothing and yet they were able to walk me through my education and continuously support me in my review studies. They also did their best to make it up to me today. I'm in no way trying to put the blame on them. I'm only describing what happened and how I got here.

When I was a child, my mom would often scream and physically hurt me if I'm misbehaving generally. I know this is the common known discipline for the Filipino culture and quite seen as mild compared to what most experience, but I just discovered that it could potentially be a great contribution to how my brain developed autism.

In addition, when my mother was pregnant with me, she was exposed in a very stressful environment because her own family kind of disowned her (they didn't like how my parents got married bec they were traditional). 

She needed their support because my father's own family is something that she's not comfortable with. Her own siblings aren't welcoming about her situation. So there's that. She was often stressed. She was often crying. She even found herself walking barefoot in the middle of the road and she forgot how she got there. So I guess that explains how she unknowingly became abusive herself.

I just feel so sad and I don't know where to share this. And I feel like I sound like a broken record whenever I open up to my close friends and boyfriend.

I already know what my psychiatrist will tell me. ""I'm not the definition of my impairment, so and so forth."" But deep down I know I am the definition of my impairment because it has shaped my reality despite knowing that I could have been so much more.

I know that because I've been a really good student. I was just not great when it comes to personal relationships. I was very prone to getting bullied in grade school and had a hard time mainting close bonds in high school. I just recently understood how difficult it must have been for my peers at that young age to deal with someone like me. Mentally impaired.

As I entered my early 20s, I slowly saw myself becoming abusive, I think. I was in a toxic long term relationship with a guy who I was friends with prior to dating but ended mirroring his toxic behavior and returning the treatment back at him double the energy.

I have moved on and I know I have forgiven him. But I think I still haven't forgiven myself for how I acted during the relationship. I should have been the bigger person, I should have walked away, but instead I made things worse. Now, I feel like I'm no different than him, I'm just as awful if not more.

I don't know who would I demand accountability from. I can't ask my parents, I know for a fact that if they were in a better circumstance they wouldn't even allow the things that had happened to happen. I can see that now, they're trying their best to make it up to me. Now that they have the means to be a better parent, they're doing their best and I can see with much clearer eyes and a sound mind. 

And not everyone is perfect. Also, I do my best not to blame my mother's family because they have their own struggles to deal with. They were exposed to a very abusive environment as well. My grandfather has his share of awfulness. He was verbally and physically abusive. And I can see from their generation, her siblings and my mom's generation, that they're doing their best to be a better parent than their predecessor. I can see from this angle that they didn't have the tools to support my mom when she was pregnant with me. I used to be bitter against them but now that I have been in my healing journey, I now know how limited resource it was to know empathy. It was something they had to learn by themselves on their own because they were never given the healthy amount of love and care from my grandfather.

As for my maternal grandfather, I'm in this point in my healing that I have forgiven him and understood where he was coming from. I think I would be the same, if I was in his shoes. He was morbidly exposed to the atrocities of war. Mental health was pretty much an abomination to talk about in his time, so help for his ptsd was no where to be found. He is known to have tremors during sleep, dreaming about hearing gunshots even after the war has ended. Years, years, and even before he died, he would still often hear the same gunshots that killed his neighbors and most of his peers.

That's why I don't know who to blame... Or lack of a better word... Who should I demand the accountability from?

I feel so alone. I feel like I'm too much. I feel like I'm a burden to my own family because I think they deserve so much more than what I am and what I can give. And I feel like I can give so much more if I was normal. Because right now, even if I'm not normal, I can already provide them the help that they need. How much more if I was born normal? I feel like so restricted by my own body.

I do my best that I can and because I can't find anyone to demand the accountability from. I can only look at my mirror and point to myself because, you know, why did I even exist? I'm a burden to everyone. I feel like I've hurt everyone that I've touched.

I'm remembering the things that I've done in high school. And the things that I've done to my ex-boyfriend. I should have been the bigger person. I know he did things that were unpleasant but I was no different from him. I feel so much worse because I copied him.

I feel like I hate myself for existing. But I don't want to die. I just want to know how to survive this and how to overcome this. And I just want to know how can I forgive myself for all the things that I've done. 

But I guess it's much easier to die at this point. All of my progress, useless. I am still mentally impaired. I still have ADHD. Despite the medication, it is very much present.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/1b69mms/the_easiest_is_to_point_myself_and_take_all_the/,t2_ksq1i4a2,2024-03-04 20:22:27,0,1

I want to survive,"Hello. I just want to share and let this out of my mind. I'm 28m and just like the others I feel lost. Nasa lowest point na ata ako ng buhay ko ngayon. I was forced to go back sa parents housse, unemployed after nakipaghiwalay ng LIP ko for 7 years last december, January wala akong ginawa kundi umiyak, matulog, magisip. kakain lang ako pag sobrang sakit na ng tyan ko at makakatulog lang ako pag di na kaya ng utak at mata ko na gising. January 16 and I decided ayoko na and attempted na i-OD sarili gamit yung medication ng father ko but hindi natuloy dahil sa sister ko na nagpatulong ng ginagawa nya for school. 2 days after nun sinabi ko sakanya yun and they decided na kailangan ko na talaga ng help. January 18 nag seek na kami ng professional help and sabi Severe Depression and GAD. Now meron na akong meds tina-take. Isa sa umaga, isa bago matulog. Bumalik kami kahapon para sa follow up consultation and alam ko dahil na din sa support ng family ko and ilang childhood friends ko at sa mga sinasabi ng Psychologist lumalakas yung positive thinking ko and naiwawala ko mga thoughts and trauma. 

Before pa kami maghiwalay hindi na okay yung mental health ko. Hindi lang talaga nabibigyan ng pansin dahil pag tagal naman nawawala or nagiging busy sa ibang bagay. Ayoko na din magsabi sa family ko at sa partner ko before kasi nararamdaman ko na nagiging burden ako at minimal na nga naitutulong ko, magdadala pa ako ng problema. Sa span din ng 7 years, yung last 4 years medyo naka experience ako ng verbal at physical abuse pero iniisip ko nung mga time na yun lalaki naman ako at kailangan ko lang siya intindihin. Kahit hanggang ngayon aaminin ko na minsan napapaisip parin ako na pakiramdam ko magiging okay lang ako pag binalikan nya ako which is alam ko mali at patuloy ko nilalabanan.

Gusto ko bumangon at mag move forward. Nag enroll ako sa university ulit para tapusin yung degree ko at para makabawas sa isipin sa bahay na nakakulong lang ako sa kwarto. Lahat ng kaibigan ko may family na and busy sa trabaho kaya swerte na kung makausap ko sila at makita once a month. Anxious ako dahil sa age gap ng mga classmate ko and meron feeling talga saakin na hindi ako belong sa lugar. May takot din ako lumabas dahil same city kami ng ex ko and laging nasa isip ko na makikita ko siya. Challenge saakin everyday na bumangon dahil kahit na alam ko yung dapat ko gawin, nahihirapan tlaga ako at hindi ako okay. Pero pinipilit ko para sa mga tao dito sa bahay na di mag-alala. Sa ngayon, malaking tulong na may nakakausap ako dito sa Reddit, pero madalas isang gabi lang then next day hindi na sila nagrereply. Gusto ko sana makahanap ng mga kaibigan na kahit online makakausap. Napansin ko kasi simula nun, parang may nilo-look forward ako sa araw na ito, may nauupdate sa araw ko bukod sa family ko. Iif may mga katulad ko na naghahanap din ng kausap, please feel free to message me po.

"My teacher found out about my sh, what can I do?","Hi, last week my friends found my vent account on social media, their first instinct was to talk to each other and exclude me from this conversation, they were very worried realizing that I had been doing sh since so long, and that my parents both mentally abused me on a daily basis and sometimes even physically abused me. 
They didn’t tell me that they found my account, I just got called upon from this really sweet teacher. Now, keep in mind that she had seen my scars maybe a month before that and asked me about it, when I lied and said that “it was my pets” she couldn’t really do anything then say that she was here for me if I needed to talk.
Last week she told me that she wanted to talk, turns out my friend had shown her my vent account and explained everything. 
I broke down and told her that I didn’t know what to do and didn’t have anyone to talk to at home, and that I knew that my parents also had it tough, I love them, even tho they’ve hurt me.
In the end I agreed to go se the school therapist, as long as she didn’t tell my parents that I had been there. Two days ago, one day after my first therapist session, my teacher informed me that she had talked to the principal and that they HAD to tell my parents about my sh, or else they would be 
“breaking the law” 
idk if this is true, but I was so worried, she got me a private meeting with principal. But the only thing he said was “I’m sorry, since you’re under 18 we have to”. 
What does he know? He’s a 50yr white old and rich man. 
I feel so betrayed rn, I know my friends didn’t mean for it to go this far, but I feel like they should’ve talked to me. My parents will kill me if they realize I’ve been doing sh. What do I do?

Edit: my dad got a call from school today, they said that he and mom had to go to this meeting on Monday after school. He thinks that I’m in big trouble, or that I’m skipping school. I’ve been crying sm. Idk what to do guys.

Should I get therapy if I don't feel any connection/love for my mom?,"It's my mother's 65th birthday today.

I (32,F) haven't talked to her in months since there was a major falling out within my family (my individual parents, because they hate one another too, with us, their children)

I realized I don't have an emotional connection with her. It feels like, she's just there? I don't feel any particular attachment or love that I feel like I should. Looking back, she did take care of our needs, but she was never there emotionally for us.

As physically and emotionally abusive my father was, he was the one who we mostly had an emotional connection with. He's just really unstable and badly needed some anger management. Weirdly, he's the one that I miss most of the time. Ironically, he's also often the topic of my previous therapy sessions. It was never my mom, because she really didn't do anything wrong. Or anything particularly good?

She was just.... There?

When my husband asked what my mom was doing when my father was ""disciplining"" us, I realized the answer was ""nothing."" She didn't speak, she didn't mediate. She was just there. Like a vase.

I also just realized I never had a proper conversation with her as a child, talking to her mom. The only ones I can look back on was her unloading how much she hated my dad. I know she's been abused too, but why do I still feel less love towards her than my dad who screwed us all up mentally and emotionally? (All three of us siblings have or are going through therapy/medication. They were also diagnosed.)

I do treat her from time to time. Buy her stuff, order her food she wants to eat, and sometimes give her some allowance/pocket money. But looking back, I all did it just because she's my mom, like it's something I should do, a part of my responsibility as a child. I never felt that way when I treat my dad. With him, I felt proud & accomplished.

I also realized I've never actually hugged and kissed my mom. Like maybe when I was a toddler, maybe I could have? But for as long as I remember, I have not. Not even once.

Is this something I should get another session for? I honestly feel weird realizing all of this. Almost guilty. And just now, I also just realized why I have an unhealthy relationship with my MIL but not with my FIL.

I slapped my girlfriend. I need help.,"A little backstory to give context to my situation. This is not an excuse. I know I need help. This back story is just for context. 

TLDR: I slapped my girlfriend many times after she reminded me of being sexually assaulted and I feel so fucking terrible. I need professional help for controlling my anger management issues.

—

I have a girlfriend. We are both girls. We’ve been together for 3 years and 4 months. Shortly after we became official, I lied to her about my whereabouts because she didn’t like the people I was gonna meet. I didn’t like them either but I’ve already committed to going so I went. 

The people I was gonna meet were my highschool friends. Long story short, I sort of have an “utang na loob” that’s why I couldnt decline when they told me to treat them for my late birthday celebration. We drank and I had a bit too much and next thing I know, someone was behind me taking off my jeans. I don’t remember all the details, except that something terrible happened to me that night. I only confided about it to just one friend.

Four months later, my girlfriend was going through my phone and found out about it. She was angry, understandably. But I didn’t want to talk about it. I couldn’t bring myself to relive that trauma. I thought we were going to break up. But we didn’t. We stayed together. 

Fast forward to present, my girlfriend and I were drinking. Then we had a misunderstanding. She went to her room and I didn’t bother following. She’s drunk so I figured I’ll talk to her the day after when she’s sober. I was gonna sleep in the living room. 

After some time, she went out of her room and approached me, saying, “Hey, remember when you cheated on me?” I was confused and thought she was just joking. I asked, “wdym?” Then she brought that unfortunate event up. And I was like, “what? How is that cheating? How is being r*ped/sexually assaulted cheating?” 

She says it is cheating because I lied about where I was that day. She went back to her room and I followed angrily asking why would she want to remind me that night and make me relive the trauma. I asked what her point was. She said she never got over it because we never talked about it. I explained that I wasn’t ready to talk about it, that I tried so hard to forget it and that I didn’t want to remember any of it. I explained over and over but she just didn’t care. So I lost it. I slapped her, twice. Then she went as far as saying I went to my highschool friends willingly to get fucked. So I slapped her again. I didn’t know what happened to me. I’ve always known I had anger management issues. But I never laid my hands on her or anyone like that. I never slapped anyone that hard. 

After that, she told me to leave. She didn’t really have to. I was gonna leave. I was ashamed of what I did. 

I initially thought what I did was okay because she was provoking me and practically victim-blaming me for getting sexually assaulted. But that’s not an excuse. I physically abused her. It didn’t matter what’s the reason why I did it. I slapped my girlfriend and I feel like the most terrible person in the world. I immediately knew after that that there is no going back. I love her. I spent the last three years and 4 months of my life dedicating myself to her. We can’t be together anymore. She was emotionally abusing me and I ended up physically abusing her. The relationship was getting toxic. This is the end for us. 

I need help. I don’t know where to start or who to ask. I get mad often that I don’t know how to control it anymore. I don’t want to keep being like this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/uag5nf/i_slapped_my_girlfriend_i_need_help/,t2_cje6e14u,2022-04-24 06:12:50,7,4
How do I fix things?,"Hello, Mental Health PH! I've been wanting to ask help kasi hindi ko na rin alam 'yong gagawin ko. My boyfriend and I are trying to help each other pero we always fail. Whenever negative discussions arise and negative emotions are start to come out, he would flip out and lose control of his anger sa mundo. I would be the catch-basin for all of those emotions he has. Then, if I feel na napapagod ako, I would openly tell him about it but he would start to flip out uli and I would either get hurt physically kasi pipigilan ko siya magpakamatay out of anger or emotionally kasi he would tell me hurtful words that triggered my episodes na multiple times. How can I save him from committing suicide? How can I help myself?

To have more context, the reason why he is so full of anger is because he lives in an abusive household. We also had relationship issues before that made him mad pa lalo sa sarili niya because he did wrong things to me that aren't morally acceptable. As for me, I came from an abusive household too and nakaalis naman na ako from there. I live alone but I'm battling with Rheumatic Heart Disease, PTSD, OCD, and Tenosynovitis.

"Have you ever thought that therapy would fix everything, and it just hasn’t? And now you’re just more depressed","TW: suicidal thoughts, mentions of SA

I was really excited to start seeing a psychologist and psychiatrist because I’ve been having mental health problems since I was really young. I was in survival mode for most of my life, and honestly just clung on to the hope that everything would work out once I’m financially stable and could afford seeking professional help. I worked 1-2 jobs to put myself through school, then worked 16-hour days after I graduated to save up.

I started seeing a psychologist January of last year and a psychiatrist July of last year. I can’t say I’ve found someone that’s a good match for me yet. Meds didn’t really help? I’ve tried sertraline, escitalopram, aripiprazole, serotia. I’m currently on 75 mg lamictal (will add +25mg every 2 weeks) and haven’t seen much of a difference. I can’t say nagkulang ako with the work because I’ve done everything in my power for me to have a good life. And kahit wala akong emotional support I’ve sought mental health professionals and even spent a lot of time doing my own research. I have PTSD and just got diagnosed with BorderlinePD. I haven’t started DBT yet because I’m currently on a tight budget until January 2024.

I don’t think I can spend the rest of my life feeling this way. I’m really tired of trying to help myself. I’m honestly thinking if ending my life would be easier because I just don’t think it’s worth living this way. I can’t handle anyone saying life gets better because I’ve been waiting 26 years for life to get better, it hasn’t. I’ve never had a happy moment. I’ve went through physical and emotional abuse, sexual assault, neglect of basic necessities when I was a kid, and spent my teens and early 20s just working to survive. I’ve handled all of this alone. I’m sure I’m a strong person, but I just can’t take anymore of this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/17lu0h7/have_you_ever_thought_that_therapy_would_fix/,t2_ay3xacwt,2023-11-02 11:01:42,14,7
Dynamic Meditation benefits.,"So recently I've been practicing meditation as taught by Silva and as a side effect the first thing that got better was my mental health. I've been doing it for 6 months. 

As a background I have been depressed since I was 17, probably even longer than that as I remember I had thoughts of suicide even before that. I have autism which manifested in obsessive compulsive behaviours and thinking. I have, anger issues from trauma, difficulty focusing and when triggered I get uncontrolled thoughts of suicide. Grew up in an abusive home. I also have tons of physical health issues, digestive issues.

I found the program through a Facebook reel. Bhought the books, did the training found a mentor. 

My primary goal was healing my digestive issues so I was motivated. But what I discovered early on was as I meditated negative thoughts immediately vanished and I felt better mentally. Research shows that after 8 weeks of meditation, the brain physically changes and make it so that you are more resistant to stress. 

After a few weeks I no longer feel depressed or stressed. After a few months I feel full of life and positive about everything. 

Here's how it works, when we are in the awake level of mind our brain fires at 14-30 Hz per second. When we are awake (beta) the processes we need to survive in this world are firing at full blast. When our survival is at stake the wirings and programming can become convoluted, stress, trauma and various mental illness can manifest. This is not necessarily bad since it mainly does this to protect us.

When we go into alpha (meditation state) at about 7-14 Hz per second. All the processes that our body doesn't need to live are turned off. We go into  a relaxed state of mind. Stress, depression, negative thoughts all slowly go away. Meditation also act as a natural anti-depressant by promoting the release of the neurotransmitter serotonin.

After 8 weeks of meditation, scientists discovered the brain physically changes, it grows and is able to handle stress so much more. 

When we exercise, we rest our muscles so it can grow stronger. When our brain gets stressed we don't rest it, then it gets stressed, stressed, stressed and stressed. Then it doesn't grow. Meditation is rest for the brain. Once rested it gets stronger. 

For a small fee I can teach you the meditation method by Silva. If you can't afford it I'm still willing to teach, we can talk about it. This is not therapy, just a meditation class.

Is Self-Therapy A Thing?,"TW: Just random weird thoughts that's up to you to read it

I feel dead inside. As in dead like a zombie after abusing my ears due to my music addiction. A relapse last month was so bad I think I sabotaged my situationship/friendship with someone that almost ""lose my mind"" kahit hindi naman.

I cried and cried blaming myself I'm the problem why not relationships last. I cannot enjoy going to places and events, I stopped buying event tickets because someone never bought it (a joy buyer/reserver since she's a UST student). After sharing to her the breakdown if she wants to buy my physical ticket, she just ghosted me and idk if I was persistent to send her messages on Messenger. I considered it as a trauma and decided to plan myself ahead that I wanted to throw my other tickets and pins due to my anger issues. Kasi wala nabili and if you were in my shoes nakakadismaya even for a cheap price. I felt that for the one staff who gave me the wrong ticket, I should have at least shouted at your ear to hear it property. F*ck!

Then I felt it's much more better to vent it in a notepad kasi nakakagigil sobra.

I also got trauma for being alone because I felt someone is following me. Hindi biro na ilang beses ako nagdeact ng social media accounts even I feel triggered and yet kinakaya ko when I feel down and scared.

Probably in the future if may pera lang talaga ako magtry ako ng either counselling or therapy pero hahanap ako ng mas babagay sa akin na makakausap ko.

This relative of mine is not helping. She has become too emotionally and mentally draining for me.

Just 30 mins ago, she’s berating me over a menial thing. As in turning the lights off when I wake up. She even reached the point of verbally saying that she will kill me. I have become too disrespectful daw. She will kill me because I simply answered her with, “I just woke up.”

I cannot leave the house just yet.

I am trying my best to be strong for myself. If I let her break me, then what will become of me?

"Of admission, guilt, and being broken","I just had a really bad breakdown a few weeks ago. It was so bad that I  finally realized and accepted something I have always disregarded for years - that I needed help. 

I didn't know where to start, who to go to, who to speak to, where to ask for help. I found this thread and posted about asking for help under my old account. It took me a week to even try. But I did, I got myself signing up for NCMH's e-consultation and just waiting for them to reply back. Hooray for my first step, right?

But no, I don't feel happy or proud of myself. I feel anxious and scared because getting help means talking, and talking means admitting, and admitting means recounting all the steps that led me towards this black hole that I'm drowning in. 

I don't know how I would deal with myself once I find out if I really have depression or if I'm just a really bad person. It's hard enough to admit that there's something wrong with you, but it's harder to admit that there's something mentally and medically wrong with you (getting officially diagnosed means my problem gets validated. I don't believe in self-diagnosis.) 

But getting diagnosed means that one day I have to tell this to my family. And I have to tell them why it lead to this.

How do I tell them it started with my mom's mental and physical abuse? 

How do I forgive myself knowing that I hated her for it?

How do I live with myself now that I found out that her abuse came from her own depression because of my father's repeated infidelity?

How do I live with the fact that my beloved father was not the man I thought he was?

How do I live with myself and admit that I'm broken when my family shuns the idea of depression?

I know that it's a good thing that I'm starting to accept, to realize, and to admit that there's something wrong with me. But I don't know how to walk this path when I know it's going to be full of thorns.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/n6xofw/of_admission_guilt_and_being_broken/,t2_99bhfjq7,2021-05-07 20:47:03,3,3
I want to share the effects of childhood trauma,"Hello, I will not be saying anything about my identity or any of my families. 

When I was three my parents broke up, my mom left my father for another man. I didn’t know this at the time and was too young to understand. 

When I was four my mother got a boyfriend, he had a daughter (age 7) we got along. Later on that year, my mother fainted do to her disease. I was scared. An ambulance was called and she was rushed to the hospital. Through that time I kept my calm, as a four year old little girl. 

Later on, when I was six, my mother divorced my father. She got full custody. During that year my father started doing substances. I didn’t see him for a year. That whole time my mother talked bad about him when I cried. 

When I was seven I couldn’t feel happiness anymore. I didn’t tell anyone and just laid in my bed on my phone all day. 

When I was eight I went to a guidance counselor for the first time. I talked about how my grandfather punched my brother in the face, and how I was scared with him living with my dad (my dad stopped doing substances when I was 7) 

When I was nine my mother got a new boyfriend, he had four kids and had 50/50 custody over them. They fought 24/7. That’s when I started having anxiety really bad. 

When I was ten my mom got a different boyfriend. I never had the care I needed. My mother would still get child support but would spend it all on medical weed.

When I finally turned eleven the school noticed. They asked my mom if I could see the school psychologist. She said yes and the first time I went they talked about anxiety. I took test and found out I had anxiety, depression, and anger issues.

All of this has troubled me to this day. All the physical, verbal, and mental abuse. So pls take care of your children",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/17k6qam/i_want_to_share_the_effects_of_childhood_trauma/,t2_m1amhqonf,2023-10-31 07:17:36,6,1
I [F26] think my mother [F52] is a narcissist,"I recently got my diagnosis for autism and, last year, for ADHD. I'm taking three medications at the moment. One for depression, one for my anxiety and one for my ADHD. I am also planning to go to therapy for my ASD.

Ever since, as long as I can remember, my mom demanded so much of me. Kasalanan ko kasi maipanganak, so I have to pay the price by becoming great. I was given all the opportunities that my parents weren't able to receive when they were younger (proper education, full meals, decent clothing, complete books and school supplies, pocket money, etc.), so they expected that I could achieve far greater heights. Kaso ayun nga, I didn't.

I was *not putting all the deets bec very triggering basta very chaotic and self damaging*.

I fought my way to where I am right now in my mental health. My father has been reluctant at first pero super supportive and understanding na siya ngayon. I can see him doing his best talaga even if he had his shortcomings in the past from how he behaved.

Pero my mom.......

It's like she takes all the opportunities talaga to use my weaknesses against me. Lagi niya sinasabi ""bakit ako, kami ng mga kapatid ko, wala naman kaming gamot pero okay naman kami."" Which is false btw, she and all of her siblings have difficulty addressing their concerns due to how they were raised by my lolo.

Her favorite one so far is ""walang magtatagal sa'yo, lahat ng tao iiwan ka.""

She just knows how to hit me hard eh. I had a long term ex boyfriend who I had an on and off relationship for eight years and she knew kasi na lagi ako iniiwan.

Other signs din eh nakikita ko like she has one sided view of everything. Kapag may mali any person in our family, no matter what the reason kahit valid, hindi niya kaya magextend ng understanding. Pero kapag siya nagkamali, kailangan nagets na namin kaagad na tao siya.

Lahat utang na loob pa sa kanya. Number 1 red flag sa amin ng kapatid ko ever since childhood yung kunwari ""ililibre"" niya daw kami pero ibabawas na pala sa allowance namin na binibigay ng tatay namin. Which is btw enough lang ha kasama na yung mga biglaang projects doon. Pero nababawasan pa dahil sa kanya dati. I just learned overtime na wag na maniwala sa kanya.

Tapos ang hilig niya sa ""bakit ako +insert something na worse nangyari sa kanya pero hindi siya naging ganon"" whenever may tao pinaguusapan na dumaan sa something at naging for example slut, drug addict, etc.

Lagi din siya naooffend kapag magbibigay siya advice tapos di namin susundin. Naooffend din siya kapag may susuotin kami na ayaw niya yung style (pahirapan pa para masunod yung gusto namin).

Hilig din niya daanin sa physical abuse kapag nagmemake sense mga sinasabi namin. Lalo na nung bata ako. Ngayon kasi kaya ko na tumakbo at makaalis. Nung bata ako, literal na bata ako.

Tapos kapag nagoopen up siya kailangan pakinggan ko siya. Kapag di ko siya pinakinggan magtethreat siya na sige hindi na daw siya magoopen up.

Tapos pinaka malala dati yung inakusahan ako ng sarili kong nanay na- (gusto ko sana iopen up dito kaso masyadong below the belt, basta sexual and incest thing) dahil lang nagbibigay sa akin tatay ko ng allowance directly. Hindi na dinadaan sa kanya kasi financially manipulative siya :((

Ang dami pa, eh. The list goes on. Wala pa diyan yung public humiliation na hilig niya gawin sa amin.

Ayun lang. Nahihirapan lang talaga ako. Naiiyak nalang ako kasi need ko talaga help pero yung mom ko, feel ko hindi ako maghiheal kapag nasa iisang lugar ako kung nasaan siya :((",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/17w2mt8/i_f26_think_my_mother_f52_is_a_narcissist/,t2_ksq1i4a2,2023-11-16 04:17:00,2,6
Enablers,"I’m a domestic violence survivor and now they still hunt me

Bakit may mga taong sila na nga yung may kasalanan or may nagawang mali tapos sila pa yung may lakas ng loob magparinig at manlait? Hi, call me A and I’m a victim of domestic violence. I’ll make this story short na lang. 

7 years kami ng ex ko. I was physically and mentally abused. May anak kami. Di nya sinustentuhan at hindi niya sinusustentuhan. I tried asking for help sa barangay, nagharap kami don and he agreed na magbigay ng 1k per month para sa anak naming may special needs (Yes my son is PWD. And so am I. Pero later ko na explain). Nagstart naman siya magbigay ng “ 500” a month lol but after ilang buwan nagstop na. So sabi ko ok mukhang ayaw talaga. Wag na pilitin.

What I bother the most is yung family niya, his current live-in-partner and yung friends ni ate girl. Kasi grabe po sila mang bully sa akin. Panay parinig, and kung makalait sila sa appearance and weight ko. Ang lala. Pinagtutulungan nila ako even the friends ng gf ng ex ko na hindi naman ako kilala. 

I have depression and anxiety disorder and 3 years nako nagtetake ng meds for it. dahil nga don sa nangyari sa akin na ginawa ng ex ko.

Until now ayaw nila ako patahimikin. Sometimes, naiisip ko nang gümawa ng masama sakanila dahil sukdulan na galit at sama ng oob ko sakanila.

Just need to vent (having lifecrisis atm),"Di ko alam paano sisimulan to but my life is basically shit and meaningless. Broken family (physically abusive dad that used to hurt my mom—not in contact with him anymore), nanay na kasabay magmature (ngayon ngayon lang nagmamature ata?), she had many exes na foreigner and hopefully yung bf niya ngayon magtagal na sila. I stopped college kasi ghinost ako ng tatay ko, pinaaral niya ko sa feu pero hindi na tinuloy pagbabayad. I feel like all the problems in the world is sitting right on my shoulders and wala ako magawa. 

I’m currently burn out as a freelancer artist who does character designs. Dati ako nagaaral ng multimedia arts and since nagstop nga ako, di ko na napagaralan yung advanced subjects na required para sa pagiging graphic designer (which yung in ngayon). Nagtry na ko magcall center nung summer pero puro rejected (kind of lucky kasi ayoko talaga magcall center ever, hindi ko pinangarap para sa sarili ko yun), also tried applying for webtoon companies but also rejected. I still have a few commissions left to do pero last na to and wala na kong clients. I’m also broke with 0 money.


Naiinggit lang ako sa mga kabatchmates ko nung college na may proper job na ngayon and earning their own money. Samantalang ako pag pumasok balik freshman kasi di credited mga subjects ko. I’m already 24 this year. I feel so hopeless and may balak pa nanay ko na sumama sa boyfriend niya sa australia, iiwan niya ko dito but she promised papadalan niya kami ng allowance lagi. I’m an only child and di ko pa din magets hanggang ngayon bakit hindi niya ko nasuportahan ng maayos dati. This year nga lang siya nagkatrabaho sa call center kasi ang tamad niya. 

Everytime magoopen up ako sa kaniya saying na nagkakacrisis ako kasi di ko makita future ko, parang pinaparating niya na bahala na ko sa sarili ko kasi 24 na ko. Ngayon may utang pa ko sa FEU na 55k na dapat binayaran ng tatay ko, so kahit gusto ko lumipat sa mas murang college I can’t kasi yung documents ko nasa FEU. 

Di ko alam kung tamang subreddit ba pinagventan ko pero I just feel hopeless. Everyday nasa bahay lang ako with same routine over and over again, gagawin commissions then play videogames or watch something, eat, then sleep.

"To people who grew up without a parent/sibling emotionally/physically present, How are you?","To people who grew up without a parent/sibling emotionally/physically present, How are you?

Ako I would tear up, feel sad, or trigger an episode whenever I would think about having a parent. 

How does it feel growing up having a father/mother figure?
How does it feel having a parent telling you na they're proud of you? How does it feel hugging your mom/dad?
How does it feel ranting to your parents?
How does it feel to have a ""Kuya"" who can protect you?

I grew up with maids. I never heard any life lessons nor tips from my parents. I don't remember anything tbh. I have this void/emptiness and always yearning for a parent's love.

Hearing ""Anak I'm proud of you"" would melt my heart. I would probably cry within seconds.

Whenever a friend would pat my head, I would melt. Like, I would be so thankful with that small gesture and would make me happy. Thankful ako sa mga tao/friends ko who treated me as their sister. (It's not a flirty gesture para sakin) Mostly maaapreciate ko kasi kahit seconds lang, naeexperience ko.

Fyi, my parents and siblings arent dead. Parents are busy with work ever since. My mom is mostly absent. While my Dad naing househusband and present physically since highschool but he's emotionally abusive and would always threaten us (kids) 🫠 Mom didn't correct him nor comment on how he controls/lectures us. While with my siblings, well they gave me trauma when we were kids. (Hindi ko na babanggitin kung ano basta I could file a case lol) so ayun... no emotional connection as well. They would just use the word ""kapatid mo ko tas ganyan ka"" like wtf dudeeeee baka nakakalimutan mong may atraso ka sakin???

I am at my Lola's house here kasama ko po ang Tita at Tito ko and their children. 

I need help because of my abusive guardians here, since I was a child they were already abusive pero when my mom went abroad to work that's were lumala po lahat. They were ordering me around an parang katulong lang po ako, They barely feed me, they have been verbally and physically assaulting me. Like every little thing I do jinujudge nila. It came to the point kanina lang na they were really shouting at me that they wanted to kill me and.. I got scared that's why I decided to find help online here on Reddit, since if sa twitter or facebook ako nagpost makikita nila. I thought of going to the police pero I don't have any proof na inaabuse nila ako since I always get scared whenever they get mad at me. Ano po pwede ko pong gawin? I feel like my mental health is deteriorating.

dark poetry,"The presence of my demon in the mirror draws nearer

I feel sympathy for those exposed, battle-worn eyes

Purpose for my descension and ascension became clearer

It’s a symphony orchestra when the battle horn cries

I learned my words touch souls

Dispersed across the world

Childhood pain metamorphed into a passion

We would play the game Duck Hunt

Then a game under the covers

Innocence shifted in a way I couldn’t fathom

Back in the early nineties

Sister was 5 and I was 3

Babysitter on the bed spread

Spreadin one cheek west and one cheek east

No physical harm caused

We just stared alarmingly

Tried coaxing us a couple times

Said to let our garments free

Sis and I were with our mom one night

Mustered up courage and started to speak

He seemed so friendly and neighborly 

Acted charismatic, charming as could be

Parents geared up for a fucking war

Only thing missing were the army fatigues

Twenty one, living with his aunt and uncle

He too was toyed with as a youth

The cycle continues to perpetuate 

That doesn’t make it an excuse

I’ve read that 1 in 13 boys go through

Some form of child sexual abuse

Worse for girls, it’s 1 in 4

And we’re expected to not grow up so confused?

Are all these underlying issues 

The reason why I live like a recluse?

Hard to fit into society

It’s easier fitting into a noose 

Maybe I’ll give a try at sobriety 

Prayers are the only thing that can get me through",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/xg69bu/dark_poetry/,t2_dxw73cb0,2022-09-17 07:23:16,2,7
I feel like I am the reason why my younger cousins are mentally unstable,"5 years old ako nung nag decide si mama na its better if wala ako sakanya at nasa kapatid niya ako for a better future. 

My aunt was nice. She can even be noted by everyone as the nicest person you'll meet. She treated me as her own, made sure I studied in private schools, got my need and wants provided.  And so on and so forth. 

Pero tao lang din siya, may flaw. Yung flaw niyang yon? Namimisikal siya and passive agressive siya everytime na maiinis or magagalit siya. Since she is earning big, and i was ""responsible"" at a young age at dahil babae ako, I was forced to learn how to clean the house, cook for everyone, and take care of my cousins. Hindi pa uso ang gentle parenting noon, kaya lahat passive agrresive. Worst na yung physical and verbal abuse kada mag kakamali para ""magtanda"". At dahil wala naman akong ibang alam kung pano mag handle ng ganong kadaming bata at a young age. Ang hostile ng way kung pano ko sila pakisamahan, laging aggresive kasi that time akala ko yun yung tama. And dahil dito, I was so furious, angry, and confused when my aunt weren't even raise or hit them everytime na may susuway sakanya. Making me feel angrier and being hostile towards everyone. 

My attitude went on until pandemic. Noong mga panahon na yun naging hot topic sa social media how mental health is important lalo na we were in isolation. I went on to read and watch videos kung about the topic and went to realize how my actions towards my cousins are beyond fuxked. 

After realizing that, I started getting myself better. I stopped hitting and being aggresive to them. But the damage is already done. 

Last week, I overheard my cousins talking sa kwarto ng anak ni tita. I never meant to eavesdrop, hahayaan ko na silang magkaroon ng privacy kung ano man pinag uusapan nila. But I listened kasi na mention bigla yung pangalan ko. In their they talked how they don't want to hang out with me anymore or have me in their space kasi ang ginagawa ko lang daw sakanila ay magalit or sigawan sila. Their conversation went on under the same topic, I went away quickly once na realized ko na I fuxked up big time and maybe even contributed why they feel less confident than before. 

I projected how I was raised sakanila and now they are in pain because of this.

I don't really know what to do. I am trying my best to be better and interact with them with gentleness pero with this in mind, lalo lang ako nahihirapan and nag s spiral lang lalo.

I really need an advice kasi na c consume na niya badly yung mental health ko and i don't know what to do or approach things...",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/18t0jbz/i_feel_like_i_am_the_reason_why_my_younger/,t2_kaj7a5gdm,2023-12-29 02:16:08,4,2
Mental Health Facility with pick up service,"Hello. Do you know of any mental health facility that offers pick up services?  My schizo-bipolar brother is acting up again. He refuses to take his meds and is just a pain to live with.  He is very toxic always shouting, cursing, making a mess everywhere and locks the gates all the time because he is too paranoid.  He terrorized our helper.  He did not hurt her physically but he said mean things to her, emotionally abused and even took out her bed and locked her out of the house.  
I really need him to be picked up and sent to a facility because he does not listen to anyone and just creates chaos at home. I have been very patient with him and trying to talk to him calmly to ask if he could take his meds or to try to not make a mess, but he always snaps. I am losing my mind dealing with him.

Please help. How can I get him into a facility?",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/st9yns/mental_health_facility_with_pick_up_service/,t2_7aexfplt,2022-02-16 02:41:18,1,9
Maglalayas ako.,"I'm in need of serious advice ng mga kailangan kong gawin at mga dapat ko tandaan. Huwag niyo na sanang subukang baguhin isip ko, salamat.

Reason:

Matagal ko nang pinagiisipan 'to, ilang buwan na rin halos kaya ilalagay ko lahat ng reason.
Nakatira ako ngayon kasama ang mommy ko and second husband nya. Magkakasama rin kami rito ng mga kapatid ko at mga anak niya with the second husband. Everything would seem fine if pipilitin nating huwag pagtuunan ng pansin na I was sexually assaulted by my step-father months ago, my mother knew yet wala siyang ginawa kundi igaslight ako na i was just being sensitive, and it's my fault daw because I sleep nang nakasando at shorts lang, (I have my own room and ang ginawa ng stepdad ko eh pinapasok ako sa kuwarro habang tulog at hinihipuan ako.) 
Also, my mom and stepdad is physically and verbally abusive. There were days were they would punch in the face, bang her head sa pader, and choke my older sister (with severe autism) with pillow while telling her na they want to kill her for doing something not very 'normal' for them.
Hindi ko sila ma expose kasi may pagkapavictim silang dalawa at napakamanipulative. 

 they both verbally abused me together with my younger brother na disabled (no read no write, cant walk, partly blind, cant speak) my mom would tell us that she's cursed, and that she hopes di nalang kami naging anak niya. 



Today's the last straw: my mom got mad at my older sister for cussing so she decided to beat her up again for hours to the point that my sister were begging her to stop. After non, pinalayas niya yung older sister ko (ngayon na nasa lola ko na) 



I've always been patient with them kasi wala na akong mapuntahan, my biological father does the same thing to us kaya di namin siya pwedeng lapitan. Yung lola ko naman eh walang pera para tustusan kami. Nagaaral ako kaya natagalan bago ako nakapagdecide ng ganito kasi gusto ko magtapos para makuha ko mga kapatid ko kaso hindi ko na kayang intindihin pa mga ginagawa nila samin. Laging tinatry kong isipin na kaya ganyan si mama kasi very abusive din ang tatay niya pero I can only understand so much, I can only be patient for a while. 

Mayroon naman akong ipon, iniisip ko lang paano na pagaaral, anong trabaho papasukin at pano ako makakausad nang hindi ako babalik sa bahay na to unless when it's time for me to get my brother na.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/jc7zr5/maglalayas_ako/,t2_8i3wfu83,2020-10-16 19:16:43,39,19
"I need help. At this point idk where to start, but I just know I need help. And a lot of it.","Title says it all, itll be too long and conversational to put in just one post and at this point, everything overwhelms me. Right now I just need someone to guide me to the nearest hospital or smthng in manila that currently accepts IRL appointments (i hate video chat sessions with a passion) as I am in both incredible mental and physical pain from everything ive been going thru. To summarize my problem: I am in urgent need of emotional, financial and whatever support its called where I need a pet friendly place to live separate from my abusive household. As I cant do much as an unemployed first year college student who is quite literally stuck in a dead end no matter what I choose to do. I would be glad to tell my entire story if anyone were to give me some form of helpful support.

I'm the one who got frustrated with my Psychiatrists/Psychologists. A more detailed post on why,"I posted the thread below a day ago and some might assume I only had 1 session with these mental health professionals. I had my first session last January 2022, and the longest I've been with a mental health professional is 8 months, no improvement. I'd like to share my experience with past MH professionals and why I'm so damn frustrated. I don't really care if no one reads this but I feel like I need to vent.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/17azil2/why\_do\_ph\_psychiatristspsychologists\_instantly/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/17azil2/why_do_ph_psychiatristspsychologists_instantly/)

Psychologist 1 - *4 sessions for almost 2 months*

* I think this is the only psychologist in the province I lived in before (or the only one I could search anyway). Lots of red flags in the first meeting. I told her I was agnostic and she told me she understands but hopes I would see that a god exists. Asked my salary and told me to invest it in the place she was investing her money (won't mention where). I didn't say my true salary and straight up wanted to leave. Told me to definitely not take medication. The last straw was when I told her I was sexually assaulted as a kid and she told me I was still lucky I wasn't r4ped. That that must be why I was stable(??) because I wasn't r4ped. Told her that's not luck, that should be the norm. And thinking that way is enabling the future generation to normalize r4pe. I didn't go to another psychologist until a year later because I was afraid all psychologists were like that but it was probably just the culture in my province where everyone has no boundaries and imposes their religious beliefs on a daily basis. I shouldn't have expected a lot for 500php/hr anyway.

Psychologist 2 - *Probably 5 sessions over the course of a few months. I forgot because I wasn't the consistent*

* Online consultations. Kind of liked her but there were times I didn't (I think those were the times I was splitting. Should have been a sign I had BorderlinePD). I just remembered she was the one who told me to consider if I had bipolar disorder. Didn't go back because I felt F2F consults were better because I was already at my apartment 24/7 (I WFH).

Psychiatrist 1 - *8 months. Once or twice a month*

* Initally diagnosed me with MDD and PTSD (I agree with the PTSD). I waited for the meds to take effect for months but constantly said I didn't feel anything changing. I told my family history (bio dad is diagnosed psychopath, grandfather has hallucinations and paranoia relating to hallucinations and is also violent, half-sister is neurodivergent. they never got any medical help btw even with those diagnosis) but was not diagnosed with anything else. I also told her I had violent tendencies (when I was alone) like thrashing my stuff and daydreamed about ways to harm people and how they could die (this was for people who've harmed me. I acknowledge that's not a good reason to wish ill of them). I get angry at the smallest things and would cut people off when they said one thing I didn't like. This was true even on meds. I also said a whole host of symptoms that I now know are symptoms of BorderlinePD but I don't think she took me seriously. She prescribed me a medication (still for MDD I think) that she said was addictive and I said that might be a problem because I have substance abuse issues. She told me to just control my dosage. That's not how addiction works. There were times where nagchchika nalang siya sa sessions about things I think didn't relate to my mental health anymore. Treatment plan never changed even though I constantly said I still feel the same. Just upped my dosage to the max possible for MDD. After 8 months, I didn't think I could spend any more money with no improvement. I don't think she's a bad psych but I guess just not the right fit for me and my mental disorders. I just stopped my meds cold turkey and didn't feel any changes or withdrawal symptoms, so I can probably say it didn't have any effect on me.

Psychiatrist 2 - *1 session*

* Prescribed valproic acid which aggregates PCOS and alters thyroid function. Asked if I should get myself checked first because I didn't know if I had PCOS or abnormal thyroid hormone levels and had no way to know about family's medical history but she just said to not worry lalo na I'm still young. I still got myself checked and just didn't go back kasi I wanted F2F na.

Psychiatrist 3 - *Will have my 2nd session this week.*

Now, I've looked forward to getting mental help as early as elementary. I spent a few years living in a domestically violent household, and spent the next decade living in between relatives who weren't physically abusive, but were verbally abusive and neglected me to the point where a lot of times I didn't have food and no one took care of me when I got sick (no meds, no food). I self-supported myself to finish college so finances have always been tight. A lot of times I wanted to kill myself. A lot of times I hurt myself. I stuck it out because I always told myself everything would be better once I'm financially stable and able to get help. I spent the first few years working multiple part-time jobs on top of my full-time job to save up. I was really excited to finally get some mental health help and now I'm just frustrated I'm not making any progress. I've finally got some sort of financial stability (the thing I said would make me happy) and I just feel nothing. Everything that happened to me finally caught up to me and I'm feeling the anger, sadness and resentment all at once. I don't have constant emotional support so I was betting my life on psychotherapy and meds saving me. I do try to function every day. I work, go to the gym, try to eat right, pay my bills on time, etc. I struggle to get up every day, but I do try. But when I don't have work I just cry and binge eat and think about dying. I'm 26 now, but I feel like I've lived 50 years. I don't think I can live the rest of my life like this.

I think I'll be booking a session with Doc Mariano. She's out of my price range but I heard she's the best. And I think I need the best for me to even have a shot at getting better.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/17c3fa2/im_the_one_who_got_frustrated_with_my/,t2_l0bssk5da,2023-10-20 13:10:50,4,3
I need a place to let this out.,"TRIGGER WARNING: trauma, SA, rape, suicidal ideation.

I'm a nurse, but I don't know if I will ever be mentally stable enough again to do the job I once loved.

In 2020, I was assaulted by a patient with COVID in the US. He trapped me in the room and I was scared for my life. This was after my doctor told me Kung sakali magkacovid ako mamatay ako. 

The assault opened old trauma Para sakin na matagal ko na tinatago. When I was very young I was sexually abused , humiliated, and bullied. Multiple times, by different people, throughout my life. 

Everytime pumapasok ako sa work, ang taas ng anxiety ko. I feel the trauma in my body, nahihilo ako, nasusuka, nag papalpitate Yung puso ko.

I tried working in different hospitals, pero wala din. Anything related sa nursing. Covid. the pandemic. Na titirigger ako. Konting stress lang, natititrigger ako.

Napakahirap mag hanap ng tulong. Sometimes the wait sa US is 6months to 1 year.Mahal pa ang therapy. Na bankrupt ako. Na bankrupt ako dahil sa sakit ko, dahil hindi ko tlga macontrol ang sarili ko.

I don't know if what I had was mania/psychosis/ hyperactivity, pero when I was not on my medicine and not in therapy I really put myself in danger. I could not control my impulses, it was like someone else was in the driver's seat and I just watched. I wasn't sleeping and that made me so much worse. I let strangers sexually abuse me without protection, with out thinking  of the consequences. I harmed my body, I ruined my career. I ruined myself financially, and I'm in so much debt I might go to prison.

I put all my dirty laundry on social media because of my poor impulse control.

I lost all my friends, at least the ones I made the 7 years ako nag trabaho sa US. 

I lost my hard earned money from poor choices.

I was moving faster than I was thinking, because of the trauma.

And because I was desperately trying to cope, and had poor coping mechanisms, I just inflicted more pain and more trauma to myself.

I feel so hopeless. 
There became two parts to me:

One part who wants to live but does not know how. 

And the other part who just wants to give up and die.

Everyday I fight Intrusive, ""outside"" thoughts, that's that are in my head but are not me (I hope that makes sense): to hurt myself, to kill myself.

Because I am such a worthless person for allowing these terrible things to happen to me.
For being so stupid. I feel like I'm completely broken and I cannot be repaired. I am ruined in every way imaginable and I'm so toxic now that I've pushed the other people in my life so far away. 

I don't really know who I am if I cannot be a nurse anymore. It took alot of hard work to get my license and to be mentally well enough to care for others... and then everything just came undone....

I'm here in the Philippines, with my parents, because I cannot even take care of myself anymore. I forget to eat, forget to take my meds.

It's hard for me to find a provider I can trust here in the Philippines, and I really need help. I haven't been mentally stable enough to work since October. 

I've endured so much trauma, I feel it physically in the form of pain. My body is always in trauma mode. Everything hurts. My neck, back, pelvis.

I need to find someone who's been through something like this. I need to know how they moved on because I cannot. I don't know how to do that. I don't know how to just let go of this pain. :( 

I was admitted to the hospital multiple times. Had several different therapist until I could find someone I can trust. They gave me so many diagnosis pero it's so frustrating because one would say I have something and another would completely deny it. It's so much gaslighting and mistrust. They gave me the most stigmatizing diagnoses first, like borderline personality disorder and bipolar disorder.

Ang kami nilang binigay na diagnosis pero I feel like I'm not on the right treatment path--- theres a missing piece na hindi pa naadress. 

I don't know what my problem really is, and I wish I just knew how to break the cycle that keeps happening.

Everytime something bad happens, no matter how big or small, my automatic thought is ""I should just kill myself.""

I am so ashamed of myself. 

I am ashamed I cannot be a normal adult.

I cannot even look at myself or be around people anymore.

I just needed a place to say this... and I really appreciate you taking the time to read it.

Does my older Brother have mental disorder?,"my old brother is 30 years old, maybe got a job once then quit, it took him more than a decade to finish college, switch between courses, his not academically smart I would say, probably doesn’t know what he wants in life, his living off with parents support all this time.. pandemic he goes out everyday in the neighborhood playing pool, drinking, beaching, and would come home later in the evening, of course this creates conflict between him and father so there is arguments all night long... 

I’ve been living with depression and this does not help me, it triggers my anxiety which is the main cause of my concern about the situation. I can’t go anywhere because of the travel res & honestly I’m already too tired to even move

I keep thinking mental disorder runs in the family, parents separated, mother moved abroad  more than a decade and has since seen her twice during the period, quite controlling, father mentally and physically abusive when we were a child/teenage and maybe got PTSD since he’s an ex military, I remember him quite aloof and anxious when I was young, I grew up with parents arguing everyday hence the separation ...

Running away at 19,"Is it possible to run away at 19 and live on my own in this country? I’m supposed to be in the 12th grade, but my mom’s lost her job and will return to the PH this August. I have social anxiety depression and I’ve been clinically diagnosed with it last 2017, but she put the therapy and medication to a halt when I started not going to school again because–– guess what–– I’m fucking depressed. I want to fucking run away because she’s abusive, and has abused me as a child. Both physically and emotionally. Not only her, but everyone else in my household as well.

Lowkey na ligaw,"Hi, it's my first time sharing here on reddit. Recently, I don't do hangouts with my college friends a lot right now including that person. That person is a lesbian. Don't get me wrong ah. Di ako homophobic. Wala sa plano ko talaga mag jowa dahil nagtanda ako sa abusive ex ko na nakapag trigger ng bipolar affective disorder ko. About my condition, I was diagnosed since 2021. 

So start tayo sa story, kaklase ko siya since 3 semester until now. Extrovert siya at halos lahat nakakausap niya including school staffs and professors. Actually goods siya at wala akong masabi sa kabaitan niya like tinutulungan niya mga kaklase namin academically and financially. 

Last 2 sem umamin siya na may gusto siya sa akin and before that may kaklase kami na pumo porma sa akin. I rejected my classmate saka siya nag confess sa akin. Alam niya yun dahil nasa loob siya ng circle of friends. My response naman sa pag amin niya is ""Ayoko ng mga ganyan. Mas goods na kaibigan lang tayo."". That time kasi na stress ako sa pumoporma sa akin dahil possessive at selosa kahit wala naman kami. So ayun nga nagkaroon na kami ng pagkakasundo about friendship and my boundaries when it comes sa romantic relationships. 

Naging maganda pagkakaibigan namin until nitong Monday lang. I was talking about my preferences sa mga ideal partner ko. Nag joke pa ako na pag umibang bansa ka hanapan mo ako ng boylet. Pero sabi niya, ""Huwag magwawala ako."" Hanggang sa napunta sa physical appearance na gusto ko sa lalaki. It's also my preference kung anong nakakapag attract sa akin. Lagi niyang sinasabi na ""red flag"" yung gusto ko. Sa isip isip ko kasi, ano bang gusto niya mag jowa ako ng panget? And what lalaitin niya gaya ng panlalait niya ng sobra sa ex ko based on his appearance? Di ko dini defend yung ex ko pero everytime na pinag uusapan namin yung standard at preference ko sa lalaki laging may kontra.

Ang dami ko nang sinasabi na di ko siya gusto. Tas nirelpyan ko siya, ""Bakit yung mga tropa natin sinusuportahan mo sa mga relationship nila pero bakit sakin hindi?"" Like paano na lang if nakahanap na ako ng relationship? Tas mababadtrip siya? Ginawa niya yun eh nung nagkagusto ako sa kasama ko sa chorale. 

Ang ginawa ko na lang ngayon is lumayo ako at di ko na siya pinapansin dahil nabadtrip ako sa kaniya. If ever na i approach ako edi kakausapin ko. Back from the start, ita trato ko siya bilang kaklase. Kahit papaano di ko kakalimutan lahat ng kabutihan niya sa akin. It's just that the more na magiging close kami the more mapu fall siya ng malala. Di ko intensyon manakit ng feelings. I just want to live my life alone and enjoy things to get healed. May priority ako sa buhay at ayoko munang haluin ng love life kasi para sa akin mas nakaka stress magka love life kesa mag aral.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/19eavmw/lowkey_na_ligaw/,t2_sf90g70h,2024-01-24 14:41:40,1,1
Where can I find a free or affordable child psychologist?,"My little sister (12 years old) has been expressing suicidal tendencies for a while now. Aside from that, she has also expressed wanting to kill me or my father. She has also physically hurt us for a while.

Although I am not condoning my sister's actions, I know for a fact that a lot of her behavior stems from the verbal and psychological abuse my father has shown towards us for years now, that's why I want to seek help for her as soon as possible for her to avoid hurting us or herself.

Magiging single mom na ako,"Hello. Not sure if this is a rant but I would also appreciate your insights and help. I am married to an abusive husband. Before, I was constantly physically hurt by him even during my pregnancy and after my miscarriage. Now, he's hurting me in a different way. 

We've been together for almost 10 years na rin. I said 'before' yung pananakit nya dahil hindi na nya ulit ginawa since the pandemic started. But his physical violence towards me made me feel worthless and devalued over the years, at parang I have trauma sa mga nangyari, added to my childhood issues (which is another story) only made me feel worse. But he said he changed for the family, he showed (or deceived?) me his changed ways, and my fault that I thought I could trust him with my mental health issues. Bakit sya? My parents are not supportive at sabi nagiinarte lang ako; my friends are busy with their own lives. Kaya I told him what I feel, na I am no longer sad, but more of empty. I told him my most sacred secrets about my feelings, my current disposition, my suicidal tendencies. He promised to never tell anyone. I was wrong to think they were safe with him.

Normal ang away sa mag-asawa, pero hindi normal na dinamay nya pati in-laws ko sa mga away namin. Hindi pa kulang na nageeskandalo sya sa buong village kada away, he would call his family para marinig nila ang away namin (on their end, talagang di nila binababa ang call for hours para makinig or makichismis sa away namin mag-asawa huh). And there he broke his promise and spilled everything I told him. Nasasaktan ako sa betrayal na ginawa nya. I've been through so much. Hindi ko na kaya tiisin pa ang marriage namin.

Bakit hindi ako nakipaghiwalay noon pa? Dahil iniisip ko ang anak ko, dahil hindi ako financially capable pa noon, dahil akala ko magbabago sya, dahil ayaw ng both sides of our families na maghiwalay kami. Pero mas matibay na loob ko ngayon na hiwalayan sya. Now, I am scared of what might happen next. I will move out with my child kahit na bahay ng parents ko to (they don't want to kick him out) but after that, what do I do? Saan kami pupunta? Ano pang dapat gawin ko? I am doing my best to move forward alone with my child, kaysa magsuicide at maiwanan ang bata.

My sister needs help,"This is going to be a long one but for anybody who reads this entire thing, thank you so much in advance. My sister (21) is in a dark place. We grew up in a nice neighborhood in the suburbs, parents divorced. Since she graduated high school in 2020 she hasn’t had a job and my mom gives her money, how much? I don’t know. My mom is afraid to take the keys to her car, take her phone. Last night she got extremely mad at me and broke something in my room, I lost my shit and told her to clean it up. Anyway she told my mom last night that she’s ready to end her life. This isn’t the first time she’s said something scary lately. My poor mom cannot make her do anything, she’s completely out of control. Completely. Absolutely. Out of control. She can’t make her get a job, she literally can’t make her do anything. I’ve told my mom in the beginning of all this (2020) that she needs her keys taken and be held accountable and get some responsibility. My mom payed for her to go to cosmetology school this year, she stopped going at week three.

I’m 24, I operate heavy equipment and drive tractor trailers. My dad whooped my ass growing up and I payed the prices for my bad decisions and mistakes. Nothing abusive whatsoever, but certainly physically punished lol. My dad instilled in me to grow the f*** up and figure it out. 

That’s the approach I want to take with my little sister but I know she’s so emotionally sensitive and obviously I love her and I don’t want anything to happen to her. I can’t just say “grow the f*** up. I’m taking your keys until we get you a job or you choose to go to school”. The only way I know how to deal with this is 1. Not the right way as it’s too late for that and 2. I’m her brother and she won’t take me seriously even if I did.
 
My mom is talking to my aunt who’s got knowledge in mental health issues as she’s been in that career for years. My mother is talking about sending her to a physc ward tonight and I KNOW it’s going to take the police to get her there. 

One thing to add as well, my mom has made appointments to see a therapist and she’s gone like twice, (nobody can make her go)

I agree with that decision but I’m worried about what’ll happen after. Will she get out, come home, and commit? Nobody in my family has gone to one of these and I know she’ll feel ashamed and embarrassed. Not many people in our family will know about this either. But I’m also afraid she’ll just leave home and commit or never talk to us again.

I guess I’m seeking for help and if anybody knows what to do and has been in this situation before I would absolutely love to hear what you guys think. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/1bl8mdu/my_sister_needs_help/,t2_hg8dqyii2,2024-03-23 04:02:17,0,1
"Hello, is online therapy a thing in the PH?","I think I may have undiagnosed BPD. Matagal na to. I've lost so many people because I cant control my emotions. Yung highs and lows of BPD ramdam ko yon. I've been looking into it for around 4 years now pero student ako non at di ko afford magpatherapy.

Ang dami ko nang relasyon na nasira despite how much I care for the other person involved. Partners, friends, even my parents. I tend to be abusive verbally and physically and I really hate myself for it pero kapag galit ako lahat najjustify ko. 

I really wanna seek professional help kasi yung last partner ko sobrang pinagsisihan kong nagawa kong saktan. I want to be better for myself and my future partners. I've been planning to see a therapist mula nung magwork ako at afford ko na pero naiintimidate ako magpunta sa hospitals mag isa. I feel like I would be more comfortable if it's online, lalo sa current situation. 

If anyone has recommendations please let me know saka yung rates sana. I will really appreciate it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/h78a8h/hello_is_online_therapy_a_thing_in_the_ph/,t2_426zgmom,2020-06-12 06:37:12,8,11
i want out but i can’t,"i’m being gaslit here for my own beliefs (yung usual na kumokontra sa boomers’ mindset) dito sa bahay. di naman ako umiimik, sila yung una umaano sa akin. no physical abuse is going on. pero every waking day i feel nauseous. i relapsed again for the 3rd time during the whole quarantine period. ang hirap kapag sariling pamilya ang trigger. this household will kill me first than the virus. feeling ko nababaliw na ako. ang toxic dito sa bahay, hindi ko na kaya.

wala din kami sa manila. di rin sure if babalik kami manila after the 15th. i’d rather die to be honest, rather than slowly descend into madness here. before ecq i’ve already had issues with my mental health and i’m supposed to get psychiatric help this month as suggested by my counselor since talk therapy does not seem to be enough for me. i do not want to self diagnosed but i think i’m depressed (context: fucked up childhood, aksholi baka nga may ptsd din eh) and my counselor said that i seem to be exhibiting symptoms. i don’t know.

tsaka sa buong pamilya ako rin yung black sheep. di ko na talaga alam. tinatry ko naman sila intindihin, and i listen to their side pero bakit hindi nila yun magawa sa akin? ah oo hahahahahaha bata pa kasi ako, wala pa akong alam sa mundo, wala pa akong napapatunayan, ano ba alam ko? ano ba ambag ko? tsaka di totoo mental health haha dasal dasal lang bitawan ko na ang sakit na nararamdaman ko — as if kayang kaya ko gawin. pasensya na, maybe it’s the trauma. tsaka i hate the notion that just because i am young does not mean wala akong alam. 

i do not feel safe talking to my family about my mental health kasi sila rin yung enablers ng pagkalala ng mental state ko. i’m not blaming them pero if i explained my whole life story, you would understand. but in a nutshell, my childhood was fucked up and it is something that i never want to wish on anyone, even if it’s my worst enemy. that’s all i could say.

i feel suffocated and trapped here.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/gfxbfj/i_want_out_but_i_cant/,t2_igy1q,2020-05-09 01:21:35,12,3

Last,"Hi. I would just like to leave my receipt here. Because I know of all people, you guys will understand.

I'm 22 years old, on my last semester in college.

My boyfriend of 4 years broke up with me almost 3 weeks ago. My brother who is my favorite person in the world got home from Japan last month after 2 years but he had to go back to Japan to finish his PhD studies. My boyfriend left me the moment my brother had to go back to Japan. Now, I recently found out that my boyfriend was actually cheating on me for months now. It's sad because he knows all about my depression and trauma yet he chose to break me even further. I live with verbally, emotionally and physically abusive parents, and my sister who's also with us inherited my parents' toxic traits. I have a low self-esteem and I have never opened up to anyone but my boyfriend who I trusted so much, until he broke that trust. I was never allowed to speak up in my home. Whenever I express my feelings, they would usually use it against me or slap me across the face. There's also this one time when my mom continuously smashed my head on the floor because I asked her if we could talk nicely about the problem. I have great circles of friends but I never tell them any of my problems. I hate myself, and I am aware of how much I need to learn about self-love. But I always put others before myself. And I liked keeping it that way.

I've been stuck at home since the pandemic and my mental health has been worst. I was forced to study in a toxic environment. I only have my thesis defense coming up now, but I know I'll fail it because it's difficult for me to focus since I just went through a rough time. I study Chemistry, which was something I used to love, now it only exhausts me.

I've been suicidal since I was 13. I survived through writing, but now that I'm in college, I failed to put my thoughts in paper, so I'm bottling it all up. I have failed to seek professional help because I couldn't afford it, while free consultations were too much of a hassle for me.

I see no future ahead of me. What kept me going were my pets, my 12-year-old dog Miley, and thinking about how my friends would feel if they find out I'm gone.

But I've had enough. I want to think of myself now. I've been strong enough, it's just time for me to rest now. My boyfriend delivered the final blow. But this is not his fault. This is mine because it's my choice. Thank you for reading up to here. I hope you remember my story.

Goodbye.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/uq2dl3/last/,t2_ibylsxft,2022-05-15 17:23:12,7,7
Emotionally Immature Father Accuses the Family of Teaming Up Against Him,"At first, I thought of my father as a typical short-tempered dad. He doesn't open his mouth unless it is about his interests, or when upset about something. But as I grew older, I realized that he was simply emotionally immature.

The rest of the family would behave ourselves in the way he'd like. Mind you, all of my siblings are now college students. He doesn't like it when we leave the toilet seat closed. He doesn't like it when the bathroom floor is wet (despite having someone recently using the shower). He doesn't like it when his belongings are not within eyesight (absolutely do not hide them inside a simple cabinet). He doesn't like it when we eat using our fingers when eating fish or shrimp. He doesn't like it when the window screens are closed and he's feeling hot despite the mosquitoes that bite us at night. It also leaves the house very dusty, and we'd have to clean it a lot more.

He doesn't help us clean the house at all, and his assistance can only be needed when it's really really important. He doesn't clean his dishes nor is even bothered to leave them in the sink. But he gets upset when he needs to use the sink to brush his teeth and he sees that there are dirty dishes. He never admits his mistakes, and when we point it out, he gets really upset. But when *we* make a mistake, he makes a *huge* deal out of it.

We consistently walk on eggshells in the house just to prevent him from getting upset. He doesn't physically hurt us, but he is just utterly hard to live with. I'm not even allowed to watch things he doesn't approve of at home: LGBT shows, Filipino teleseryes, sexual or violent content, or even shows that don't make sense (he calls these shows where you don't think is for bobo), Kdramas or Japanese anime where he doesn't understand what they're speaking.

With all of these things in mind, the rest of the family is much closer to each other than to him. One time, we watched a comedy movie in the bedroom without him. My sibling was laughing so hard, and my mother told them to quiet it down because my father might hear us. You have no idea how much it hurts me. Are we not allowed to experience joy without him? and are we not allowed to simply laugh out loud despite how ""unacceptable"" he thinks the way that we laugh is?

This brings me to the reason why I wrote this post. He accuses us of teaming up against him. He gets upset because we try to console each other after his angry verbally abusive outbursts (he doesn't say profanities, but his words are still as sharp as a knife). He gets upset when we have fun activities without him. How could we not...? It's extremely hard to please him.

I just really want to let my feelings out here. Are there other people who experience family dynamics like this? If so, how do you cope?

Thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/195i00k/emotionally_immature_father_accuses_the_family_of/,t2_i33bh4me,2024-01-13 14:53:02,2,1
My anxiety got worse because we're going to work physically next week,"After an announcement that we'll be doing shifts to physically work in the office next week, my anxiety got triggered yet again. 

The government has already been failing to test most of the PH population. I think only around 0.1% of NCR is tested. South Korea has been doing mass testing for their citizens, but one person who went to a bar recently was able to cause another outbreak after the government chose to reopen.

I thought that with the knowledge of this, more companies would be more progressive and open to working from home given the hazards, but I guess my employer is not one of them. I honestly want to either resign or not go to work. I don't understand how people are so bent on going outdoors when there isn't a cure for the virus and the curve hasn't flattened at all. 

We are not essential workers and our products are not essential either. My marketing role can surely be fulfilled remotely. I don't know why our management fails to see the risk of going to work, especially for us whose physical presence isn't needed to fully function and accomplish tasks. Obviously, I can't report this to the government since this is their initiative.

Despite precautionary measures, I'm not confident that we'll get through this safely if the admin doesn't do mass testing. Not to mention, I'm scared of the police who seem to abuse their power amidst the burdensome crisis.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/gjewzi/my_anxiety_got_worse_because_were_going_to_work/,t2_2ctlbuz3,2020-05-14 12:03:01,15,4
Am i asking too much from my partner who is bipolar type 2?,"Names have been changed. Due to repeated outbursts, i’ve drafted an agreement with my partner. So he is reminded constantly of his actions. This agreement is only for the public outbursts he makes, which is the most difficult to manage. I have yet to make agreements on some other issues. Am i asking too much? 


See below:


This agreement should be followed with strict compliance since these are already norms of how to behave properly in public. The agreements below are no longer being discussed by people with a sound mind but due to repeated violations, it must be written for both parties to be constantly reminded of their actions.  

This agreement is created to ensure the following objectives:

1.       Full protection and safety for Nikki

2.       To aid Mark in his journey on managing his conditions.

Requirement before implementation of agreement:

Mark must first apologize and explain his actions to those he disturbed on the night of February 3. Nikki is coordinating with the HR representative to gather the names of the people who witnessed his outburst. At minimum, Mark can apologize to the security guard posted at that time of the said incident. An apology and explanation is a must should there be any similar incidents in the near future. This will enable the third-party who is unfamiliar with Mark’s situation to be able to understand and be educated about it.

Mark is not allowed to be seen in Nikki’s place of work starting from the time of his apology for two months. Mark can pick up Nikki 50 meters before or after his place of work such as McDonalds or Alpha Building. This is a strategy to let the issue die down and also prevent an outburst from happening near place of work of the aggrieved party in the near future.  

It must be noted that having a bi-polar condition or any other mental condition should never be an excuse to create a scene in full public view that includes but not limited to screaming, physical abuse, verbal abuse and threats. These behaviours should be controlled and managed by Mark’s medication issued by his psychiatrist. Nikki will not be responsible for Mark’s outburst if done in public. 

Agreement on settling differences:

1.       The two parties must settle their differences in private and no witnesses in sight.

2.       Nikki is given full authority to leave the scene should there be an argument that will take place or is currently taking place in public. No questions asked. This is a non-negotiable. The aggrieved party does not prefer creating scenes in public even if he is not a celebrity.

3.       Arguments such as, “nobody cares”, “they don’t know you” and the like are not acceptable.

4.       Threats such as, “i will kill you”, “I will kill your family” and the like are not acceptable and are grounds for grave threats, which can be reported to the police.

5.       Nikki is given maximum of two days to be left alone to reflect by himself should a similar incident happen again.

6.       Mark is only allowed maximum of three (3) times a year of “managed” public arguments. This means that whenever he will create a scene, Nikki is given full authority to leave instantly for the safety of himself and everyone in the venue. 

7.       Mark is not allowed to create a scene in places where Nikki resides such as his home, work, or amongst his family, friends, colleagues and acquaintances.

This contract is subject to termination or review should there be any violations to be committed by Mark. As reviewed by other parties, the agreement seems sound and reasonable.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/ez71ik/am_i_asking_too_much_from_my_partner_who_is/,t2_289eu607,2020-02-05 17:30:53,7,8
I need advice in rebuilding relationship,"We talked about this last chance but it's really solely on me, my other half gave me the ultimatum. Our relationship isn't perfect just like everybody else. The recent issue was due to miscommunication that led to where my partner and I are now. We had a fight, my partner made fun of me for getting a zero in a certain course and I took offense on that one knowing we had a past issue about micro-cheating and I felt like at that exact moment I was being cheated again because my other half chooses to acknowledge and praised someone else achievement over mine. I was really mad at that time, I vent out some of what I felt on my dummy account, and I was really pissed off about this one block mate of mine that keeps bragging shit to me, and I posted about that, but my other half thought that specific post was meant for them, but I was pertaining to my block mate who's gotten really into my nerves. I miscommunicated that, I was too late to explain everything because my partner already absorbed what I said. We were mad at each other, profanity and everything. I tried explaining things and I wanted to mend it. We both had our wrongdoings, but I had it worse. When I became persistent in making it right with this last shot. I said just give me this last chance and I will leave you be without question or explanation; I will respect that if I mess things up again. My other half perceived my move as me being controlling, manipulative, creepy, and obsessive. That's why I think I messed up big time around this time. In addition to that, there were unexpected events that made our situation worse than it is now. Now, my partner's family knows our relationship and my other half received physical violence and verbal abuse from them because of us being together. My other half is not accepted for who they are. We had an agreement about this last chance and If I mess things up again which leads to making my other half feel that unpleasant feelings again, doesn't matter if it's only one mistake then it's over. Right now, we're trying to rebuild everything, we will start with civil interaction and slowly progress back to being casual and back to romantic interactions, but we still have that label until my other half is comfortable again around me. This will take time because I don't think my partner trusts me enough that I can make things right and better this time around. I'm having a hard time on what things I should consider; everything feels uncertain even though my other half gave me assurance that they will try to compromise not fully for now but little by little and slowly until we get back. I have to make double efforts in this one. Is it really possible to rebuild a relationship from scratch? **What things can a person do to be able to regain someone's feeling of security and comfort around them as well as how to work this out without losing yourself in the long run?**  


\*\*TL;DR;\*\* : We're trying to rebuild everything from scratch, going back to civil interaction. Everything feels uncertain and it feels like this is all just stalling to an inevitable end, or maybe I'm just overthinking things but I don't want to back down without a fight. What's making me anxious is the fact that it's an all-or-nothing risk. Rebuilding from scratch is a tough battle. I don't know what to do to be able to bring back the pieces together again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/173pnjs/i_need_advice_in_rebuilding_relationship/,t2_leclguq7e,2023-10-09 19:41:01,3,2
Help please po,"Ok. If you're gonna check my past post. I've been everywhere dito sa reddit, trying to make sense of it all. Trying to call out for help , sharing my story and my rants pero it all fell on deaf ears. Di ko alam. Di ko alam bakit. Depressed ako matagal na actually but I was like a functioning depressed person, I'm able to go to work, do my job, established ""friendships"" and Connections with other people. I even had hobbies like drinking and playing video games, I love food. I'm diabetic but I love the feeling of being full and content. I'm married, been married for 20 years now she a good responsible wife pero I cheated her a couple of times, it's not about love it's just about the excitement it brings. Even my playmates are cheaters too. Wither they're married or in a stable relationship or may mga suitors but they're not that aggressive daw. Everyone wants to be fucked hard, sabi nga noong Isa, but don't want the complications attached to it. My relationship with my family , dad and mom.. to be honest was purely kaplastikan, specially sa Mon ko. Why you ask? Because I was abused by these fuckers as I was growing up emotionally, mentally, verbally and corporal punishment and humiliation is their only solution. They feed you , they give you a roof over your head but if you don't perform in a certain way, you're a 1orthless piece of shit. The insults comes, the comparison between you and other people becomes intense, then it depends who pero the physical pain is next, the slapping, the punching, the kicking, the spitting in your face. I use to think of it as normal. Na it's my fault. So I hid the scars, hid the pain. When my dad was about to die.. he smacked me over the face with a crystal ashtrays. Over sa 2 pisong sukli.. He apologize later and Akala ko dahil Mahal nya ako, pero Hindi pala. Dahil Kasi mahina na na sya, na malapit na sya mamatay, at kailangan nya ng alaga. When he died, turned into a slut bitch, ala pa Isang taon nakahanap na Ng kapalit ng ama ko na alang silbi, pinabayaan Ang negosyo iniwan ng ama ko, kaya naghihirap kami, Yung puro yabang at pag dodminnante nya sa akin pilit nya binabalik pero malaki na ako gaga. Di na uubra Ang mga pautot mo noon . Matigas na buto ko at ala ka na maooffer sa akin na worth it  nagtratrabaho ako noon, kumita ng Pera. Iba talaga pag may Pera ka, kahit anong basura mo noon, nagiiba dahil sa Pera. Di Naman ako naging suwail na anak pinilit ko ibalik Ang dating pagsasama namin ni mama, may share ako lagi sa expenses, pag linngo magpapaluto Ako ng ulam. Pero Ina talaga sapak ng ugali nya. Parang bi polar na ewan.
Basta pag ala syang pera. Lahat ng mabuting ugali nya nawawala at napapalitan nitong sakim na masungit na mayabang na Akala mo Alam lahat pero bobo Naman. Napaka judgemental pa sobra. Ingittera, na judgemental.
Ang tanging kakaiba is Yung kapatid ko. Minahal ko ng lubos yon ako panganay at alam ko Ang hirap na dadanasin nya sa kamay ng magulang ko. Ako Yung nagsilbing buffer.. between them.
Lumipas Ang panahon nagsarili na rin ako, lumayo nagasawa. Inamin ko may mga panahon di Ako nakakapunta sa nanay ko. Na ngayon pinagaral Ang kapatid ko.

Pag may Pera o special na occasion nag binigay ako. Never Ako nakahingi sa kanila bago Ako nagkasakit.

And then 2022. Nagkasakit ako ng grabe. Stage 5 kidney disease. Dialysis for life. Tad tad ako sa gamot, kapos lagi sa Pera, ibat ibang side effects Ang nararamdaman ko. Lagnat, pneumonia, Hilo, panlalabo ng mata, pabghihina, pagod na di mawala Wala. At on top of that kapos ako sa pera, may trabaho ako WFH. Pero as of October force leave kami. Namamalimos na nga Ako halos ehhh. Sa mga kaibigan mga dating kaklase, katrabaho, may mga. Nagbigay madami ala.

Pinamasakit. My brother disowned me. Na brain wash ng nanay ko, ayaw daw Ako Makita. Ayaw ako dalawin. Napakasakit.

Now. I'm depressed. I barely get out of my bed, I locked myself sa kwarto ko. I isolated my self. I have no Hope and really I just want to die, bukod sa mga physically fragility ko. My mind is Soo frail at the moment the world means shit.. my wife keeps tugging me to live pero ewan ko.

I'm [22] moving out with my parents in a few months. i have a dilemma,"Hi! Might be be a long post, need to release. Read at your own risk po
TW : PEOPLE PLEASING , ABUSE , NARCISSISTIC FAMILY 

Update: opened this up on my mom, told me na pinamihasa ko kasi :) as if may choice ako sa bahay na 'to lmao

I've been alright these past few years compared sa last posts ko. I have learned to detach na rin and cut off my toxic best friend and other people this year. Tho sometimes I feel it's too much but I really don't know what to do since I grew up na I'm always invalidated na from anxiously attached ako, I became avoidant or fearfully avoidant attached na. 

I have plans na kapag lumipat na ako sa nirenovate na bahay ng parents ko, may privacy na ako to work from home, continue my small business, have therapy, mag-ipon to move out ulit and just do stuff na I had to halt for 3 years. When my sister got pregnant and her partner was abroad I had to share my room with her and sobrang adjustment ang ginawa namin because iba ang upbringing namin. Now, I'm in my parent's room and she's with her partner in the other room, her partner is working sa pwesto ng parents ko. 

Me:
+finished college
-pressured as fuck, almost gave up on my life if my sis didn't talk to me
-golden child, more like trophy child
-isabella of encanto, lexi of euphoria😜🥴
-sheltered by helicopter and narcissistic parents
-opinion never mattered, stayed silent all the time, parents just minimize me

her [27]
-highschool grad but doesn't bother to educate herself na since she was physically abused by my dad when she was a teen 
-moved out when she was a teen for like 6 years
-streetsmart
-has 2 kids, sometimes pinapaiwan sa'kin 'yung baby para mag-asikaso ng importante at hindi importanteng bagay
-scapegoat, always arguing with my parents, never naging tama sa mga parents ko even if she's right sometimes
-very dismissing about mental health
+cooks for the household but minsan na lang (i can feed myself naman)

The dilemma:
I have four people that are not really great for my wellbeing and I've cut off na 'yung isa, these three will be much harder.

I can't express boundaries at her. Kasi like our parents and my ex-best friend, she'd definitely go batshit angry, sumbat, guilttrip, and manipulate me. I just once told her when we had a family business na kapag may nag-PM na gustong magpadeliver, she needs to ask agad the contact details of the buyer but nagalit siya kaya nga raw dinederetso na sa akin na mag-PM because alam niyang inquiry about delivery 'yun, making me switch accounts and wasting time when she could have asked it na.

Once called her out because she called my cat a disability slur and nagalit talaga siya kaya 'di ko na inulit kahit palagi niyang ginagamit 'yun as an adjective for being weird. 

She's the type na magpaparinig nang magpaparinig, magpavictim, publicized ang subtle issues. Slightly takot rin ako kasi kapag may nakaaway siya ang lakas ng karma pabalik sa kaaway niya. Since she can visit me anytime she could get so angry at me.

Need i-spoonfeed. Puro pasuyo sa Gcash, tanong, pinapasa sa'kin gustong orderin sa shopee when she could order it herself naman, ayaw magpacheck up at tinatanong ang symptoms sa'kin. Kapag naman sinasabi ko ayaw makinig, like 'wag dapat kutkutin 'yung pigsa sa ilong lalong ginagawa, hangga't hindi nakakarinig ng advice sa ibang tao hindi titigil. Palagi kong tinuturuan pero ayaw iabsorb.

I had to people please and mediate their dynamics with my parents. Ako naiipit, my parents talk shit about her, my sister open up and trauma dump at me. Need kong umintindi nang sobra kasi walang kakampi. So because she's thankful na we had the same sentiments, she's expecting na I'll be there for her 24/7, pero pagod na pagod na ako. My relatives say maswerte siya sa'kin sobra to do every favors she wanted.

What is the importance of mental health awareness?,"Mental health awareness has gained significant recognition in recent years, shedding light on an issue that was once shrouded in stigma and silence. It is a topic that has become increasingly important in our fast-paced, modern world, where stress, anxiety, and depression are prevalent. This article explores the significance of mental health awareness, its impact on individuals and society, and the steps we can take to promote a healthier and more compassionate approach to mental well-being.

**Reducing Stigma**

One of the most crucial aspects of mental health awareness is its ability to combat the stigma surrounding mental illnesses. For decades, mental health issues were often seen as a sign of weakness or something to be hidden. This stigma prevented many individuals from seeking help when they needed it, leading to untreated mental health conditions and their potential to worsen.

By promoting awareness, we can challenge these harmful stereotypes and misconceptions. It helps people understand that mental health problems are not a personal failing but a common and treatable aspect of the human experience. This change in perception encourages those who are suffering to reach out for support without fear of judgment or discrimination.

**Early Intervention and Treatment**

Mental health awareness plays a vital role in early intervention and treatment. When individuals and their loved ones are more informed about the signs and symptoms of mental health conditions, they are better equipped to recognize when someone may be struggling. Early identification allows for prompt intervention, reducing the severity and duration of the illness.

Moreover, increased awareness empowers individuals to seek help for themselves. It encourages a proactive approach to mental well-being, where people are more likely to access professional treatment and support when they recognize the need. Early intervention not only improves individual outcomes but also reduces the overall burden on the healthcare system.

**Improved Overall Health**

Mental health is closely interconnected with physical health. Mental health conditions can have a profound impact on an individual's physical well-being, leading to increased risk factors for chronic diseases, substance abuse, and a compromised immune system. Furthermore, stress and anxiety can manifest physically, contributing to issues such as high blood pressure and heart disease.

By promoting mental health awareness, we emphasize the importance of holistic well-being. Encouraging regular check-ins with mental health professionals and fostering self-care practices can lead to better overall health outcomes. When people prioritize their mental health, they are more likely to engage in healthy behaviors, maintain social connections, and manage stress effectively.

**Productivity and Workplace Well-being**

Mental health awareness is not confined to the personal sphere; it has significant implications for the workplace as well. The modern work environment often places immense pressure on employees, leading to stress, burnout, and decreased productivity. When employers prioritize mental health awareness and create supportive workplace cultures, the benefits are far-reaching.

Promoting mental well-being in the workplace not only enhances employee morale but also boosts productivity and creativity. It reduces absenteeism and turnover rates, leading to cost savings for organizations. Moreover, employees are more likely to feel valued and supported, leading to higher job satisfaction and a better work-life balance.

**Stronger Communities**

A society that fosters mental health awareness is one that values the well-being of its members. When individuals are educated about mental health and its challenges, they are more likely to reach out to friends, family, and community resources when someone is struggling. This creates a network of support that can make a significant difference in someone's recovery journey.

Strong communities also reduce feelings of isolation and loneliness, which are common experiences for individuals with mental health conditions. By promoting open and empathetic conversations about mental health, we create spaces where people can connect and share their experiences, ultimately building a sense of belonging and solidarity.

**Suicide Prevention**

Mental health awareness is a key component of suicide prevention. Many individuals who contemplate suicide are dealing with untreated or undiagnosed mental health conditions. Raising awareness about the signs of suicidal ideation and providing resources for intervention can save lives.

When society is more attuned to mental health issues, it becomes easier to identify when someone may be in crisis. Friends, family members, and colleagues can step in to offer support or connect the individual to professional help. Additionally, public awareness campaigns can reduce the stigma associated with suicide, making it more acceptable for individuals to seek help when they are struggling with suicidal thoughts.

**Resilience and Coping Skills**

Mental health awareness equips individuals with the knowledge and skills needed to build resilience and cope with life's challenges. Understanding that it is okay to seek help and engage in self-care practices promotes emotional well-being.

Education about mental health also provides people with tools to manage stress, anxiety, and difficult emotions effectively. When individuals have access to coping strategies and resources, they are better equipped to navigate life's ups and downs without succumbing to the negative effects of untreated mental health conditions.

**Policy and Advocacy**

Mental health awareness plays a crucial role in shaping public policy and advocacy efforts. When a society is informed about the prevalence and impact of mental health issues, there is greater pressure on governments and institutions to allocate resources for mental health services. Advocacy groups and individuals can push for policy changes that prioritize mental health and expand access to care.

The importance of mental health awareness cannot be overstated. It is a fundamental aspect of creating a compassionate, supportive, and healthy society. By reducing stigma, promoting early intervention and treatment, improving overall health outcomes, enhancing workplace well-being, fostering stronger communities, preventing suicide, building resilience, and driving policy changes, mental health awareness brings about a positive ripple effect that benefits us all. As we continue to prioritize mental health in our lives and communities, we move closer to a world where everyone has the opportunity to thrive emotionally and mentally.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/16c3psg/what_is_the_importance_of_mental_health_awareness/,t2_g13g4k1ez,2023-09-07 10:22:45,1,3
Thinking about Moving Out of My Parent's House,"Hi, good day! I'll post the exact trigger warnings before I discuss my story so here:

TW: sexual abuse, child molestation, and depression

Last June of 2022, I had my first therapy appointment because in reality I had not been feeling well mentally. It only took one session for my doctor to diagnose me with MDD. The story is I was molested when I was a child, I remember trying to sleep and there was this man who shoved his fingers down my pants. I was frozen and didn't know what I could do. I thought I dreamt that up but this man continued to do it for several years. 

I have known that man since I was a child since he is a very close friend of my father. Whenever he would stay at our home, he'd find ways to touch me, passing it off as a ""massage"", starting from my foot and rising up my body to grope my private area and my chest. He'd do it especially when my parents aren't around. At the time, I really didn't understand what was happening, I was only so young. He'd ask me if it was ok to ""massage"" and I don't usually respond because I was frozen, during the whole time he'd do it, I just dissociate and imagine something in my brain until it passes.

He continued doing that but it got worse in 2020-2021. Since we didn't have a helper at our home, he was tasked to take care of us so it would just be him, my brother, and I. I'd spend most of my time in my room but when I have to eat or watch TV, he'd start doing those ""massages"" again. By that time I was already 15-17 and at this point, I had really thought I'd get used to it. If you asked me why I didn't report this to my parents: (1) I felt immense shame and guilt, I felt so dirty to have been touched by someone who is supposed to be an adult (2) I felt that if I told them, my father would hate me for it. He's much closer to this friend of his than he is with us and I have always tried to seek my father's approval, reporting him (the guy) as the perpetrator would only damage our relationship. Or, I have a fear that no one would believe me if I said something and that people would say that I'm only ""faking"" what happened. Additionally, he'd always do it when my brother is not in the room.

Either way, it led to me having depressive episodes, I didn't know it yet but I would not shower for days, I would starve myself just so that I don't have to be around him, and I didn't care about my grades anymore because I'd rather be in bed. It was such a difficult time for me and my whole social life, emotional health, shs grades, and mental health suffered badly.

Sooner or later, we were able to find a helper and because of that, he was no longer needed in our house; instead, he'd go with my father wherever he goes. I just wanted to say that I felt like I was emotionally manipulated into thinking he was a good guy, since he'd usually take my side in things but now I realize that despite those memories that doesn't erase the fact that he's a disgusting pedophile and a  sexual abuser who took advantage of a minor.

After those events, I had become better, I started being able to take care of myself again and I became so happy knowing I didn't have to experience that again. But the thing is, I kept that whole thing by myself. And maybe that's why the whole time I was just so angry and upset. My ex boyfriend and I were in a relationship during that time and I'd say that he took the brunt of my anger. Anything - whether big or small - could make me tick. I was essentially toxic and would emotionally and verbally abuse my brother and my ex. I just couldn't handle my anger.

To cut it short, I decided to cut off my relationship with him and decided to socially withdraw from all my friends last year. I spent my time just watching shows and movies. I felt that in my anger and experience, I wasn't dealing with it healthily.

That's why I convinced my mom to get me to therapy and I broke down on my first appointment to my doctor about all of these experiences. She considered me for PTSD, BPD, or MDD but she settled with the lattermost condition. It felt so good to finally be able to tell someone about it, I felt as if the weight of being SA'd was lifted, even by a bit. Also yes, I recognized I was toxic and started repairing my relationships with my family and friends , and because of her, I managed to deal with my emotions and MDD. I was also prescribed anti depressants for it.

Now in April 2023, after almost a year of that event, I feel really numb to be honest. I still have recurring depressive episodes and my doc had to up my dose to 30mg Fluoxetine. Even then, I'd still see the guy at least 2x a month and lately, I've been having flashbacks to the SA that happened. For example, I go out of my room and see the couch where the ""massages"" happened, Id have intrusive and wanted memories of it. And essentially, I no longer feel safe in my own house. My doctor mentioned this as my mental health would still be impacted when he's around. It's not as worse as it was but I still have low energy and motivation for anything in my life.

So what I'm trying to say is I want to convince my doc to convince my parents if it's possible to change my environment - that being, the physical. Because maybe if I move out of town, I don't have to see him as much and I don't have to be under the suffocating hands of my semi-toxic parents. My mom is improving naman with dealing with this (context: she's a christian who thinks that this happened because I don't pray to god anymore) but my father on the other hand invalidated my experience by saying that, ""it is something that I should forget because it's in the past."" Still, my parents act like it's a nuisance to them and told me not to divulge this at all to anyone for the fear of judgment and stigma. 

Either way, I'm really hoping that by studying out of town or just being out of my hometown will help me improve my mental health. Any thoughts/advice on this?

TL;DR I was abused as a child until I was almost an adult (5-17) by my father's best friend, mainly in my own home. Hoping to convince my psychiatrist if it's better for me to study outside of my hometown so my environmental stressors lessen. Would love your thoughts on this, thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/12zbgo4/thinking_about_moving_out_of_my_parents_house/,t2_d7bygbnc,2023-04-26 16:55:59,1,5
"Im tired of fighting, I just want a break from this horrible life.","I am 18, soon becoming a freshman in college, I am lost, I am fucked up mentally and physically, my family is fucked up, my environment is fucked up, everything is fucked up.

Growing up, I am a pretty jolly and friendly, but most people discriminated me, I do good at school and everything, is just that I am colored, the small town that I used to live most people there hate people that are colored and prejudiced, so they called me ""negro"" instead of my real name, at least most of them and sometimes even the n word, even my teachers discriminated me, even my own older siblings, some people didn't, but most people did treated me badly, and some bullied me at school, they didn't really got into my head until I am in grade 6 where I began to become more self conscious and puberty is slowly kicking in, it really got into my head, I've realized that people don't like me and started developing bad social anxiety and OCD that my parents thought where mannerisms. I am not even black, I am brown colored and there's nothing wrong being black but that's what people treated me.

Before middle school, we moved out of that town, and moved to another province, I am not discriminated there, and felt accepted finally, but my own family is fucked up, my mom has been into 2 relationships, I have 4 half siblings, which they don't really like me that much, and 1 younger real blood sibling. And at that time we are living in my grandma's house, and I thought things gonna be better, but I am wrong. My mom is often gone and sometimes for months because of her real estate careet, and they treated us really bad, and my half sister's son used to bully me everyday, spit on me, mess with my stuff, and even physically, I can't do anything and they don't give a shit. And I've experienced rampant emotional and sometimes physical abuse from them and my other siblings don't care. When my mom got home, I've said everything but she didn't do anything. The only time something happened is when I step up and retaliated, and I almost got a beat up for it but it is all worth it, we moved outta there.

Now I am left depressed, socially anxious, and have really bad OCD, been to 2 doctors and they didn't help, one just made my condition much worse and misdiagnosed me with Bipolar, luckily I've stopped taking her meds early. I am planning to get therapy but covid happened and we struggled financially, and  I need to wait a month more to get one.

I am pretty much a people pleaser and never been myself for a long time, and I am friends with people that I don't really like being with but no choice because I am afraid of being alone. I am just tired my OCD is getting unbearable everyday and school is just stressful, and now I am getting pressured to choose on what path should I get, but honestly I don't know, I love music, I love writing songs, I love art, but my parents would for sure make me get something like engeneering or law, I do good at school but I don't enjoy it, maybe because of my mental condition, honestly I am starting to get numb and don't feel pleasure, only pain and sadness, and I've  been like this for almost 5-6 years now, honestly I am beginning to become hopeless. I did everything I can to help myself from exercising, improving myself, reading self help books and consuming self improvement content, meditating 2x a day, facing my fears, nothing helped, I am still fucked in the head. My mom I think is on another affair, same thing with my dad who is working overseas as an OFW, they are not married but it adds up to my fucked up life. He is still supporting us but he sees me as an investment. I don't know why I am suffering like this and why do I deserve this, I am just tired. I feel like everyone will just gonna treat me shit and judge me, and I know that's not true, but that's what my brain believes and how it was wired.

I am sorry for the long post and unecessary sob story, wala lang akong mapagsabihan and pagod na talaga ako.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/mvk10e/im_tired_of_fighting_i_just_want_a_break_from/,t2_s7xco9b,2021-04-22 00:55:53,5,1
"Should I switch to another psychiatrist? If yes, do you have recos?","I've been seeing this St. Luke's-based psychiatrist since August 2018. She diagnosed me with Persistent Depressive Disorder and ADHD (I dunno which type but maybe combined?). Now I've told her nearly everything about me, like the fact that I was bullied by my peers and physically and emotionally abused by my parents as a child. Last Friday, my mom hit me repeatedly in the head for ""talking back to her"". My dad told me I deserved to be beaten up kasi I ""was egging on my mom"". I asked my psychiatrist for help through text but received none (it's been 5 days since I texted her, but still no reply haist). Our sessions are basically listening to me talk about what happened to me since our last session and then after my 1hr is up she gives me my prescriptions (I take 5mg vortioxetine and 50mg quetiapine/night for my depression and 36mg Concerta/day for my ADHD). My entire family is forcing me to make peace with my parents even though I'm not yet emotionally ready for a reconnection. With no help forthcoming from anyone, I feel trapped and there are times wherein I think nothing makes sense. These past few days I've been more irritable/moody than usual, and I'm also somewhat more passively suicidal than I normally am (existential angst + childhood trauma lol). I haven't told my psychiatrist about this new development though because I feel like she doesn't really care, what with her radio silence on my latest text and her demeanour during our sessions. Also, my psychiatrist charges 4k/session, which is really too much IMO. All these are seriously making me want to switch psychiatrists, but do you guys think doing so would be wise/advisable? If yes, do you guys have recos (pls include the price huhu)?",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/lizuga/should_i_switch_to_another_psychiatrist_if_yes_do/,t2_3scvvcay,2021-02-13 20:40:04,5,8
I request advice for overcoming my specific stress and depression issue,"I am more often than not feeling like on a emotional rollercoaster. But not alternating from highs and lows. It feels like being nervous. The nervousness is gigantic. My stress levels are usually extremely high. Higher than what most normal people would experience in a lifetime, so it's hard for me to be understood. It's mentally blinding.

I've been stuck in a cycle of sleep-deprivation for 3+ years. I can't sleep at night deliberately since I'm too stressed to do that. Usually I get knocked out involuntarily very late and sleep a little.

This doesn't sound very hard. But for you to understand why it's hard, I've been physically and mentally ill in other ways (including in excruciatingly painful and disabling ways that make me much different from a normal person), living in a abusive environment daily, and in a crisis to not stay stuck this way indefinitely so I can exit my abuse and not become too old to do what I want in my future. The latter is a legit concern since there's limited time to begin it.

I've been silently screaming within for years. This HASN'T been deliberate. I really don't will this and want it to stop. It feels just like screaming but inaudible.
 
I'm a courageous person and was before the initial injury of bad luck which started the catastrophic combination of my ""arduous life situation"". I could consistently stifle my fears and act with discipline to take strategically-calculated bets. I put so much effort into describing why it's difficult so you don't misunderstand it as an issue of cowardice. What I feel is beyond fear, it's a agonizing muddle of insanity, while exhausted by sleep-deprivation and afflicted by all the other stuff. 

The thing that upsets me the most is my injustices. At some point I feel like just raging and not being patient. I could try to have discipline but feel an extreme aversion to it. Another reason why I want to get cured so badly is to return to take revenge. I would be able to do it since I'd have the exalted health. 

I also have disgusting insanities, my name for a type of insanity that I just have to look away from. An example of one is suddenly imagining my face covered by cockaroaches. There's ones unsuitable to mention publicly. It's like a nightmare grips me with compulsion and I have to break free with my mind. Not as a healthy sharp person, but somone ill and exhausted and already constantly screaming.

Doing trivial tasks such as hygiene and exercise and healthy eatting are very strainful for me. And even dangerous due to my injuries. So, I've lacked such things. Recently though, I've been better at them.

I need to fix my health issues one by one. And the top priority one is the sleep. So, I request advice on how to be able to consistently sleep early and deliberately. Not typical advice like ""wake up at the same time every day"" or ""spend some time without a screen to wind down before bed"". Advice like that isn't heavy-duty enough. I need a plan to extremely lower my stress. This isn't like any normal stressful event at school or work or sleeping issue. This is a health crisis where light methods of destressing aren't enough.

My peril is that I could stay stuck repeatedly suffering new injustices and injuries, miss out on what I want to do most in my life in the future, and never get vengeance. I must maximally stress to save myself from that.

I resent my parents/family,"I have Bipolar Disorder. There are times when memories are triggered and I simply can't help but to loathe my parents for:

1. Having this f@#$ng condition. I know this disease is genetically predisposed. Though they won't admit it, growing up I observed them having psychotic tendencies (ie irrational anger, anxiety attacks, pathological lying, violence towards us children).
I wish I never had them as parents!  I also think that there should be a strict policy that people should be assessed for psychological problems before procreating. Not all should be parents! And no one deserves to be in a family where mental illness could be passed off to offsprings. 

2. The physical, verbal and emotional abuse I suffered from them. They were whipping and beating the hell out of us when we were kids under the guise of 'godly discipline' and training up a child the way he should go. 
I hated them so much for this. I had bruises and bumps all over my body back then just bec of the petty things I did when I was young. I was whipped indiscriminately all over my body. I tried being whipped with a hanger, slipper, belt including the knuckle, bamboo stick, broom, dust pan, everything that my parents touch will be used to hurt me for the sake of discipline. I have been punched and kicked in private and public to embarrassed me in front of other people who didn't even help me. 
The physical bruises healed, but the emotional pain persists. 
When I was young I wanted so much to call Bantay Bata to be rescued. None of our relatives came to our aid. They allowed us to be treated that way and to live in such a dysfunctional family. The whipping and beating only stopped when I was first year high school, but the verbal abuse continued until in college. 

3. Being religious nuts/hypocrites. Their so called Christianity was forced upon me. I would be whipped if I don't go to church with them on Sundays. They would also not give me food back then. They manipulated me to do the salvation thing by accepting Jesus as my personal Lord and savior which I didn't understand yet when I was 10yo. They forced me to be baptized at 12yo. All they did is to make me attend their Church and do all those religious things. My father is a deacon, he participated in church activities and teach Sunday school. It's always in my mind how hypocritical they are. Saintly during Sundays from 9am to 5pm only, but a tyrant at home. 
One time I was having a feat Bec of my mood swings as bipolar, they restrained me and did an exorcism procedure!!! I was f@#$ng angry at them. They are so closed minded and didn't understand what I have. I have been called demonyita / diablo / anak ng demonyo. 
My mother said the condition that is happening to me is a challenge to the family and a work of the devil Bec my father is now teaching in Sunday School.  Arrrggghhhh!!!! I hate them

3. They always verbalize and made me feel that I am less of a person, not good enough, compared to other kids who are smarter, prettier etc. 
Growing up my mother will always tell me she had to give up her career to raise us and be a full time house wife. She blamed me particularly Bec I am the first born. I felt she blamed me bec she is miserable with her life. 
She is kinder and more loving to my brothers and cousins. She always made me feel that I am her least favorite person.

4. They were the reason my ex and I broke up. They were so strict to me,never allowed me to have a boyfriend. 
Pinagdamutan akong magmahal at magpakasal noong okay pa ako before ako madiagnosed. 
So I'm here stuck with them. I have Bipolar, unable to keep a job, still living with them though I wanted so much to leave.

Sana gumaling na ako, makatayo sa sarili Kong papa at maging independent sa kanila. 
Or mamatay na. Nauubos na Ang pag asa ko makalaya. 
I am embarrassed na nakatira pa rin ako sa kanila at Hindi ako masaya na kasama sila dahil sa trauma na binigay nila. 

Ako mismo Ang nagpadoktor sa sarili ko na may konting pag asang gumaling. 

My parents are more likely to do another exorcism on me than to seek professional medical help.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/ecaka4/i_resent_my_parentsfamily/,t2_57t4qfhu,2019-12-18 17:49:27,6,4
A preliminary diagnosis from the internet.,"Hello all,

I am coming to the mystical world of Reddit to see if anyone can help me with figuring out whatever the hell is wrong with me.

Before anyone gets the wrong idea. Yes, I have been seeing a doctor but I live in the UK so getting an appointment of any kind is a crap shoot. I am currently on a waiting list for a psychologist.

I figure there's a few people that could help me out, offer advice and perhaps inspire healthy conversation.

A little about me I am in my late 20's. Incredibly introverted and only really go out when my partner goes with me. Not all the time I do go for walks by myself but when I do its usually to places I know no one else will be. I have one close friend besides my partner and no family that I keep in touch with. I had a difficult home life as a child filled with both physical and psychological abuse

Ok without further ado here are some weird things that I deal with.

&#x200B;

1. I especially notice this today after being out all day but I have had the same thing for as long as I can remember in various different situations. I had a long interaction with a few people in a new place and it was all benign conversation but very polite. They were very welcoming and nothing bad happened, literally smiles all around. But as soon as I left I felt like an idiot. I feared I had told them too much about myself, that I shouldn't do that ever. Never be so forward and now everyone knows who I am and I will never be able to live in peace. etc etc. It always happens when I allow myself to relax and just be honest and open in a conversation. It leaves me worried and my brain refuses to shut off. Instead replaying every second and filling me with dredd
2. I am incredibly introverted. I love my space. My home, my environment and I hate leaving it. My partner often gets frustrated with me because I stay inside a lot. Even little things like going to the supermarket 10 mins away seem like an overwhelming task. Strange smells, people and noises make me so anxious. It's a shame because most people in this area are really nice and helpful and I feel like I am abrupt and rude to them just so I can end the interaction and leave. I love the idea of not existing to people. Being out of sight and out of mind living in my tiny happy bubble.
3. I get overwhelmed easily and a lot. I work from home so I'm essentially my own boss and manage my time the best I can. But more and more it seems like the simplest task is a mountain I cannot climb. I have allot of personal and commission projects I'm desperately behind on because what at first tackle seemed like a straightforward operation is now a minefield of mistakes and futile hope. It makes me anxious and very tired leading me to nap a lot to recover mounds of energy lost on panic and procrastination.
4. Over attachment. I am incredibly attached to my partner. I function well and am incredibly happy when he is around. But when he is not at home I find my energy levels low and I am unmotivated to do anything. I just sit on the sofa staring at the door like a puppy waiting for his master to return. I am perhaps exaggerating a little. But I fear my dependence on him for all these things will lead to something terrible happening in our relationship.

Those are the main things I can think of atm but if I can identify and articulate more I will edit the post. For now, tho I think I covered all the worst spots.

Sorry to go on so long but if you made it this far then thank you

As I said. Any help/support/ kindred spirits would be welcome.

&#x200B;

Have a great day.

What is wrong with me?,"Hi, lately I didn’t feel so good. I mean there are phases in my life where I lay in bed for days without any motivation to do something. Yesterday I also had the feeling of throwing up and headaches after days of feeling overwhelmed and stressed. I keep reminding myself about things that happened in my life and feel irritated around or have splitted thoughts about people. I never know who to trust and if they want to do me wrong or good. I have childhood trauma and a bad relationship with my parents. They are very physically and verbally abusing to the point that I got panic attacks. I’ve also been forced into a psychiatry 2 times in my lifetime, because of anger issues and suicidal thougts. I feel like I could have some undiagnosed mental illnesses, because I don’t think that I’m normal. My reactions aren’t normal, they are impulsive and I’m too sensitive. Sometimes I feel like dying, because my emotions are so intense. I just want to shut everything completely off. I feel like I’m just existing and not really living my life, as if I lost so much of my time doing absolutely nothing. People who aren’t emotionally available or tend to hurt me are attracted by me and I can’t stop it. I tend to go towards people who make me feel like I’m unworthy of being loved. It is like a never ending circle. I’m attracted to men who don’t want to commit and it got me to that point where I feel sick and tired of it. I hate giving my all to people and never get it back. I wish some people would see how intense I am. I’m traumatized by people and needy and obsessive until it gets destructive. My grades are average, but I know I could do better. I hate when people compare myself with others. I could be so much better in school if my concentration problems just disappeared and if I had a safe place to study. When I was younger, I always enjoyed drawing, now it just feels like a burden to me, something that is so exhausting to do. Nothing interests me anymore, even though I want to explore and learn new things. Can’t read a book properly without traumatic scenes getting into my head again. Everytime I think it gets better, it goes downhill again. Why do I need to suffer sm? Why do I only have bad luck in life? Am I depressed? It feels weird for me to post this on here but I can’t help myself anymore. I’ve been bottling myself up for too long and just need to set my thoughts free for once.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/wakiov/what_is_wrong_with_me/,t2_p0y335lo,2022-07-29 04:33:52,5,6
I'm almost flipping out,"I am 30M. I will tell you about my story briefly. I grew up in an environment full of women. My parents were together, but you know on paper only. I have a father who loves me so much, and he has been physically there with me, but he left my mother with all the responsibilities and emotional needs that should have been a guide for a son and he lived his own life.

I have always been bullied by boys around me just because I had not been swearing, not speaking inappropriately about girls, or objectifying them. They considered me gay, incomplete, or ""less than a man"". I suffered a long period of abuse in childhood. When I started middle school, I was in a relationship with the most beautiful girl in the school and we stayed in a relationship for 2.5 years, but even then I kept hearing all those insults. At some point, I started to question if they might be right, why I couldn't convince them, and why I couldn't be a ""real man"", just like one of them.

My perspective shifted and I went into a great darkness, I had no idea who I was anymore and I lived almost my whole life in this darkness. I had girlfriends, and I had long-lasting relationships, but I was never able to surrender to a woman, I never let myself go, I never allowed myself to let anyone love me, and I never allowed myself to really love anyone.

On the other hand, I lived my whole life observing the other men around me. On streets, on a bus, in the sauna or gym, etc. Those men became an object for me and I started to compare myself with them by seeing their more masculine side than mine such as being hairier, having sharper features, being more muscular, having a bigger penis, appearing more fearless, having more possessive attitudes, and so on... So, I started to humiliate myself and believe me, this humiliation started to give me pleasure somehow. I was trapped in a cycle where I created situations to humiliate myself and then I suffered.

Then something happened. I met a man 2.5 years ago and he was exactly the perfect example of the object of my self-abasement. But things turned out the way I didn't expect. He didn't humiliate me, he didn't belittle me, he didn't harass me, he wasn't rude to me. He saw me, my inner pain, he showed me his own wounds. He was there for me, he supported me when I cried.

Here's what I can't figure out right now. That man has been so good to me that I have become so attached to him, I can say that I'm co-dependent now. I don't want to live without him, I want to go with him wherever he goes, I want to do what he does. We have been spending so much time together for the last 2.5 years. He has become the center of my life. It's kind of a bromance-like relationship or sometimes I call it ""philia"", he is straight and he is not a sexual object for me, BUT I'm so confused. I really have a hard time understanding if I'm in love with this man, if I'm really gay, or if something else is going on, like after all these years of experience, I was shocked to meet such a person or something.

I have been in therapy for 2.5 years. EMDR has helped me a lot to get rid of my childhood traumas, but unfortunately, I feel too frozen to move now. Where have all my emotions gone, where are my sexual urges, where have my positive emotions gone, who am I, what do I want? I am completely in the unknown and my depression is getting deeper and deeper each day.

I really need someone to talk to me, even if you can't offer a solution. I want to hear something.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/17prlq9/im_almost_flipping_out/,t2_ncugab1vv,2023-11-07 18:48:30,8,2
"Should I switch to another psychiatrist? If yes, do you have recos?","I've been seeing this St. Luke's-based psychiatrist since August 2018. She diagnosed me with Persistent Depressive Disorder and ADHD (I dunno which type but maybe combined?). Now I've told her nearly everything about me, like the fact that I was bullied by my peers and physically and emotionally abused by my parents as a child. Last Friday, my mom hit me repeatedly in the head for ""talking back to her"". My dad told me I deserved to be beaten up kasi I ""was egging on my mom"". I asked my psychiatrist for help through text but received none (it's been 5 days since I texted her, but still no reply haist). Our sessions are basically listening to me talk about what happened to me since our last session and then after my 1hr is up she gives me my prescriptions (I take 5mg vortioxetine and 50mg quetiapine/night for my depression and 36mg Concerta/day for my ADHD). My entire family is forcing me to make peace with my parents even though I'm not yet emotionally ready for a reconnection. With no help forthcoming from anyone, I feel trapped and there are times wherein I think nothing makes sense. These past few days I've been more irritable/moody than usual, and I'm also somewhat more passively suicidal than I normally am (existential angst + childhood trauma lol). I haven't told my psychiatrist about this new development though because I feel like she doesn't really care, what with her radio silence on my latest text and her demeanour during our sessions. Also, my psychiatrist charges 4k/session, which is really too much IMO. All these are seriously making me want to switch psychiatrists, but do you guys think doing so would be wise/advisable? If yes, do you guys have recos (pls include the price huhu)?",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/liyyhv/should_i_switch_to_another_psychiatrist_if_yes_do/,t2_3scvvcay,2021-02-13 19:34:08,2,1
Undiagnosed.,"[I'm 15 and I badly want to have an access to a mental health professional since I've been extremely related with every symptom/sign, in the likes of BPD and ADHD comorbidity, but I don't know how I will have.]


I prefer to keep my name private. Call me Paul.

Lumaki ako sa Lolo at Lola ko, my mother gave birth at me at the age of nineteen, she didn't finished her first college course because of the pregnancy. 11 months after I was born, I had a brother and they have to give me to my grandparents since they really are not that economically and mentally stable at that time and my grandparents live in such an above stable living.

I have been there for nine years, it was a conservative household, and I was eight when I discovered I'm not a straight boy. I have always hidden it, my queer identity has always been suppressed inside. For 5 years, I studied in a Christian school which caused me to suppress my sexuality more. There were jokes of disownments kasi rin, kaya sobrang natakot ako.

When I came back to my parents at the age of ten, my Mom already finished her college and has been practice teaching (her course is Education). I was so naïve, 'di ko alam kung anong ieexpect ko sa mga magulang ko, since hindi naman kami ganoon ka-close.

That's when I've experienced kung paano yung feeling ng na sa laylayan. We lived in an impoverished community, squatter ba kung tawagin. At that time, dalawa na yung nakababata kong kapatid.

It was a violent and extreme household, mom knew I was gay, and she really doesn't care, my Dad too, except that he always use his ""tolerance"" against me.

Linggo-linggo, palaging away, not only verbally but also physically. I think it was 2016, where it really peaked, yung violence sa household, yung pisikalan, yung siraan ng gamit sa bahay, basagan ng plato, baliktarin ng mesa sa hapag, and even pagbabato ng mga gamit at damit sa labas ng bahay. The anger issues of my father made my Mom emotionally dismissive and extreme to us as well. At that time, yung laging na sa isip ko, paano nakakayanan ng nanay ko yung ganoon. Not only the abuse, but the quality of life that our father has given to us. Linggo-linggo mangungutang sa kapitbahay, sa mga kamag-anak, tsismis doon, tsismis dito.

It was a very extreme environment, na I wasn't even able to pity myself anymore, but to pity my two younger brothers and a year after that, our youngest brother was born. He also got to somehow, shortly sought the unhealthiness of our family.

Last year, my Mom and Dad separated, because my Mom's family urged her to let go of the 16-year old toxic relationship they had, since it got to a point where there have been death threats and threats of our personal things getting destroyed and thrown.

After that, my grandfather disowned me as well because of finally outing myself as a queer.

From Mandaluyong, we transferred to Tarlac.

My Mom is still now a teacher in Mandaluyong, since it's really not an easy least process to transfer, but I'm really glad that we have been in an economically stable place now, a thing that we didn't have when we were our father.

I'm currently taking care of my brother full-time, until face-to-face classes go back, and it's very mentally tiring as well.

Since hindi naman sila kasal, the conjugation was never addressed properly.

Four months ago, we found out that my five-year old brother has an ADHD.

I don't really know if it is because of the environment we had, but he's yet to have his therapy.

Maybe what I'm experiencing right now is a traumatic response, since I assure you that everything was just so mentally scarring. The gaslight, abuse and narcissism I have been fazed into was never great.

Every day is emotionally painful, draining, and so hard to cope, there's this constant fear of abandonment, impulsive (sexual) behaviors, self-harm, the inability to build up stable relationships and friendships, violent mood swings and a never-ending struggle with self-image.

Me and my brother share absolute the same page when it comes to inability to focus and be firm and stable,.and to habe extreme racing thoughts, differing that I just have violent and detrimental ones.

Even though we're in an economically stable place now, my mind still re-operates in my past.

Suicidal ideation has been a part of the everyday struggle.

Into the Void,"TL;DR 30ish guy venting out about life in general, relationships, expenses, career etc...

So 2021 is fast approaching and I never felt so empty more than ever. My lady, whom I live with for 7 years keep pressuring me this past few weeks about our future and whatnot. I’m on the stage where I felt that I didn’t plan to grow old this far. During my early teens I was an edgy depressive kid before I met her. I’ll be honest, I suck at work, Never finish school, hopped between different call centers and odd jobs. I just recently discovered working from home and I am earning pretty decent but I’m still on the part where I can only afford things for myself and my family back home since its the holiday season I plan to give whatever blessings I earned. During the govt mandated lockdown, me and my girlfriend stayed at home every single day and I think that were too busy and not minding anything outside of work at all. Helped her since she has multiple jobs as a VA, I paid the utilities, she saved for herself. Recently, she is getting a little colder and pretty vocal about her future with me, the fact that she’s at her mid 30’s by next year. Over the past two weeks, she go out atleast 8 times, atleast an hour drive to her friend’s place which consists of two lesbo relationships, a mistress and a single mom. I will be honest I have nothing against them or any kind of bad judgement to them, I even treated them as friends as well when we go out of town. Maybe, I’m the type of individual who don’t give a damn about other people’s business but I think they are otherwise when it comes to my girlfriend. I guess her friends frustations when it comes to their relationship status are being transferred and they release their stress to my girl and shes becoming a shock absorber in her circle. That’s why I am getting a ton of shit on the receiving end whenever she comes home. I can’t blame them for that I had alot of mistakes and dissapointments too when it comes to my character. I smoke, I get easily angry at things then I start stress eating, I snore so loud and she can’t go to sleep, I am easily irritated at things and I’m a very pessimistic person but that’s how it is. I see things as it is, when I’m happy, I’m happy, when I’m mad I take a few breaths then I will be fine. I think I grew maturely and adapt to my surroundings since I don’t have time with my friends either, I have a very small circle of professional homies, who are busy with their career which means I’m the loser between the 5 of us. lol What I don’t do, is go out and hang out with different girls or cheat on my girl, I hate toxic masculinity too. I don’t have any vices or addiction, I don’t physically confront her since I’m a product of a broken home as well and my mom was physically abused at a very young stage of her relationship with my biological father (never met him though). So to step back, almost had a kid with this lady I’m living with during the early part of our relationship but it came up stillborn so back then I told myself that for me to raise a kid I have to establish our life first. During those times, we agreed to never marry until we did the things that we want such as; travel, buy a house and each cars, latest gadgets and all of these superficial things. That’s fine with me atleast we don’t have a responsibility for someone elses life. This stage of my life is becoming so weird to me, I have anxiety since my 2nd mom, my aunt, died at the first quarter of the year, If its covid we don’t know, since shes undergoing dialysis for almost a year at the time it happened. I felt like my love ones, the people I grew up with are dying within the next couple of years, I don’t know but what I can guarantee is that I’m going to be left alone with nothing. I bid my time and found no purpose here. I am suppose to be dead by now and I find it weird that the only reason I exist is because I chose to pursue meaningless things in life. Like the usual get youself a family, a career, a house, be on the latest trends. I don’t know whats in it for me but i’m losing it every single day. Lastly, I don’t think it matter but the only reason I choose to live right now is because of my pets. I feed them, I buy them the good stuff, I bathe them, we play, I cater to them every single moment of my life; whenever I wake up until prior to bedtime. They are the only shining light of hope for me this time, that’s why I don’t give in to dark thoughts. They are here when no one else dares to be by my side. I can’t leave them and I have nowhere else to go. If I go home, I can’t even sustain my lifestyle. Fuck it, we don’t have a steady internet connection back home. Anyway, I appreciate your time reading my story so far atleast I left my digital footprint this time around, whatever happens, happens.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/kk4jgm/into_the_void/,t2_2in20e8e,2020-12-26 03:29:22,19,12
I Snarled at Papa,"Hooooboy this gonna be a long one. 

But tldr, I hate my dad due to a lifetime of abuse and because of my hatred for him, my mental health is at its breaking point.

For some context, my dad is a pathetic, lousy excuse of a parent who doesn't deserves kids. Actually, both my parents were.

When they had me, they were 18. Daddy dearest couldn't hold a job, much less graduate from school so my grandparents from his side offered to pay and take care of me until he finishes. (Mom's side was not supportive so they left us alone)

Now he took that as a free get out of jail card. Like he thought he wouldn't need to spend ANYTHING. When my sister came along, his mindset did not change and this meant he didn't pay for what we needed. He did pay for some things, like diapers, the occasional milk, some clothes but he NEVER gave money for the house, the bills, the food and eventually he never paid for our tuition when we started school.

At this point my parents split and it was decided we stay with dad because my grandparents got really attached to us and were financially stable. 

So, here begins my dad's attempt to raise a kid and it turns out, he's an abusive POS.

1. He would make me and my sister do chores, like do his laundry and cook him meals. We do anything wrong, verbal abuse.

2. After school when he picks us up, he makes us go out and buy cigarettes and coke on our own and if we get it wrong, shouting for hours ensues.
3. When he started working in a call center, his sleeping sched got whacked out of orbit. To help him sleep, he'd force us to stay in the room, made us massage his back or run our fingers through his disgusting gel covered head. And he would make us stay for hours.

4. Rather than being encouraging about school, he ignored us and disengaged from helping us with assignments. Like actively tried to avoid it. Now when he does help, on the rare occasion, he calls us bobo - kaso di naman din niya alam? Sino tlaga yung bobo? 

5. He's a disrespectful ah towards lola. His own mother. Like the kind na bastos that should be exorcised. Lakas niya mag preach na irespeto siya since he's our parent but ganun siya sa sariling ina niya. I took offense to that, Lola was sweet, makulit at pasaway minsan but she loved us and took care of us. She worked hard and made sure we stayed at a good school and had good food. Pero takot siya kay lolo. Ugh. He's a separate problem on his own but that's a story for another time.

6. Likes to gaslight, lie and manipulate us. He tried to turn us against Mama but thankfully, we got our brains from her and not him and saw right through his bs. Says they went to court for custody, alright where's the proof? None. My lola called that one out pretty fast. Says mama cheated on him, well he cheated on her too. Wayyy before she ever did. Says he fought for his life for us. What tf was he fighting? Says he worked hard. For what? He doesn't even pay for anything. He mostly spent his money on branded clothes, shoes and cars. Always. Stupid. Cars.

7. Had a string of exes that he all had abusive or toxic relations to. He'd tell them he loved them but calls them stupid or slap them. I once had to comfort a woman 3x my age. It wasn't much but I gave her a hug. I wasn't even 13 yet.

8. Control freak. Loves to micromanage.

9. Has temper tantrums. Like full-blown tantrums. If things don't go his way, he would thrash his room.

But that's not all. There's more but the one example that really stood out to me, that made me change was this:

10. My sister said something once. The kind that little kids do because they don't have 100% mastery over their own language. It was harmless, she didn't want to go home yet because she was having fun with other kids but he took it the wrong way and the next morning he was beating her head on the stairs.

That's where it started, I think. Whatever affection I still had, went out like a light. And something else just grew in its place. Its dark and heavy and as the years grew by it festered.

If it wasn't for our Aunt (his sister) I think I would have turned out far worse. She took us in like we were her own. Straight out of college and right into working, she helped feed us, take care of us, took us to the doctor and brought us gifts that we genuinely loved. She taught us to be responsible, to be kind and understanding, to be patient.

She grew to be the mom we needed and I am so grateful for her.

But still, that feeling was still there and I knew as long as he was still there, it would be too.

As the years went by and we got older, we started rebelling against him. Fuelled by our burning desire not to end up like our parents and not waste the opportunity mom and lola gave us, we did our best.

One day, we got into an argument and he slapped me. As a kid I would have bowed out immediately but I wasn't a kid anymore. This time I could have slapped him back, but I didn't. I goaded him. Crazy I know, go ahead, do it again. If he hit hard enough and there was a mark, I can show it to lolo, to the police, to anyone really. I would have destroyed his standing within the family entirely, made him worse than the outcast he already made himself to be for all his bs over the years. If only he gave me the chance.

My dad plays dirty, likes to intimidate people, hits those weaker than him, and lies any way he can. His bark was worse than his bite and I knew that he was a coward. 

He knew what I was doing and backed out, tried to excuse himself that it was just tough love. I didn't fall for it. I told him I am what he made me and if he knew better, then he should knock his delusional bs off and set himself straight because I will never support him. Never love him. Will never be there for him.

And I stood by it ever since and my sister has adopted a similar attitude. Her story is different from mine but we've come to the same standing.

When he demanded for us to drop everything, and I mean everything, whether it was school or work to come to him because he had a panic attack sa MRT, we didn't go. He also called us in the middle of the night, demanding to have us talk to him while he was driving to work.

When he asked for my help to help him propose to his partner, I turned him away.

When my youngest sibling was announced and he tried to get me to help support the baby financially and physically, me, a college student, who at the time was struggling financially as well because lola and lolo were retiring, I slammed him down with a big fat NO.

My youngest sib had two perfectly healthy parents who brought it upon themselves and we were NOT going to be responsible for THEIR actions. Daddy dearest had avoided us, its time he grew up and do right for his kids. I was livid, growling at him, and told him the only time I would take care of the young ones were if both of them were dead. He had a chance to make things right. It was too late for us. My sister and I hated his guts.

Over the last few years, dad has calmed down with his shenanigans. I'm glad he got some of his crap together when it comes to the kids. 

BUT. He still infuriates me. Just when he does something right, he takes 10 steps back. He and his partner does not contribute for the house bills. You'd think a well-adjusted adult would have the decency to share some amt considering how much electricity (aircon is on all the time), water and food they consume but nooo. They don't.

They also have no savings. They live paycheck to paycheck, on a neverending loop of credit cards to pay a mountain of debt from all the unnecessary crap they brought.

When he got sick, diagnosed with an illness I can't mention here, and his face got disfigured because of it, they had no savings at all. No insurance, nada. Who took care of that? My aunt and her hubby. The physical therapy he needed? Covered by the HMO I have for him.

He says they're still paying for his time at the hospital and that's why they couldn't give anything at home but we were the ones who spent on his MEDICAL NEEDS? 

Then the pandemic hit and I was stuck with their phone bill while they were out of work for 3 months. I had a phone from Dad's plan that I just finished paying for. Since the plan was done, they got a new one where I still get the sim and they get a new phone. Since they were out of work, they couldn't pay for it so surprise surprise, I ended up paying for the damn thing otherwise the sim I was using would be deactivated. Racked up 10k worth. All this while I was still helping pay for the house.

Unfortunately for him, I inherited his and my mom's temper and I was pissed. They still would not pay. Until now, I would have to pull and constantly remind their ungrateful asses to pay, if not me then at least for the house because my poor lola is taking the hit for them.

He also had surgery a few times. Each time, they did not pay. Even if the hosp was public and philhealth covered it, there were still fees to pay and I shelled out 30k in total. My lola and aunt did too.

Fast forward to a year later and lolo gets sick. We all contributed to his hosp bills and ongoing meds. Racked up 500k of bills. My aunt covered most of it, lola had made the trips to ask anyone for help and my sister and I gave 40k from our modest savings.

What did he do? He whined about driving my lola around. Whined about the money. Whined about selling his car so he can give something for the bills. The kicker was when he did sell the car, he only gave 15k and brought A NEW CAR. ARE YOU KIDDING ME.

Everything that I was bottling up, the festering feeling came to a head when my cat got died from liver failure. She was just 6yrs old and I was so heartbroken. I had her since college and she was more family to me than my own parents ever were. I cried for hours, like the ugly wretching crying. Until now it hurts. I loved her so much and she got me through the worst times. Now that she's gone I can't help but blow up. 

I've never shown my disgust at my dad before, I always kept a straight face but I can't control myself anymore. I end up becoming antagonistic towards him, I'm repulsed by physical contact and I am indifferent to his feelings. Every conversation ends up in a fight. My last one involved his treatment of the kids. I see myself in them, he orders them to do whatever now that they're old enough and I just outright snarled. 

I wanted to stop for the kids' sakes but its hard. If I force myself, I get headaches, migraines and on the worst occasion, a nosebleed. 

I've been told to forgive my dad but why should I? To keep the peace? Am I supposed to just lay down and be abused? Do nothing? As long as I live in this house my anger would never cease, my hatred runs deep and if it wasn't for my sisters I would have stooped to his level and bash a chair over his head a long time ago.

For him, I don't hesitate to play dirty. I will use anything against him. His mistakes, his insecurities, his fear and whatever is left of his genuine love for us that's been warped by his disgusting attitude.

I honestly do not like it when I do. I'm not proud of it but my dad rarely experiences the consequences of his own actions. Its from a combination of being a spoiled twit and entitled freak and because of that, I'm completely set on making a point that I won't tolerate his bs. To be a constant reminder of his actions that if he dared to try to do the same thing with our younger siblings, he better hope someone would be there for him on his deathbed because I sure won't.

And yes, I know its wrong but its hard to let go. Not when he still acts like a crappy human. I've been bottling this for years and was thinking as soon as we move out I'll need therapy. Lord knows I need it. I do. Honestly, my life isn't so bad minus my dad but its not healthy for me to have so much hatred. Its been affecting my mental health. There's only so much you can handle, ya know?

And I really do not want it to affect anything else so yeah, that's my story. If you've read to the end thanks for reading and I hope everything is okay with you.

Human nature is complicated and nobody is perfect but in the end we gotta do what's best, whatever it may be. So stay strong, you got this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/ucyrpi/i_snarled_at_papa/,t2_9vld12dk,2022-04-27 16:29:49,5,1
how do I help my friend with her self worth?,"Hi there, I hope this is ok to post here.

I'm really worried about my friend, K. She's been through some bad stuff since she was young, like, her mom is toxic and manipulative, used to abuse her physically and emotionally to the point where now K's low view about herself is basically an echo of the stuff her mom says to her. She also has a younger sibling, who K used to be very close to, who's gotten into hard drugs and is in and out of jail. So all of this basically piles on top of her.

We're currently in graduate school where the exams can be pretty tough. She tries her hardest and you can see it. The professors see it too. But she barely passes courses. This results in her getting extremely down on herself, saying she's useless and that she should just drop out now. (Which, I can absolutely understand and see where that comes from.)

There are some days too where things pile up on her, so she leaves class early instead of staying back to chat like we always do, so we don't see her break down. Normally, she has a beautiful and kind and helpful personality that brightens a room, so when it's been shadowed out, you immediately notice. I'll text her after class wondering where she went and won't hear back, but I understand her needing to shut down for a couple hours. Once she does respond though, it's with ""it's dumb, I don't deserve (being happy), other people have it worse, I'm just being a little bitch, I'm done trying (to get better)"", etc.

She reminds me of myself when I was younger. We both were too kind and giving with our friends, which left us trampled on and left behind when those friends would hang out. I would also be down on myself, say I don't deserve things and spiral out of control. But I was very fortunate with my support system and went to therapy so I learned how to get myself out. my first step was changing my mentality about myself, which I know is a lot more difficult for other people. I've been trying to help her with this but sadly, the echo from her mother is rooted deep in her, so no matter what, she's incredibly harsh on herself and nothing can convince her otherwise.

I've asked her to see a psychiatrist, but we live in a busy, populated area so her appointments are only once a month. I was lucky with my therapist and was able to call her whenever I had an off day, and I believe K needs that support as well. However, if she doesn't hear back from the psychiatrist within a day, she thinks they've ""run away"" because of how she's ""too much"" and won't follow up with them. (Which has happened to her before.) I've tried to tell her she should follow up because they may just be busy, but she brushes me off by laughing about it or says ""we'll see. I'll get better soon, I've gotten this far""

I don't believe she's immediately suicidal, but she has made jokes recently that makes me worry deeply, which I've expressed to her. I've tried to be gentle and slow with her when she spirals, but she'll respond with ""nah I just need to suck it up, I'm overreacting and being a little bitch"" (which is exactly what her mom says to her.) If I try to do tough love and be straight with her, no beating around the bush, she'll laugh it off or brush it off with ""I'll be okay by tomorrow, thanks for the pep talk."" 

I'm never going to abandon her. She needs this support because she has no one else. But this is starting to affect my mental health too. I'm worried though if I step away for a day, she'll think it's because she's ""too much"" and will just be upset with herself again, which I don't want at all.

How can I approach this? How do I convince her that she's worthy and deserving of good, stable mental health? That she's not a burden on anyone and she should love herself? I know I cannot change her overnight, nor can I force her to go to therapy. I just need something, anything, to help her. Any advice, good or bad (like telling me off), will be appreciated.

"Narcissistic in laws, supporting my partner","

So, I feel like a bad guy here but I think I was meant to marry into the family I did. My in-laws are definitely narcissistic, all of them except my husband who happens to be the scapegoat. He is the sweetest and most kindest person who deserves good in the world. He continuously tried to make both parties happy but drew a line when he saw his parents treat me the way he gets treated and we moved out. Rather kicked out in the most terrible way. 

Just a little side note living with in laws in my culture is for the parents. It isn’t a nice thing for a married couple. For the record my husband paid, the bills and gave “rent” along with covering food expenses. We get trashed talk and made to seem like the evil, manipulative bad daughter in law for wanting to have separate living situations. (In religion I have a right to it which everyone glosses over). Despite it I wanted to live together and have a happy life, that quickly ended because of my NMIL.

She once was a victim of my NFIL and his abuse where she soon became a narcissist herself.

What does she/has done?

- Plays Victim despite causing every problem
- Takes no accountability
- Gets jealous very quickly and easily
- Because of her unhappy marriage would always say “why does she get to live good when I lived like xyz”
- talks about my personal health in a very hurtful manner 


Whatever the case, I still didn’t give a reaction to anything. My FIL and I had a great relationship which my MIL definitely didn’t like. I treated him as my father. Mind you, I would happily serve them, despite completing my last semester of schooling. This was also discussed before marriage and they made it seem like they were up to date people. I realize they actually lied. It was made it to look like they value my education and a career woman. 

It drives them nuts that I don’t react to their stupidity or insults. Which is why I believe I was meant for them. I also feel like I was meant to help my husband, but I’m his own he actually realized they were narcissistic only because he saw his treatment happen to me. 

They were trying to make me into their maid and nanny. Literally I was expected to be waiting for my MIL and greet her whenever she came from work. I did not do that because I got school. I have priorities. If I happen to be there when you come home of course I’ll welcome you but don’t expect it when you don’t get that from your own kids. 

It hit me and my husband that they thought I’d be easy to control because I am very loving and caring. They realized I am that but also strong willed and will not compromise my life for theirs. Reason why we realized this?

My husband has been financially abused by his father, as well as physically and mentally so that he can’t leave. He was their scapegoat. He was treated very significantly different from his brother. One was the golden child and he was the scapegoat. He was expected to always give more and do more which he did with a clean mind. The realization finally hit when I asked him “why would they get you married to someone who is strong and smart?” Meaning why would they let their scapegoat/sacrifice a chance to realize everything.

Whatever the case, when we got kicked out it was because my NFIL trashed talked my family. Words were used I never learned. He wanted me to hear and he was never like that with me. It was yelling and cursing etc. I never said a word. I stared at him with tears. The situation got violent. Things being thrown our stuff etc. He knew he messed up and being who he is there was no turning back. 

Traits of my NFIL:
- became close to my dad but wanted what he had so made him an enemy (he envied how we always give our dad respect and value. There is no my or yours with finances. It’s a joint family and that too willingly. We are a healthy family that believes in transparency and talking out and being polite. Complete opposite of my in laws)
- talks bad about you if you’re not on his side
- falls trap to my MIL whispering her twisted thoughts because she pinches his ego
- wants full control 
- always has to be right 
- there’s more but you guys get it

Fast forward my husband and I are in our own place. We are still processing the pain. We are both family people.

My husband now has a chance to be someone. He has a chance to become confident and who he is meant to be. I plan on being a supportive partner. If he needs to not work that’s fine. I will support us until he can be who he loves. His mind was always focused on survival and it breaks me always. I know if I didn’t come in the picture he maybe would have never known his parents are narcissistic. But, the fact that despite everything that happened, I didn’t let them phase me. They say outlandish things to get a reaction but it doesn’t work. 

My husband used to get his phone blown up about bad mouthing me. They try to make us have problems by emasculating him and making him feel less of a man. But it doesn’t work. He learned to not respond or react. 


Btw his siblings are also narcissistic . I can’t help but wonder, now that the scapegoat is gone. Does the golden child become it?

Anyways, I need some advice on how to stay strong for my partner. I want him to finally live for himself. I plan to focus on my career goals. Mentally I’ve begun to depersonalize so therapy will begin. I’m traumatized by a lot of behavior. But my partner needs me. I am burnt out but I’m pushing through for him. 

I am financially supporting along with handling everything household related and meals. My husband is hardworking but he needs this time. Please send me some encouragement and advice.


I thought of calling his parents but I plan to gray rock as usual. The purpose is to have that slight communication for in case anything happens to anyone. What do you guys think?

Can’t help but apply normal logic and apply my family values but I think I should follow and support my husband. He knows his family better.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/wl7l6y/narcissistic_in_laws_supporting_my_partner/,t2_5q64h98z,2022-08-11 04:16:15,0,1
"I became a derangedly, delusional, obsessed stalker and I need to let this out anonymously","Disclaimer: A long vent. A ***very*** long one.

And I'm not the type of person who usually posts anything about myself online, much less something personal. I hate being vulnerable. But after what's practically a cocktail of medications I've been taking that's increasing, decreasing in dosage, getting replaced, having to find a substitute for because the usual brand I buy is out of stock. You name it. And none of them seem to work, but I have a lot of negative side effects? I'm just tired. 

I understand bitches who would doubt the validity of your, my, struggles exist. Fuck, there are still plenty others who believe mental health is a sham. And I'm not mentally well enough to handle that. 

But today, I give in. 

A little lotta bit about me:

* I've been symptomatic of plenty of mental illnesses from a very young age.
* I'm diagnosed with BD type 1. 
* Under evaluation for schizoaffective disorder.
* I have a history of dissocial behavior.
* I am under evaluation for a personality disorder, but god knows what PD that is. My psychiatrist wouldn't tell. Feels like I'm collecting mental illness like pokemon at this point.
* I have a grandiose sense of self and pretty vain, especially when manic.
* I grew up in a religious family. This is important.

I'll try to keep it short. 

**TW: future mentions of abuse, self harm, stalking**

Besides the non-religious aspect of my life which caused me to get beat up until I was forced to pretend to be religious and secretly self-harm, my family actually treats me well. So well that unless religion is brought up, it feels like I'm growing up in a healthy environment. 

Despite that, I was aggressive. I had hurt other kids when I was a kid. I did everything I can to cause them pain. And if they caused me pain, I make sure to double it and give it back to them. I would never do that to a child now that I'm an adult, self-aware, and know better.

But one thing to note is that I lack empathy and I never felt guilt my whole life. All my relationships had always been transactional and I believe it's because I despise vulnerability. Maybe I subconsciously instilled in myself that I won't allow anyone to hurt me ever again. I could never relate to people on a personal level or form meaningful relationships with anyone and I do not wish to. 

And this is one of the many reasons why I'm so exhausted.

Make it make sense. If I'm against relationships so much, then why am I so obsessive?

There was this foreign boy in my class. I didn't give a fuck about him at all. There were even times I talked shit about him. He was pretty confused all the time. He couldn't understand simple concepts. Shit, he wasn't even physically attractive to me at all. 

My ""friends"" would usually make fun of him. Honestly, I was the lesser bitch out of all of them because I kept a more open mind. ""Maybe he's experiencing brain fog? He could be medicated for a medical condition."" 

I was projecting. I know firsthand how it feels to experience constant confusion and brain fog due to being heavily medicated with shit that sounds like poison. Still, I had no interest in him.

""May crush ako kay Kian."" One of my ""friends,"" who I partially disliked due to her pushiness about religion, admitted. Kian is that foreign boy they made fun of. And ever since then, all hell broke loose.

It started off with observing him, questioning what makes him attractive to her.

It just so happens that during this time, Kian would often interact with me for whatever reason. And maybe it's because I'm a natural at being nosy, but I thought it was a great opportunity to ask him personal questions.

I found out he's an atheist and bisexual along with a ton of other information that I know my ""friend"" would disagree with. In guise of being a concerned friend, I let her know all these things. My goal was to make him as unattractive to her as possible and I don't know why. What was I trying to achieve with this, really? No, really, what the fuck did I expect? I had fun doing that though. I was tired of her delusions (ironic) and how I had to pretend to ship them together because everyone else in the group did.

I succeeded. But at that point, it wasn't enough. I can't stand not being around him for even a day. 

We have plenty of interactions that I'm still not sure if they mean something or if I'm just giving it meaning. I honestly still feel like he was breadcrumbing me. These are a few of those:

* That time he randomly massaged my head while we were in class and I was writing down notes
* How he asks me for help all the time, even though his friends are more than capable of helping him
* Random middle of the night messages about non-academic stuff, though they only really last like 5 minutes and we don't talk much about anything else other than academics in real life
* The few times he offered to walk me home
* How his friends seem to act different when he's around me

It doesn't help that the terms ""delulu,"" and ""obsessed"" became popular and colloquialized because now when I say I think I'm delusional and obsessed, people think I'm joking. My actual friends still think I'm not serious about this and they laugh when I try to open up about it. They think he's my crush and they ship us. NO, I HAVE IT BAD AND MY PSYCHIATRIST APPOINTMENT IS TAKING TOO LONG. I fucking tried stalking the man back home. I TRIED TO STALK HIM BACK HOME.

I had a raging fit and meltdown when I found out he started dating this girl because I don't know why. Just to completely move on after a day. Literally the day after my meltdown, I went back to not giving a fuck about him because he's boring now. Until they broke up. 

I started writing this as I was sobbing because I can't have him with me alone. He's always with his friends. Unhinged, I know. He randomly called me in the middle of the night to talk about life and stuff. Then he actually invited me over to hangout the other day and I arrived there thinking it's just us, but nope, his friends were there. 

I hate how he has friends. I hate how he has family, even though his family aren't here. I hate how he interacts with other people in a daily basis. I hate how I know more about him than his friends do, yet we don't even talk much. 

I want to be the only person in his life. I don't even like this dude. I don't even wanna date this dude. The thought of being romantic with this dude repulses me. So what the fuck is this all about and why am I so obsessed with him?

I'm just getting worse and I try to manage my mental state, but I'm failing. I don't see my psychiatrist until next month.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/1az9rx6/i_became_a_derangedly_delusional_obsessed_stalker/,t2_uvzcoivji,2024-02-25 08:10:08,6,7
I need help,"Hello! How do I recover from a depressive episode?

I am not diagnosed but I've been showing symptoms for a while now. I honestly have no idea what to do.

I currently have suicidal thoughts and crying spells. The thoughts have been around for years now, mainly passive, but they worsened this year. The crying spells are new, they started around the end of our semester, stopped, and went back just this month.

I also find it hard to do some basic tasks. They've become overwhelming. Sometimes I would plan to do something but end up not doing it because I just can't. The thought of doing something ""productive"" makes me want to throw up.

I have responsibilities right now and I'm afraid I won't be able to handle them properly. I have org responsibilities and I messaged an org member last night that I'm having a hard time and immediately uninstalled messenger. Now I can't bring myself to reinstall it and want to escape from my responsibilities for a moment.

Physically, my chest really feels heavy. There are times that throat feels tight and I can't breathe properly. When I (successfully) start doing something, I just cry. Yesterday, when I was finally able to bring myself to take a shower, I cried. Just a while ago, when I was eating, I wanted to cry. While washing the dishes and doing my chores, I just wanted to cry.

I also can't open this up to my family. We've been through a lot. My sister has past trauma that I don't want to go into detail. She got counselling (a faith-based one) and she hated it since the counselor knows my mother and my sister told me that the counselor and my mom would always talk at the end of every session. My sister's suspicions are they'd talk about what my sister talker about. It's really fucked up. This happened years ago and this is why my sister doesn't want to go/believe in therapy at all.

I don't want to go as far as call my mom abusive. She's trying her best but it's just, she's done a lot of shitty things that she doesn't want to admit are wrong. We're also kind of in an awkward phase right now. She's mad at me and said a lot of things yesterday while I was staring at my phone looking up ways how to kill myself. I'm numb to them but it's just funny yet fucked up at the same time that she's shouting at me while I'm just trying to keep myself alive.

I'm ready to die. If someone offers me an easy way out, I'd take that with no questions asked. But I also don't want to die. I just want to disappear for some time and reappear when I'm ready. I'm just not ready right now.

I feel like people expect a lot from me and I hate it. I hate feeling helpless and writing this already feels hard. 

I have plans to see a mental health professional. Maybe in two weeks when my mom is at work. I can't do it right now since I don't have privacy here and I still haven't worked out my thoughts and what I'm currently feeling. I don't even know what I'm going to say when I do go to a therapist.

I uninstalled messenger but left facebook in my phone. Staring at the chat icon fills me with dread and I can't bring myself to reinstall it. I want to talk to my friends but I don't want to see the replies (from the org members). I'm scared that I'm disappointing them.

I'm sorry for the long rant, but I really need help. I just don't know where to start.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/p594fv/i_need_help/,t2_4e9eiyz3,2021-08-16 12:40:53,11,6
Just a bottled up vent with frustrations and such...,"I (21yr M) has a lot of trauma that i think can be classified as PTSD that begun during childhood and frequen abuse from family persisted till today...  


As a kid or before I was even born, my dad used to be a drug addict who slept all day, drank with friends, and basically neglected me a lot, my mom on the other hand who at the time is a dental student trying her best to graduate.

During my younger years, we were more or less broke and barely coming by, me and my mom was underweight as a student and my dad had been using his work money he earned from the butchers for mostly his vices, and would fight consistently with my mom and sometimes beating me up randomly back then.

During this time, my aunt from my mom's side who saw what was happening tempted my mom to flirt via e-mail to an OFW, basically she did that reluctantly out of frustration due to the constant stuff my dad had been doing back then and to also make my Karen of an aunt shut up. She exchanged a few simple e-mails with this one OFW and received a few gifts from this person. My dad at that time caught wind of the conversations and e-mails, and began to develop paranoia, hallucinations and etc which became worse due to his vices.

The years that followed after my mom had gotten her own clinic, both my parents have been fighting nonstop usually involving frequent visits to the local medical center, police station, my mom's side family home in the provinces. In these fights we end up severly wounded, with a lot of our personal belongings getting destroyed by him. I usually end up as a bargaining chip to either one of my parents while being neglected by both. The younger me was so naive and was too forgiving to the atrocities around me... I'd ask for help from my dad's side relatives to stop him sometimes, bring him to rehab or put him in jail but they were extremely forgiving and pitied my dad despite me and my mom having so much wounds and bruises... My dad's family even victim blamed both of us on why my dad is like this due to the fact my mom technically cheated on him for a while. Every day back then as a child, I'd stay up, worried that my dad may kill me or my mom or that we wont live to see another day...

Both my parents and entire family paid no mind to me at all (I was molested by a crazy drug addicted neighbor at a young age, luckily i wasnt raped since i ran away after he loosened his grip on me)... While my dad, he acted like every word he said was absolute, and if i failed to obey perfectly, i'd get shoved in sack, beaten up or i'd get tortured by having him use my teeth or nails to open his bottles of beer. No one stopped him or stood up for me... I once had gotten a struck by dengue as a kid, forced to go to school because if i didnt ""he'd look bad"" wherein i got hit because i ended up convulsing at class due to extreme high fever while vomiting (one of my aunt's who saw me suffered got me treated for this while i was confined for nearly a month). I also got multiple bite wounds from stray dogs from getting yelled at to go buy him beer from a far away street wherein I was hit and victim blamed by my dad for not knowing what to do during my third grade of elementary (The concerned neighbors who witnessed the events were the ones who rushed me to the medical center to get injected with a vaccine for anti-rabies just in case). I also had gotten a severe infection on my hand from opening up a liquor bottle for him wherein i wasn't able to write properly at school for a while since it took an entire sem without it getting treated because of him taking the earnings of my mom and using most of the budget on his vices.

The punishments i most fondly remember as a kid was that I would be beaten up, put in a sack, have my personal belongings be it school works or toys destroyed in front of me, not being allowed to eat meals for a few days, getting electrocuted by a tazer from time to time (I couldn't properly write anymore nor hold a pencil because of this), and slashing a bit of my torso and legs since my bruises and wounds would be hidden behind my uniform.

Anyways, back to topic, my situation got worse when my dad was caught at a checkpoint with his friends carrying illegal drugs which got shown on the news via unang hirit. the parents of my classmates, the neighbors and my classmate would avoid me like the plague or treat me like a pariah during the duration of my entire elementary class because of this, I would get bullied as well or beaten up too by some of my classmates at the time because of how I could be possibly doing something illegal since my dad was caught doing crime, and I was always treated like some sort of villain everytime. even my teachers back then were avoiding me due to the speculations and such. My grandma had bailed out my dad almost immediately due to her pity for him. During this time as well, I was belittled by my family and consistently compared to another person's kid and used as a bad example for academics because i couldnt properly write normally, i had barely passing grades or extremely low ones due to multiple absences due to my family situation and so on...

My naivety in false belief in happy families ended however when one day, he came back home, extremely drunk or under the effect of drugs, and without reason at 2 or 3 am midnight, he broke the bedroom doors, dragged me and my mom by the legs as we got scratches from the rough floor.  
He was as usual accusing my mom of cheating as he was holding up a knife, and he began to attack me for no reason till he yelled at me ""HINDI KITA ANAK!"" he tied my hands up, pulled me up, poured some fuel on a box with my toys and various belongings on it and began to burn it...  
as he took the knife and slowly stabbed it on my arm, i was screaming, my mom and relatives around the area did nothing to help while my mouth was covered with cloth. he then to proceed to slowly stab my chest with it... till a few of the stray cats i was feeding began to pounce on my dad which gave me some time to escape...

I ran all the way out towards the barangay hall where they would apply medicine on me but I saw my dad giving chase to me with reddish eyes while holding a knife. when he saw that i was in the hall he ran back home and hid. I was brought to my aunt later on that night and stayed there for four months, skipping classes somewhat. I was too afraid of people at this point in time. I then learnt how to use my aunt's laptop at that time and became addicted to online games to cope I suppose or to do something else than idling away the hours hiding from my parents. It was there that my fingers which were stiff from tazer punishment was slowly but surely able to move properly enough for me to hold a pen and write but with bad handwriting. Basically I ended up coping by becoming a shut-in at a young age with video games and some shows to slowly take my mind off the trauma for a while.

By the fourth month of my time there, I had to be returned back to my parents to go to school, Even if i didnt want to return, I ended up getting forced by both my parents... I developed a regular habit to avoid staying near the house wherein i get an empty box and sleep in it for the night be it rain or shine since i feel intense fear and my chest ends up too heavy. No one in my family would look for me, so i kept this up for a few months till a family friend reported what i was doing to my parents and they would yell at me for embarassing them.  
I at least changed schools when going into highschool to at least start a new life to avoid getting bullied, but at this point i was still extremely cautious and I didnt know who to properly tell all this to out of fear in getting belittled, victim blamed, and so on which drove me to failed suicide attempts and my parents yelled at me for being papansin... (They even told me that ill go to hell or that im a demon since i dont have enough faith kay God raw even though i pray desperately every day for things to get better like my life depends on it.)

By this time I was about to be grade 7 or first year in highschool at this time however, during the first week of my highschool, my parents had quarrelled so hard that they temporarily separated with my mom taking me to the provinces to her family for a while with me missing out the first two semesters of my first year of highschool.

Her entire family was blaming me for all my mother's suffering and pains, and when i thought my mom would comfort me, she too ended up blaming me as the reason on why she keeps on getting hurt and her clinic frequently gets property damage (wherein most of her staff quits because of absurd verbal abuse and accusations my dad says due to his belief that my mom is still cheating)  
Everytime he would get arrested, he would easily get bailed out by his mom or grandma...

And meanwhile my mom, under the influence of her sister, went gung-ho on all the cards which made her gained terrible records on majority of the bank accounts she owns so she then took mine and what little i managed to save up there... So basically I still live with a terrible record on my bank account too and future bank accounts because of what she did... (with g-cash being the most viable option i have in the present)

One of the things i managed to however get from that irresponsible habit of hers is my own desktop with an internet connection.

From there I continued being a shut-in for a while at my mom's relative's house. I dont usually leave the room i sleep at since i would get terrible glares from her family and her and i would eat their leftovers once everyone has gone to sleep.

During my time as a shut-in i got addicted to a certain online multiplayer game and from there, I slowly developed my social and communication skills from the players ive talked to or conversed with. from this time, I realized they also had similar yet different cases from mine, so I just began desiring to befriend em because it felt like I made proper friends and acquaintances to be ""myself"" with and talk about my wounds with. These friends of mine despite their problems, slowly but surely inspired me to try to get my life back in order and gave me a goal to want to reach despite my sorry state. It was the conceptual goal of proper revenge, not in the revenge of harming others to comfort myself, but the revenge wherein I got to ensure that my future would be a happier one, a future wherein i could have and experience a warm and happy family that trusts each other far away from this mess of a situation, with my second goal being to help others in similar yet different situations due to my gratitude for the friends I met online that helped me get through that rough time somewhat...

From that point on, I formed a goal and a dream of avenging my younger self by getting a happy future while helping out many others... I kept quiet about this goal for a long time.

Anyways, eventually my mom and dad came to terms for a bit, but as drug addicts go, the cycle of domestic violence and abuse continue.

At this point in time during my grade 8, my parents and I began living in this tight spaced apartment building on the second floor of my mom's clinic space which she rented. Both my parents are irresponsible with my mom and dad making a mess and them screaming at me to clean it up while blaming me for the mess they make. (they sometimes break and dispose the things i own up so that they can have more space for their things).

Their fighting about the same repeated topic occurs over and over again, and this time my dad became extremely invasive to the point he put restriction codes on both me and my mom's device while consistently checking both our e-mails just to find no more evidence since my mom didnt continued what her sister tempted her to do years ago. He has went absolute bonkers to buying a sim card to forge fake evidences of fake conversations just to force my mom to admit to something, and accuse her of being a foreign porn actress that my dad's friends said she looked similar to. He then consistently accused me of being her accomplice and called both of us devils.

Me and my mom frequently gets beaten up, wounded and traumatized on a daily basis where even my mom would blame me for minor faults she's done like accidentally cause a crack on the cabinet which would cause my dad to break my things and beat me with it.

His drug tendencies however ended when my pent up frustrations towards him just bursted.  
It was the start of the Du30 regime at this point in time of my recollections, my dad was under the influence of drugs and consistently abused me and my mom. So I hatched a plan to get him into trouble which would force his permissive family to send him to a proper rehabilitation facility. When they fought, I'd call the police, and go down to protect my mom. Holding a stick as a weapon i tried to fight back at him to let my mom escape, and let myself get beaten up horribly by my dad while causing the most damage to the clinic. I fainted and passed out on the floor with a bunch of broken glass, cuts and bruises at that time but the sacrifice was worth it, since from that point in time, my life was slowly changing. (im not a du30 supporter btw since i condemn the killings but the entire EJK situation worked in my favor somewhat and gave me some slight change)

When the police arrived, some military personnel on leave went around the clinic too since they were nearby the place as well, there they saw wounded me to take to the medical center for medication. and around the same time, they were on a hunt for my dad whom they found and took to custody in their station. My grandma who worried that if she bails out my dad would get shot, decided to opt and request the court for him to get sent to rehab for the next few years.

During that time of peace without my dad, my mom this time became the abuser in a sense. She would degrade me, speak negatively about me on a daily basis, she only makes or prepares food for herself at lunch whereas i wasnt able to eat breakfast or dinner since i go to school. I used to be incredibly underweight and as usual i rely on leftovers back then till i learnt how to cook due to one of my classes at school.

For the longest of time, I guess I felt lonely. I had no one in my immediate family to run to. I have no confidence in myself either to make new friends since i had this fear that they could potentially hurt or bully me too...

&#x200B;

Before I reached 10th grade my dad was released from rehab, he became a different type of person yet retaining some abusive habits. He however this time became more of a religious fanatic.

&#x200B;

He rarely fought with my mom from then on but all their pent up stress and problems. im still their scapegoat. getting gaslit and verbally abused by that, and whenever my dad would get drunk he would hurt me physically by beating me up or doing some absurd ways of punishment to me for minor things that i didnt know i had to do (e.g. clean up my mom's clinic, clean up everything that everyone including the dental staff used, prepare food for the entire dental staff before classes early morning, cleaning the dental clinic bathroom, cleaning their trash around the room, and many more absurd commands)  


I ran away from home multiple times, out of instinct and slept outside at the park or plaza from time to time... I rarely ate during my highschool years too...

During my grade 10-grade 12 years, i joined competitions to avoid staying with my parents or to get distance from them... it felt like bliss... i was never after the medals, i was after the small window of freedom. I did stuff for survival, I handled some part-time jobs to at least earn me a meal, when there's an event, i'd hoard a lot of food to ensure i'd eat the next few days...  


but anyways during my grade 11-12 years it was time to decide on a college, I applied for two universities of which were my dream unis, I passed the exams on both and got scholarship grants on both. however, my dad was very manipulative, he said he needed my help to improve his image again after I ruined it raw, and when i would try to go, I would be prevented and degraded and he would say stuff like: ""hindi ka makakabuhay o makakasurvive diyan!"" ""scholarship?! wag ka na magsingungaling! ang tanga tanga mo nga dito eh hindi mo kaya kaming matulungan ng mama mo!"", he made papers and enrollment forms without my knowledge to be enrolled at his old college as if he's projecting himself to me, but luckily by this time, the pandemic hit, so i ended up choosing a homeschool Oed uni for my course of AB Psychology...  


During my year 1 of OeD college, I met my SO(25f) from a dating site while multitasking with modules.  
My SO is the sole reason i haven't decided to end myself so far, while being able to help me improve my own quality of life. She literally endured a 3-5 hour travel to meet me just to see how im doing while she worries about my health and such and because of her, we more or less forced my parents out of peer pressure that im to live separately from them within the city at least...  
This in turn gave improvement to my mental health but it made me realize that i've developed a response to loud shouting, and so on, and afterwards id receive triggers that would cause me to have traumatic memories play uncontrollably which would make me go into a spiral of mental and emotional breakdowns...  


As of recent despite me living in a separate location from my parents, my dad still tries to control my actions by spreading false rumours to his friends at church about me and he sometimes gaslights and guilt trips my SO that I've strayed away from the path of God or something. The overcontrolling abusive behavior is so bad that when i try to adopt a kitten, he threatens to kill it even though we dont live in the same place just because of his beliefs that cats are evil and will cause me to die.  


At this point i dont even know what to do for the moment... aside to wait and hope for a better future  
Because I need to find a local behavioral therapist for my PTSD and I need to graduate so i can finally be free and live with my SO  


Sorry for long post and if it cannot be understood well enough, as of the moment im typing this, im in a mental breakdown because my dad involved multiple people to downplay my mental disorder... and told me to ""move on"" ""thats the past na!"" without taking accountability or noticing that his current actions are causing this breakdown....",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/yxqe8q/just_a_bottled_up_vent_with_frustrations_and_such/,t2_ygujg5h,2022-11-17 21:33:28,1,3
I have PTSD and depression and graduated cum laude," \[TW: Sexual harassment/rape, suicide\]

I am diagnosed with PTSD and Persistent Depressive Disorder.

I find it difficult to start since most people would be surprised when I tell them this. How did I, the loud, jolly, and smiling classmate, had these diagnoses? I had everything I needed: I grew up with my family, lived a comfortable life, studied in a prestigious school, and achieved high marks. All I had to do was go to school and study, right?

When I was in elementary, I experienced sexual harassment which caused my trauma. The details will not be shared for my privacy, but people often think that after a traumatic experience, everything becomes okay again, right? For the abuser, it was just an ordinary day. For other people, it is just a small sin that can be easily forgotten (“forgive and forget”). But for the victim, we would always remember. Our body holds their sins and it weighs us down.

My childhood flew by and before I knew it, I was in high school. I was aware of my past, and it did hurt, but I tried my best to move on. That’s what everybody says, right? Just move on.

But what people don’t know is how we experience our trauma and grief. They don’t know the times we asked ourselves what we did wrong - what did I, a five-year-old at that time, do? People don’t understand how much we blame ourselves and how difficult it is to speak up and how to forget everything because everything is overwhelming everything keeps moving so fast fast fast and we have to smile we can’t speak about it people don’t believe us we have to be okay we have to move on we have to move move move. 

And so, I tried. I went to school everyday, did my homework diligently, and remained a loving daughter. I took care of my physical health by minding my nutrition, working out, and even doing yoga. On the outside, really, everyone could see how I had an easy life.

I hope you never get to experience 10:00PM in your room feeling afraid, feeling the closing of your throat, feeling dizzy and afraid and nervous and scared because you know you’re safe in your house but you don’t feel because you feel hand hands hands touching you. You feel and see and remember the event happening again and again he’s here he’s touching you and I can’t do anything I scrub my body and wash my body but I still feel his hands imprinted on me. So I cry in silence and hope the pain will go away, and yet it never does. Praying didn’t make it go away. Smiling didn’t make it go away. Studying didn’t make it go away. 

It was particularly difficult during the pandemic because I spent my days in our house, seeing the same four walls for two years. The nightmares got worse and repeated again and again the fear remained and sometimes would leave but would come right back. I don’t understand why does it hurt why does it hurt WHY DOES IT STILL HURT I AM 21 YEARS OLD AND IT HAPPENED WHEN I WAS 5 WHY DOES IT MATTER I didn’t understand I was so lost, afraid, week, and sad. I still see it I still feel it I feel so afraid, so small, so sad. Why am I not happy why does it still hurt why am I like this? During panic attacks my hands were numb, my brain heavy and dizzy, I was smiling and laughing with other people but my chest hurt, my chest feels heavy, my hands are shaking, I feel my heart palpitate but I smile and I nod. Ultimately, the pain was too much to bear. The flashbacks and fear were so intense that I wanted to overdose and just sleep so I won’t feel it again. When I was in my third year, just before laboratory and clinicals, I was hospitalized because of a suicide attempt of overdosing my dormmate's sleeping pills

I asked for help. It was the first time my parents and brother knew what I was going through. It felt new telling other people my experience. It was my first time when I didn’t need to hide the nightmares, the flashbacks, and panic attacks. I remember how difficult it was for me to see my family cry, especially to see how Mama sobbed and wished she could carry my pain. It was also difficult to get used to the side effects of the medications. It took months of medications and therapy to process my trauma. 

Don't get me wrong: I still have flashbacks. I still cry. I am still on medications and therapy. But I also graduated as a cum laude. I had a scholarship for the review center I was looking at. I am preparing for boards. And I am actually in love with living. Sure, there are times when I feel heavy and depressed, but there are also brighter days - lighter days when I can really smile.

I hope that our generation will know that mental health is important, and people with mental illnesses can achieve their dreams. I want people to know that I am depressed and I made it. I had a serious mental illness and I graduated as a cum laude. To you, who are reading this, who doubt yourself, and who have experienced these as well, it is still possible to dream. Yes, you are depressed, you are a victim, but you are so much more than that.

Mental health is a serious issue. I encourage everyone to support their family members and friends who are going through a rough time.

If you are looking for a sign, this is your sign. You matter. You deserve to be in this world. Seek help, especially professional help to process the things that bring you down. It is okay to feel pain. It is okay to feel sad. You are still worthy. Time will tell how amazing you will be.

You deserve to be alive. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/15pu2qb/i_have_ptsd_and_depression_and_graduated_cum_laude/,t2_3srzd7vc,2023-08-13 17:06:45,31,1
Was I really raped? [Trigger Warning] [Story],"I've been asking myself this so many times. Every day, this question is repeated in my head.  


Three months had already passed when I broke up with my ex. In that breakup, I felt like I was mentally kidnapped. I was breaking up with her, inside her car, when she tried to commit suicide in front of me. She got so hysterical and exclaimed that she wanted to commit suicide. She reached on the gear and put it to Drive.  Fortunately, I was fast enough to shift it back to Park before she kicked on the gas. I could hear the engine pagka-apak nya. Nagwawala na sya and  gustong bumaba but I stopped her. Sinasampal nya ko but still hinawakan  ko pa rin sya at pinipigilan. Nagpapanic na rin ako, nagbubusina na ko  para maka-agaw atensyon. I took my phone out with my other hand and  tinawagan ang friend ko. Nung nakita nyang calling na ko sa phone, tyaka  sya tumigil. Pinapakalma ko sya at pinapakalma ko rin sarili ko.   


Nang  kumalma na kami, I suggested na magpalipas muna ng gabi at kumalma muna.  Gusto nya sa bahay namin magpalipas ng gabi pero di ako pumapayag, ayaw  ko at may mga bata sa bahay. Baka magwala na naman sya or kung anong  gawin. Pinipilit nyang sa hotel na lang. Wala akong magawa. I was  helpless. I was threatened sa suicide attempt na un. I have no choice  but sumama.  


Habang nasa hotel, she was again pleading na wag  ituloy ang break up. Gumagawa sya ng conditions, she's trying to  manipulate me again. She is too pushy and controlling. Kapag di ako  pumapayag sa conditions, magwawala sya. Then icocomfort ko sya,  hihinahon sya, then maya maya magplead ulit then maghyhysterical muli.  Paulit-ulit, hirap na hirap ako sa sitwasyon ko. One time pumasok sya  sa CR, then later on bumubulong. Nung nilapitan ko, she was saying  ""Maybe, we should die together. We should die. We should die."". I  comforted her again.  I felt so trapped on that situation. I couldn't just  leave her. I was so empath that I was abused so much.   


One  time nung napakalma ko sya, she kissed me but I'm not kissing her back.  Alam ko na ang kiss na un ay nag-aaya sya. But no, di ako tumutugon. I  said it to her. I said that it was not right. I was persuading her, to  stop. I told her that I don't love her anymore but the only reply I got ay, ""wag  ka na maingay, sinisira mo mood ko"". I was lying, and she was on top of me. She's undressing me. I  was not moving. I kept on saying na hindi ito tama. She continued and told me to shut up. Sinabihan nya akong i-undress ko sya, but no, di ko sya  hinahawakan. She continued. Di ko na alam. Gulong gulo ako. I just wanted  everything to end. It only stopped nung nagcha-change position and  everytime magpapalit ng position, I kept persuading her, ""sigurado ka ba, hindi ito tama."". I want to explode while typing this. Everything was  so wrong. I was wrong. My questions were wrong. My actions were wrong. I  should have stopped it. I should have just stop... I still blame myself  why it happened. Tang ina ko. Every time I lie in bed, I can still see her. I can still feel that helplessness, ung di ako makagalaw. I sleep on the side na lang para makatulog.  


It did not only happen once. The  next morning, she continued pleading. Gumagawa na naman sya ng bagong  conditions. Ayaw makipag-break at gusto nya pa mag-stay ng another night  or two sa hotel pero di ako pumapayag. Gusto ko ng umalis. Ayaw ko na  sya makasama pero ilang pagwawala at pagcocomfort na naman. Kapag kumakalma  sya, nag-aaya ulit sya ng sex. Twice nangyari ulit (tang ina ko talaga),  but before it started, alam nyang ayaw ko. Sasabihan nya agad akong, ""wag  ka maingay, sinisira mo mood ko."" I don't know. Nag-give in na lang  ako. Baka magwala na naman sya, worse mag-attempt na naman ng suicide.  


Marami  pang nangyari afterwards, pumunta sa Trinoma for last lunch. Nagwala  ulit at nag-eskandalo. Naghabulan sa mall, sa parking, hinarang ang car, mataas daw ang parking, gusto tumalon.  


Was  it really rape? At first di sya nag-sink in sakin. Para akong  nababaliw, kinakausap ko sarili ko. Sa isip ko, there are 2 sides na  nagsasagutan, rape vs not. Maybe it was just a breakup sex and not rape. But I did  not fully give my consent e. I only gave in dahil baka magwala na naman  sya. Recently, I opened this up to one of my friends, but the first question I got was ""Tinigasan ka ba?"" Napahinto ako..., next question ""Ni-restrained ka ba?"". Tang ina ko. Baka nagdradrama lang ako. Baka ginusto ko naman talaga. Tinigasan ako e at natuloy un. Di naman ako physically ni-restrained. Naiinis ako sa sarili ko, disgusted sa sarili, sana di ako tinigasan. Pero di naman ako nag-ejaculate nung una. But there were second and third time, bakit di ko pinigilan. Ang tanga ko. Kung na-rape ako, wala rin mawawala sakin. Gulong gulo isip ko. Ang sakit na ng ulo ko. Nagme-mental breakdown na naman ako. Tang ina ko talaga, gusto ko na naman mag-self harm but I promised myself not to, fck. Looking forward sa Friday para makausap ko Therapist ko. Sht, may presentation pa pala ako mamaya. Di ako makapag-focus.

Does anyone else feel like they were just a mistake their whole life? I feel like I wasn’t meant to be here which is why I am not able to attain a normal life like everyone else and have to suffer instead.,"Background: My mom is my dad's 3rd partner. He had a first wife and had a mistress on the side long ago. He had 2 daughters with his first wife and 2 sons with his mistress. I am the 5th child and my sister are his children with his 3rd partner. Thus, my mom and dad were not married.

Growing up, I had to use my mom's surname as the law in my country did not allow for bastards to carry the dad's surname. It was only when I was about to finish high school that my parent's were able to change my surname to follow my dad officially as the law was amended then.

As our country is predominantly Catholic and I attended Catholic school all throughout my pre-university days, I always felt ashamed whenever I have to fill up a form with my surname and such as it was like a label telling everybody that I was a bastard.

Fast forwarding to now, I am 30 years old. I would say that my life has been hard and I find happiness to be something that is out-of-my reach. Things that come along naturally to other people's lives seem impossible for me to reach.

First of all, I went to work overseas on 2014 and I ended up falling in love with a Muslim in 2016. I did not want to convert even though his family kept forcing me to as I felt that it is an even graver sin to convert for the sake of his family's image. It came to a point where his family became aggressive with me and even said that our relationship is a sin and we are dragging his innocent family down to hell with us. They even threatened my job and my life so we had to resort to make it a legal matter by sending them a Cease and Desist letter. It was such a tumultuous time for me and though I have cut all contact with them, it still drags me down from time-to-time.

As my SO's family put so much pressure on him and kept verbally abusing him at home, he also suffered. It was then one of the factors as why it lead him to cheat on me in the 4th year of our relationship. It wasn't anything physical. Basically, he sought comfort from this girl (who knew he was attached) and ended up catching feelings for her. He then left me for her and it crushed me as not only was I hurt but it was also unexpected as I never thought he was capable of it. It ruined all my trust on him and how I saw him as a person. Long story short, he only ended chatting with her for a few more days after leaving me and then they met up in person for the first time. But on that same night, he texted me and asked me if I could forgive him. He then cut all ties with her and went back to me.

Anyways, fast forward to 2022, we ended up getting married. But due to the difference in religion, we only ended up having a civil solemnization. It was only done through zoom and we only asked 1 of his friend and my best friend as witnesses as required by the law. My family and friends are actually supportive but I just felt ashamed I guess that I didn't even tell anyone that we were getting married. I only told my mom like a week before and told her that it will just be signing a document via zoom so she does not need to attend. Thus I did not get the romantic wedding as the other people in my family or friends. My SO did not even propose to me and I even had to buy my own wedding ring as my SO was broke.

Even securing housing is an issue. As I am a foreigner, my husband is still considered as a ""single local"" and we are not able to get priority for public housing and will have to wait until my husband turns 35 to be able to join the ballot. Buying a 'resale' flat is out of reach as well as it is now too expensive. So we are only renting a room which is fine if not for the increase in rental in this country. I have a feeling that I would eventually be priced out of this country and have no choice but to go home to my home country eventually.

Due to the housing issue and our unstable relationship, it is really impossible right now for us to have a child. I feel that it would be unfair for the child and I feel like I would be infecting it with my miserable life. Accepting this reality is a huge blow for me as I have always dreamed of having kids since I turned 18.

I've already given up on any hopes, dreams, and ambitions now but not being able to have kids just makes me lose all meaning for my life. Perhaps it is because I have been ""indoctrinated"" since young that a normal life must follow the same path as other people i.e. get married-get a house & car-have a kid. My career is also getting nowhere. I also do not have meaningful relationships. I am not just living day-by-day like an empty shell and waiting desperately to just die.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/ypirb6/does_anyone_else_feel_like_they_were_just_a/,t2_qarsm52n,2022-11-08 19:01:39,0,2
Am I being abused and gaslit? What counts as abuse?,"Hello! I will go directly to the point. I am writing this because for the first time in a couple of years, my father hit me after we argued. Specifically he punched me in the head and face multiple times (he managed to punch me in the eye). My mother also slapped me multiple times after. My parents always go for the head or face. I am 21, and though this has been the first time it happened in a while (mostly because of physical distance), it is something that used to regularly happen to me since I was 12.

I've been grappling with depression and mental health issues from a young age and kept it to myself because my family had very vocally negative views on mental illness. This made me a very irritable and volatile child. To be clear though, it only manifested in me being angry all the time and quick to talk back at home, however I was well behaved, active and got good grades in school. I was never the type to act out physically, only with words. That has always been the main reason cited for me being hit. I acknowledge that I am someone who is very blunt with a very sharp tongue, even from a young age.

My father worked abroad for most of my life but whenever he came home we would fight and it would usually end in me being backhanded or punched and us not talking for months when he left a few days later. My mother and I would fight almost every other day and she was very fond of slapping and pulling hair, and even strangled me once. I have never fought back physically. I come from a family where violence as discipline is seen as the norm and even encouraged, so mostly my grandparents would just say I should be grateful I don't get hurt worse and that I am well provided for. My mother said earlier that it's better that she hurts me physically rather than cursing me out in Filipino, because at least ""hindi niya sinisira pagkatao ko"". Basically, I'm always told I brought this on to myself.

When I was younger, I thought this was normal and happened in every family. I said to myself that it's okay as long as they never left bruises. I feel like I'm the crazy one for resenting this treatment. In the few years since I last got hit, I've just been suppressing the memories and feelings of that time. However, being hit again as an adult, I'm starting to question if I really deserve to be hurt? Is this normal?",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/yotit0/am_i_being_abused_and_gaslit_what_counts_as_abuse/,t2_t2ccdxkk,2022-11-08 01:14:22,1,4
