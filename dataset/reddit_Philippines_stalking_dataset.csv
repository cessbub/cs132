ABS Expecially For You Casually Enabling Stalking,"
Friend shared this to me. Supposedly, guy is a site manager ng BPO(?) and got details of someone he saw in the logbook and pursued her.

Thoughts on Kita Kita romanticizing stalking?,"Haven't watched the movie.
I need honest opinions, as there are circulating threads about Tonyo (Empoy) being creepy and that it romanticizes stalking. Your thoughts on that?

Some of the things I do wonder...
- who defines if it is creepy or kilig? The one that is ""stalked"" (Alessandra) or the viewers? 
- didn't other movies or tv shows had their leading men and ladies doing the ""stalking"" stuff? I think there's also a Kdrama that did that but I cannot recall.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/6se91v/thoughts_on_kita_kita_romanticizing_stalking/,t2_yy3f2,2017-08-08 23:33:19,22

My BF stalked his Ex. Helppp.,"for girls, would you make a big deal out of it?
for guys, have you ever stalked your ex while in a relationship?

a lil background:

- we've been together 3yrs.
- they were on-off 5 years. cause of breakup: ex gf cheated multiple times
- i check my BFs phone once in a while. never saw his ex's name in search history until a while ago.

probable reason why he did this:
- heard him empathizing with his friend who has lovelife issuws that he also experienced being hurt before.

any thoughts?? :(",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/krkka3/my_bf_stalked_his_ex_helppp/,t2_84x3a7c0,2021-01-06 17:26:44,0
Beware of customer data being abused from FoodPanda drivers.,"Since FoodPanda drivers have access to your number to call or text you when they arrive, beware that they can actually take advantage of that and stalk you on social media. The screenshot was taken from Telegram, where I strictly only use for my review center’s gc. I replied because I thought it was one of the staff from my review center because they are the only ones who knows of my account in Telegram. Low and behold this bizarre text I received from a rider that delivered my food earlier that afternoon. 

FoodPanda should really look into this and find a solution to avoid this from happening, this is SCARY. Not only do they know now where you live, your number, but as well as your name too. My suggestion is that they should keep the interaction between customers and riders within the app to avoid them gaining access to your data and using it to stalk you.

for more context: I continued to explain that he had the wrong number and replied that it wasn’t because he was the rider that delivered my food earlier. He proceeded to ask if we can chat and whether or not I have a husband or a boyfriend already. I blocked him after that.",https://i.redd.it/hkrqig24fxlb1.jpg,t2_h5x4shhsh,2023-09-03 07:25:22,1116

My Wife's Filipino ex BF won't leave us alone?,"Hello, I'm an American married to a Filipino National. We are blessed to meet eachother and be married. I'm currently in the USA and she is in Bacolod.

The problem is, he won't stop stalking us. He is jealous and is threatening to ""hurt"" me if I visit Bacolod. 

We want to raise our future kids in the Philippines so they can be dual citizens, and I want them to grow up with the Filipino culture rather than American culture.

We really want to raise them in Bacolod as it is close to her family. Her ex is really good at finding out her social media (my wife blocks him all the time and even made new accounts yet he still finds out somehow) and at finding information about us.

I personally feel unsafe for both our safety. Philippines is not like the USA where I can call the cops at will and then put like a restraining order or even an investigation.

Other than moving to another city in the Philippines, what can I do to ensure my future family's safety from him? This man is hellbent on ruining our relationship...

Blocking him from social media and making new alternative account deters him for some time but he still somehow finds out.

I'm worried if we decide to buy a house in Bacolod together, then somehow he finds our home address--that puts our safety in jeopardy...

Any tips?

"""Pwede namang magtipid"" and other shits I've read on freelancing groups earlier this morning to justify that $1 = 57php is worth celebrating for","Sorry na kung umagang-umaga, nagmumura ako, pero tang ina. Bakit ba ang daming Pinoy freelancer na ang bobo? I saw this thread earlier on an Upwork group which celebrates this exchange, and a bunch of shitheads in the comment section were actually celebrating it? Inaaway pa ang mga nagsasabing hindi ito maganda?

&#x200B;

# Context A:

The commenter pointed out that there's a massive inflation, so it's pointless.

Reply sa kanya?

>Pwede naman kayong magtipid kung namamahalan.

First of all, tanga ka ba? So kung kailangan mo palang magtipid kahit mataas ang palitan, anong dapat ipag-celebrate?

&#x200B;

# Context B:

Some certain Apolo10 said na ang toxic daw ng mga nagagalit at sinasabihang insensitive yung OP. Quoting her:

>Bakit hindi nyo idonate ang kita nyo tutal pare-pareho namang dolyar ang kita nyo?  
>  
>May masabi lang talaga kay BBM. Di talaga kayo makamove on?

Ang haba ng sinabi ni Tanga, wala namang point. Also, I stalked her profile. Nasa US pala si Gaga at mukhang nakasungkit ng afam. E kung umuwi kaya siya dito?

&#x200B;

# Context C:

Tanga. Everything is political, including ForEx. Saka bat ba G na G kayo e sinasabi lang na di worth celebrating for ang mataas na palitan?

Financial Illiteracy in the Philippines,"So my friend booked an escort service kasi may event sa company and gusto mya magdala ng partner na maiinggit yung mga ibang marketing executives sa company. As usual, yung escort service napunta sa pokpokan. Maliit lang singil ni Escort Girl (2,500 all-in) kaya sige naman si mokong kung barkada kasi sobrang ganda nga.

Then naulit ng multiple times in 2 a spand of 5 days. Until nagsawa na yung kaibigan ko. Then nakakareceived daw sya ng message from the girl nakikiusap na ibook ulit kasi wala syang pangkain. So nagtanong sya san napunta yung lampas 10k+ na kinita nya in a week. Sabi ni girl marami sya gastusin.

Similarly, may kilala akong mag-asawa sa province namin, everytime na makakaextra yung dalawa sa mga sideline nila, akala mo hindi naghihirap. And marami pang situation na ganito akong na-o-obrseve. Why do some poor Pinoy and Pinoy families act like this.

I think Simple Financial Literacy dapat tinuturo as early as grade 1. As in may dedicated subject para dito. Hindi yung sasabihan lang ng bata na magandang ugaliin na magtipid.

P.S. I;m sure may chance na mauwi to sa usapang gobyerno so according to my friend Pink si Girl based on their random after sex convos and yung mag-asawa na man na nabanggit ko are Apologists.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/zc0ebe/financial_illiteracy_in_the_philippines/,t2_6bmvh26,2022-12-04 12:29:17,6
Imee’s Californian Mango,"You want a genuine hot take?

Posts insulting Imee Marcos’ chin protrusion (mangga memes, etc) is also a form of body shaming.

I am not defending Imee Marcos, I am simply using her as a way to demonstrate and challenge the hypocrisy within this group.

Now before you label me as a closeted Apolo10, (that’s what people do when they do not have a valid rebuttal) you can stalk my Reddit acct for proof of my support for Leni. 

If you are justifying this habit by saying that Imee is a bad person blah blah blah, then I would be on board with that- if only Imee was the only one on Earth who possesses this attribute, but no, there are other Leni supporters/filipino liberals who also display this attribute.

I am also guilty of making fun of Imee’s mango in the past (it’s fun) and to be honest, I will continue to make fun of her protruding mango. Again, the purpose of this comment is not to virtue signal, but to challenge the hypocrisy of this group and keep the members off of their high horse.

Body shaming includes ALL types of insults that make fun of a feature/lack of a feature apart from the established cultural norm, not just about weight.

Or is it, that only something is offensive when it doesn’t further a group’s agenda?

P.S. censored/silenced on fb so dito ko na ipopost

Edit: 10 mins in and i already know that this post won’t get much traction or even censored because it is a legitimately hot take/unpopular opinion. Only posts which are subservient to the popular ideology are the only ones who get nourished with upvotes. 

I just want to say that just because you ignore something, that doesn’t make that “something” less true.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/yaqcns/imees_californian_mango/,t2_74hbkly7,2022-10-22 23:15:56,0
delimma,"Pldt wifi (series)

We live in a place where the neighbor has the only post for a pldt wifi slot around the area. So we connected with their wifi connection through a TP-Link modem they recommended as a local business (for us also to have a connection, and we pay up to 1200 per month directly thru them. 

But our concern is that all throughout the month of August almost 10 days no wifi connection. Because the   neighbor's son is a mentally illed dude, and made a bad impression on the process of us connecting directly throught their system. Wanting to be friends, as a female, it is threat knowing that we are not from the area we just rented. Knowing he who studies IT in college, and it concerns us that all the peso WiFi's around the area has a connection, except us.

(Side story)

He was TOO friendly on the first day we we're settling the wifi to get connected. Too close even an inch when talking or opening up conversation that went to personal questions. Me and my partner got weirded out since again, we are not from the area we newly just moved into. 2 days after he knocked on our door, asking for a charger for his friend, we let him borrow out of respect. But never again we tried to interact and ignored him if we go out to a local area store near our apartment. We feel disturbed and cautious as female tenant's that neighbors could just barge in and out in the apartment area. 

Last interaction after a few weeks, it was a blackout and me and my partner thought we could hang out the lobby near the gate of our room with a camping chair, and he came to us outside the gate, insisting for us to join for a drink but we declined since it's getting fishy of him to do so.

---- we asked our apartment neighbor in the next room about the wifi connection and also if there's something unusual about the dude we we're suspecting of messing around. Then she said yes, he did too stalk her, disturbed and knocked in her room and got too personal. (At the time that her boyfriend wasn't around)
She and her sister won't bother going out. And always locking their doors.

 *One time her sister got to sleep with a knife and scissor beside them for precautions. Because of how he stalked them way before we moved in the apartment area.


It's so unfair to pay monthly for an ugly wifi connection throughout the whole month, we can't even act about since they don't give a damn if we speak of our concern, and just say lots of alibi's that are unacceptable knowing there's no bad weather or caution about the connection of Pldt itself. Plus having a stalker neighbor who is the son of the Local wifi business, that they so call. Bothered by the son who they can't even discipline.

With no phone service at all. Impossible to contact friends and family without the wifi connection. Incase of emergencies.

We only rely working online for a living.

They have the main control of the wifi in our apartment. 
What to do? Knowing we have been fooled by fools.

Having a bad feeling about it. It's pretty unusual.
We have no choice but to continue to connect with them as main wifi, since we already inquired at the pldt office for an own account for the pldt line. But there are  no extra slots available.

Maybe someone can suggest or share an opinion. Since this is the only app that I can rant and share a situation online.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/15uhujt/delimma/,t2_grrghnuq6,2023-08-18 19:25:04,0

Maria Ressa and Lin Chen,"Maria Ressa  and Lin Chen 

Nancy Ng


Maria Ressa, former CNN reporter and Nobel Laureate; Lin Chen, scholar in computational finance. They are both US-educated American citizens, one at Princeton and the other at Harvard. One was born in the Philippines and the other in China.

Over the years, they have both been, respectively,trying to expose the lies spread by the Philippine government and by media backed by the Chinese government.

But the ways their governments dealt with them made a lot of difference to their fates.

The Philippine government dealt with Maria Nessw by legal tools, or at least in the name of justice, by filling civic suits that threatene to bankrupt her and issuing warrants to arrest her. All the tactics, justifiable or not, were under the sun and transparent.

The China Communist Youth League no longer attacks Lin Chen in any transparent way. In stead, the League deployed an army of bots, cyberpolice, and overseas agents online to vilify and undermine Dr. Chen, spreading misinformation and disinformation, deleting posts that tell the alternative side of the story, and harassing and stalking him offline, and most recently, executing an assassination, although it failed.

Why has the Chinese Youth League changed its tactic? I think it's because the time has changed. 21 years ago, there were no social media, self-media, blogs, or Weibo, etc. Dr. Chen had no means to openly reply to the China Youth Daily's allegations. Today's Chinese Communist youth league is smart enough to avoid openly fabricating ""evidence"", as they know that in doing so, they may run the risk of getting exposed as lies right after they are published.

Being persecuted differently,  one won the Nobel Prize, and the other is still risking his life to get his message out.

A prominent Chinese physicist once said, It is misfortune to be born a Chinese. Yes, the physicist got the point.

I just found out my 15-year old cousin(F) has been dating a 29-year old(M) for a year now.. What do I do?,"I am honestly extremely disgusted by this. She's obviously being groomed. 


I've tried talking to her mother and my mother about this but they don't see any problems about it. They even laughed and said ""As long as they wear condoms, it's fine. And if she gets pregnant, he's rich so she can live happily anyways.""


I looked at them with disgust on my face and immediately left.


I did some Facebook stalking on her ""boyfriend""'s profile and it seems that his family doesn't care either. I tried talking to my cousin but she doesn't see my point either since, in her words, ""Age is just a number.""


I am honestly very conflicted. As it seems everyone but me is fine with this. She hasn't even graduated Junior High, for heck's sake!


 I'm not even sure the police would care either since the age of consent here is 12 years old. And I don't have any proof either. No doubt they'll just deny their relationship when questioned by authorities.


What should I do, r/Philippines? Do I just mind my own business? Or do I do something? If the latter, what do I do then? I'm honestly so confused.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/kx9ylc/i_just_found_out_my_15year_old_cousinf_has_been/,t2_s5u4u,2021-01-15 01:14:52,41
"/r/Philippines, let's talk about this new website connected to the Comelec data leak (you know what it is)","Dear /r/Philippines,

I'm sure you know by now that there's a website that allows you to search names on the [Comelec data that was leaked not long ago](http://www.interaksyon.com/infotech/sensitive-comelec-data-now-in-the-open-%E2%80%94-trend-micro). Pretty much by now, the people informed about this leak know what's in the data leak: names, addresses, biometric data, and other vital information the fucking Comelec just shrugged off at the beginning. 

I'm also sure some of you are also trying to post a link on the sub but got shot down immediately; it was our discretion to do so. **Please do not make a post about the link; we're gonna delete it, anyway.** Why? We do not want any untoward incident to arise by posting it here. Besides, this *may* lead to doxxing, much to our dismay (geddit, this may, dismay, no, no, okay).

While the word is now out there about this website, here are some things to think about:

1. What do you feel about this? On a scale of 1 to the [Angry German Kid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8SWMAQYQf0) how angry were you when you found out about this?

2. How is this going to affect us? What are the repercussions that the massive data leak has become friendlier to ~~stalkers~~ users?

3. Want better security of your data? Now is the perfect time to do it! Call Comelec. Call your government agencies. Call Bam Aquino (I think he's one of the more tech-savvy senators, given his inovolvement with e-sports and internet connection). Call the president. Better yet, **vote this election season and demand it from the next president**. If voting isn't your style, then I guess, go back to the first ones.

4. If you feel like your circles are not aware about the issue, tell them about this **but don't give them the link**. It might change your mind. Use the website to raise awareness, not as a tool for stalking and other repulsive shit.

Now that the cat is out of the bag, let's talk about it.

**Edit:**

A lot of people are giving this advice: **DO NOT SEARCH YOUR NAME ON THE DATABASE!** It sounds tempting but we do not know what they do with the search queries done on the website. Exercise due diligence, people. And stay smart.

**Edit 2:**

What can you do instead to make this stop? from one of the comments below, you can do your part by doing the reporting the website to the following:

* [CloudFlare abuse report form](https://www.cloudflare.com/abuse/form)

* [GoDaddy violation report](https://supportcenter.godaddy.com/abusereport)

* [Google AdSense violation report (apparently, the site is making money out of it)](https://support.google.com/adsense/contact/violation_report)

* [Google phishing report form](https://www.google.com/safebrowsing/report_phish/?hl=en)

**Edit 3:**

I got a few messages asking for the link. **To those who know don't bother giving it anymore. Let's keep it to ourselves to prevent further sharing and abuse. To those who don't know and have a noble intention of reporting it, it's alright if you won't see the site. Consider yourself lucky.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/4fs1oa/rphilippines_lets_talk_about_this_new_website/,t2_l4dqd,2016-04-21 16:19:20,152

I kinda miss ph schools,"Hi r/Philippines!!

Been stalking this subreddit for a while and never wrote a post...

btw back to the topic. I've been living in Italy for at least 11 years for now... I graduated college and have a bachelor's degree. I've been working for 10 months in a software development team.

Lately i've been browsing some topics like politics etc. I've been also hit by this nostalgia from ph schools (i studied in the Ph from kindergarten to third year hs, old School system). I've spent 9 and 1/2 years of my life studying abroad and I found it really ""boring"" because they don't have extracurricular activities. Most homeworks are overload, no cerimonial excercises (aka graduation day), JS prom, no anything. Our concept of school is only reading book, go home, do homework NADA.. I know that most schools in the Ph are glorified but schools here are really TRASH. Vacations are longer here but at least vacations in the Ph are homework-free and you can really feel no work to do during the vacations. 

Maybe I'm just nostalgic because I missed a lot of things there (usually college love life)....

I think I'm losing my best friend over politics,"It was subtle at first but I think it's now pretty obvious. She slowly stopped communicating with me, I never knew what was going on in her life anymore, and whenever I try to reach out, she tends to end our convo short.

She's a niece of a known corrupt local politician (who is aligned strongly with BBM). I have never shied away from being vocal and critical against the gov't and against the apologists on my posts especially.

It seems this has affected her solely but she never mentioned it. She practically ghosted me. Now that the elections are over, I started seeing her ""haha"" reacts on my statuses. Even the past ones (posted days or weeks back) that show my dismay towards the gov't and BBM which means she started stalking my wall.

I don't mind losing her over my principles but it still stings like a bitch that she chose to let go of our almost 2 decades of friendship. 🥺

🌈🌈🌈TL;DR: my best friend of almost 20 years is slowly ghosting me over politics (I know it's politics cause she's back after the election results giving ""haha"" reacts to my statuses).

EDIT: OMG! The support from this community. 😭😭😭 I was afraid I'd be called out for being the bad guy. 

Also, I have a solid group of friends (college buds) who are against the apologists and the Marcoses so I'm good, y'all. Plus, this sub works well for my mental health. 😊💟😊💟

On a seller's point of view, I think it would attract more attention in terms of comments. It's also a way to hide prices from competitors.

POV: Isang beses mo lang ginawa pero habang buhay ko dala dala,"(a story i got from a TIKTOK comment on that POV)
Birthday ng papa ng bf ko non pinapunta nyako sa kanila, I bought a gift too Casio Watch for his father. Nagpapasundo ako sa kanya non but he refused, sabi nya tutulungan nya raw mama nya mag ayos kaya ako pumunta nalang ako, understanding naman ako kaya bumyahe nako mag isa, from Manila to Imus.

Its 4pm na, plano rin kasi namin non na don ako mag overnight. Pag dating ko ron marami rami na yung tao, nag chat ako na nasa labas nako nahihiya kasi akong pumasok, then ayon lumabas sya sabi nya ""di ko pala nasend message ko, sabi ko wag ka na pumunta"" pinapasok nyako then pinaupo sa sala, pag pasok ko nakita ko agad ex nya nasa kitchen kausap yung mama nya, they look happy. I remain silence then pumunta sa kitchen yung bf ko and kumuha ng food tapos inabot sakin, lumapit sakin papa nya we chitchat then laugh then napansin ko nalang na wala na pala sya sa tabi ko, tinignan ko buong bahay nila, di ko sya mahagilap. Dumating mga tropa nya then one of his friend lumapit sakin hinahanap si bf ko sabi ko baka nasa taas sa kwarto nya, umakyat kami then I saw him at the terrace he was talking to his ex, I saw his smile its genuinely.

He looks happy with her then napatingin sila samin, tinawag ng bf ko si Jayvee then lumapit kaming dalawa sabi ni Jayvee sa ex bat andito ka di naman kayo close ni tito sabay tawa, ang ganda ng ex nya napaka sexy at ang puti. tumabi ako sa bf ko but lumayo sya sabay lumabas sya tapos tinawag ako, pumasok kami sa kwarto nya sinara nya yung pinto then he hugged me and kiss my forehead then he said ""Ayoko na, narealize ko na mahal ko pa pala talaga ex ko akala ko naka move on nako, pero hindi pala masaya lang pala akong kasama ka but everynight pinagsisisihan ko parin na pinakawalan ko sya, still stalked her. Im sorry I tried to love you pero hindi, mahal ko pa talaga sya, sorry ihahatid nalang kita"" natulala nalang ako di ko namalayan na tumutulo na luha ko na, no its ok uuwi ako mag isa.

Lumabas nako ng kwarto andon parin sa terrace yung tropa nya and his ex. nakita akong umiiyak ng tropa nya lumapit sakin, tinanong nya bf/ex ko na anong problema then my bf/ex said ""hatid mo nalang sya pre, bukas na pag usapan walang kasama si *** pag hinatid ko sya, grabe he really cares about his ex talaga. sobrang nanlumo ako non. sana ako nalang sya.

I just deactivated my FB account because a BBM troll is instigating a bullying attack against me.,"So earlier this morning, I woke up receiving a message from a stranger. May sinend syang link sakin -- post ng isang BBM troll who screenshoted my comment dissing Sandro Marcos (my comment is something like, ""Di ko gets bat sila gwapong-gwapo dyan? Ang panget naman kaya"") tapos naka-attach sa old picture ko when I'm still 60lbs heavier, maitim at maraming pimple. NOTE: THAT PICTURE IS TAKEN IN 2018. That troll chose my least flattering picture to make a point.

Now his followers are making fun of me. But know, rather than patulan, I just shrugged it off. Alam ko namang hindi na ganda ang itsura ko. Makinis na ako ngayon, and I'm way slimmer than before.

However, it didn't stop there. Hours later, may nagbomba ng HAHA react sa profile pictures at public posts ko. When I checked it was, it's another dummy account na merong pictures ko, and most are unflattering angles. Yung iba, screenshots from my Tiktok. Alam n'yo yung sinadya talaga niyang i-screenshot yung magmumukha akong panget?

It was messy, and it's kinda triggered my anxiety. Some of those pictures na hindi screenshots, I don't even remember posting it but somehow that account got a copy. \[While writing this, I realized it could be one of my ""friends"". I live in a place kung saan napakaraming BBM supporters, and I'm pretty vocal about my support of Leni and my distrust of BBM.\]

Anyway, thankfully, my game buddies came to rescue me. We mass reported it, and around 2 pm, the account is either deactivated or taken down \[prolly the former\].

But anyway, this attack triggered my paranoia because it feels like I'm being stalked online. I know, papansin lang yung troll na iyon. I can tell that the reason why I Haha-bombed me is to call my attention dahil ilang araw na niyang pinagpipiyestahan yung pictures ko, but it was enough to get me shaken.

Reminder: Doxxing is not permitted not just on r/ph (see Rule6) but also on Reddit,"Like what the title says, but I'll put it as a separate post just to make the point clear. (Also, I'm writing this *motu proprio,* I didn't wait for other mods to do this.)

I know that a certain individual abroad is in hot water right now, apparently for stalking a public personality. And as alleged by online posts and comments are to be believed, the person is also an alleged illegal immigrant (daw).

Whether the said person is a stalker and/or an illegal immigrant is not for me to say, I have no personal knowledge of his circumstances. Let us just leave it to the proper authorities and report the person and let them deal with it.

**However...this does** ***not*** **give anyone the license to post that person's personal details online. Not just on this sub, but on Reddit itself.**

Reddit has had brushes with doxxing and in some circumstances it did cause serious harm on individuals. (Case in point: a person was incorrectly identified as the suspect in the Boston Marathon bombing and [this led to his suicide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_of_Sunil_Tripathi)). For understandable reasons, doxxing will never be tolerated anywhere, and all mods are exhorted by Reddit admins to be vigilant on this.

*(edit)* Not to mention: such unauthorized disclosure will likely be considered a violation of our [Data Privacy Act](https://www.privacy.gov.ph/data-privacy-act/). Violating the DPA has stiff penalties, in case you were wondering....

So, just to re-emphasize the point: **doxxing is not allowed on** r/philippines **under any circumstance. Any post that contains the personal and contact details of another person without their consent shall be removed without warning.**

**If you see any incident of doxxing (posting of another person's contact details without their permission)  on** r/ph**, report it to us mods right away or tag us in a follow-up comment so we can take the appropriate action.**

*(edit 2)* And in case you were wondering...I temp-banned the account/s that was/were involved in this incident. No appeals will be entertained, not even on modmail. We *~~want~~* need to be strict on this.

Child custody on the basis of a possibly unfit parent.,"Seeking help.
(1) Who gets child custody between unmarried and split parents of children above the age of 6 years old? 
(2) What constitutes an unfit parent?

Anyone know where to find the legal basis?

TLDR: The father is the only one working and supporting the children. He experiences emotional abuse from the mother. The mother is unemployed, and constantly threatens and blackmails the father to take away the children if they don’t get back together.

Full situation: 
Father is the only one working and supporting the children. Mother is employed and has no plans to work. 

Father and mother has been in an on and off again relationship for around a decade years. Father continued to stay for the sake of the children, but could not take the emotional and verbal abuse of the mother anymore. The last they called it off, the mother initiated the break up. During the last break up, she specifically uttered to him that she wouldn’t care if he died. She tried to get back together with him, but the father didn’t give in this time. He, however, still supports and care for the children. Mother starts to threaten the father to take away the children if they do not get back together and if he gets together with someone else. When the father was in a relationship, the mother would constantly message his new partner to stay away. When the mother was blocked by the partner, she created another account to continue to stalk and harass her. Mother has had different boyfriends since their break up, and is currently in a relationship with one.

I started to believe that it was my fault why she did it and I became a slave to her doing everything she wants and giving up everything and everone i love so that she wont leave me for someone else. when i finally have the courage to set my self free she instantly made a move of speaking ill against me to my so called ""friends"".

"Senate approves grave penalties for catcalling, street harassment","House of Representatives approves a bill that seeks to penalize catcalling, wolf-whistling, cursing, leering, groping, and persistent requests for name and contact details after clear refusal, public masturbation, and stalking, among others. The punishment ranges from  P10,000 fine or 12-hour community service, with mandatory attendance in a gender sensitivity seminar to 2 years to 4 years and 2 months in prison or P100,000 to P500,000 fine 

No one is above the law. The question here: Is this applicable to people inside the Malacanang?

TheArk Vehicle and Digicars SCAM WARNING!,"My parents got a car through THE ARK VEHICLE Trading Inc. Ever since last month tumigil na sila na maghulog sa amin. 

It all started around August - September. Sa fb page nila sunod sunod ang notice sa pagtanggal nila ng mga agents. Our agent for our account was one of them. We found out this agent started (or atleast part) of the DIGICARS. 

Sobrang hirap nila icontact sa mga numbers and emails they gave out. No response for weeks, however when they finally did. Nagpapafill out lng ng mga information about sa account at iffollow up daw... we did all these thru all the means na available pero wala namang update na dumadating. When I stalked their fb page, nagtatanggal din sila ng mga comments ng mga tao. 

The suspicious thing about this, when we talked sa terminated agent namin na nasa Digicars na. Yung scripted response from the finance department ng TheArk ay yun lang din binibigay samin nung agent na supposed to be nasa Digicars na. I did some digging and found out ganito din yung agents ng iba. Sinasabi na iba na yung company pero same lang ang pinagsasabi.

We suspect na magkakakontsaba padin ang mga ito. They probably started DIGICARS para maka-akit pa ng mga tao para tuloy tuloy padin ang cash flow sa mga nagddown na tao. While itong THEARK will probably announce bankruptcy soon. Wala na talagang habol. Our family all lost hope na magtutuloy pa sila ng hulog.... wala na.

We got our car around 2020, nakapaghulog sila for a little more than a year. We need a few more months sana para makabreak-even man lang sa nadown... Wala na yung dinown namin. We are also forced to shoulder yung interest ng bank till the 5 year contract we availed para di masira name namin sa bank. 

I have a OFW parent. I usually don't involve myself kapag nagdedesisyon sa pera parents ko. I regret na di ako nagresearch man lng ng kaonti about this para maadvise sila against it...I HOPE THIS POST SERVES AS A WARNING sa mga tao na nagiisip na magrelease ng car through them - THEARK & DIGICARS. I also hope na mabrought up sa media itong mga to kasi kawawa yung mga OFW at mga ordinaryong tao kumakayod ng pera para sana may maipundar. 

I know tuloy tuloy padin ang pagrelease nila ng mga sasakyan. Madami pa din naloloko porket nakarelease nga ng sasakyan, pero di ka RISK-FREE until matapos ang paghuhulog.

Idea: online shaming community,"Hello all,

I am planning to start an online shaming community. Before you react with ""Hey, hold on, that's a BAD idea!"", allow me to pitch what this community will be:

- A community to post ""huli ka"" moments, report public incidents, criminal activities, or general annoyances. Think TOP GEAR PH's Facebook page: bustling with daily road rages and annoyances, but with a far broader scope and reach as it would not be limited to traffic-related incidents
- It will be completely anonymous -- members will be given steps to ensure their anonymity. This wins us with some points: 1) the fear of being fingered will be removed from the equation, thus allowing people to post more incidents than they would normally on social network sites like Facebook for example, 2) double-blind deniability would mask all our identities, thereby no single person can be targeted by individuals who might not look keenly on our incident posts, and 3) all conversations  and incident reports will be without prejudice (""eh bata ka pa!"", ""anong alam mo e XXX and relihiyon mo?"", ""eh nagtatrabaho ka pala sa YYY company e!""). I am all too familiar with online prejudice, and this community can do without it.
- Think of an online Citizen's Charter where anyone can report incidents without fear of ""resbak"", and where proper authorities, granted our influence extend to government bodies, can look at less-reported incidents at a glance.

Sounds good? That said, if you're interested in building this community with me, please reach out to me via private message here in reddit. Since this will be a totally free, not-for-profit community, I cannot offer compensation; merely the satisfaction of catching wrongdoers in our society and shedding light to news that might not be as clear before.

I have been actively stalking this sub for many months now, and I am confident to say that with the way of thinking this subreddit collectively has, I came to the right place. If this post is inappropriate for this subreddit however, I surrender to the moderators and please delete as you see fit.

PS: If you are indeed interested in getting in touch with me, I recommend you do so via burner reddit accounts: that is, new accounts with no prior history so as to keep our anonymity.

Thanks! Mabuhay ang sambayanang Pilipinas.

My Father \[M/54\] has a son who is older than me (he has known him for almost three years already) and he did not tell me \[F/22\] and my stepmother \[F/50\] about it.

Yesterday, this certain brother of mine \[M/33\] added me on facebook (we have no mutual friends) and tried to contact me, he told me that he is my older brother. Of course I was skeptical at first and I told him I do not know what he is talking about, but then I stalked him, I saw his pictures, and he really looks like my father. He also has a picture with my father last June 2016 with the caption ""After 30 years of searching... finally"". I confirmed it with my aunt who's the only person who knows about this besides my father and yep, he really is my big brother.

I asked him if he talks to my father or has built a relationship with him and his only reply to me was ""Yeah he knows me, we've met, but it seems like he does not care about it."" and it hit me.

Now, I'm so confused and I don't know what to do, should I tell my father about this? He's been hiding it from us for years. Also, should I tell my stepmother about my brother? Or should I let my father tell it to her? I know she would be hurt but I want her to know the truth. I want to talk to them but now is not the right timing. I want to meet my older brother and let him be part of our family. please help.

"[STORY-TIME/FAN THEORY]Over-analyzing ""HONEY MY LOVE SO SWEET"" By April Boy Regino","WARNING!*This is just fan theory,so if you call me crazy for writing this,it's OK,i saw it coming and I probably deserve it after writing something like this.although all accounts written are true,remember that this is just for fun and must be taken with a pinch of salt,PLEASE DON'T TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY* 




It was a hot summer day in May,the sun blaring down on the windows,the house-help doing chores,while five year old me enjoyed running around,being a kid,messing clothing hangers around.The radio was on,making the aura less mundane,pumping out popular songs of that time.Cheesy radio hit after cheesy radio hit filled the air,none of them piqued my interest.The songs seemed passive to me until one song came that really stood out to my ears,it started with a xylophone like sound that sounded sweet,then the beat followed,then came the rest of the song.I knew right away it was [April Boy Regino](http://images-onemusicph.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/articles/1459495882_April-Boy-Landing.jpg),the vibe,the voice,the feel of the song bellowed April Boy,the five year old me only understood some of the words,but i knew it was a love song(without knowing what love really is yet).As kids will do,the song stayed within my childhood set-list(the songs that a kid will remember and sing to adults for the cute factor)but when the popularity of the song waned,so did my attachment to it/


The years went by,the song played on the radio now and then,but I never really remembered it that much,the only thing i knew about the song was that it was a love song sung by April Boy Regino. Fast forward 11 years,I was in my room,studying for my college classes,caressed by the gentle breeze that being on the second floor maximized. While browsing through my notes,a shady man with long hair, wearing a baseball cap and a big jacket walked outside our house,acting incognito and keeping his head down. I wondered why he wore such clothing at night,it wasn't cold or anything,but i quickly dismissed my inquisition and resumed studying.The next day,I told the story to one of my classmates(who was a bit older than me),he then raised his arms in the air,then sang ""Di ko kayang tanggapin,na mawawala ka na sa akin"",i asked him how that was relevant to my story,my classmate then told me that my description of the shady man and April Boy's outfit matched,but like all trivial stories,it was talked about then forgotten.


Fast forward a few years later,I was staying in Manila in preparation for immigration to the States,April Boy hit the news with his return to the Philippines and his switch to Godly music.The limited channels available meant that there was no use changing channels to find something interesting.I then remembered something about April Boy,specifically one of his songs,once again ""Honey My Love,So Sweet"" hit my memory.Later that day,I went to a local net cafe,checked my mail and stuff,hit up YouTube,listened to a few songs,then out of curiosity,I searched the song,played it,and remembered the sweetness of the melody,the sincerity of the words,and the nostalgia,but as songs go,it gets stuck for awhile then it goes back to the record bin in our head



Then this morning,while I was browsing through YouTube,i saw the song on the suggested panel,listened to it,but I noticed something with the lyrics.at first,I first thought that the song suffered lazy lyric writing with how the song starts with an ode to unrequited love,then the next stanza basically saying that no matter how the singer's ignored by the one he loves,he's not mad,because he knows deep inside that the lady in question is in-love with him.The chorus is pretty much your generic ""I love you no matter what"" chorus with the exception of ""lagi naman akong sumusunod sa'yo"",that's where I grabbed my tinfoil hat and perused through the song,man I have too much free time on my hands.


While listening to the song again, I searched a wiki on April Boy,then I remembered the comment that my classmate said about April Boy and the shady man that was outside my house.I have to admit,April Boy dressed like someone who was stalking someone else.The lyrics of the song and his trademark attire opened a question,what if the song is about an unrequited lover that went insane then stalked and what if April Boy is indeed writing this from his stalker point of view?It fascinated me that a saccharin pop song could hide such dark undertones,the song that caught my ear as a kid is actually a creepy song,CHILDHOOD RUINED? Maybe,I don't claim April Boy to be a stalking psycho,it's just fascinating to think about a very simple song in a creepier light.


PS:I just wrote this for fun,it's just fan theory.Once again i'm not branding April Boy as a creep,i'm just nitpicking the song and then adding my own theory to it

DDS Characteristics (From my End...),"**DDS Characteristics**

**After all these years, I finally somewhat observe fully the characteristics of most of the DDS.**  After the pandemic began, I observed that DDS/DDS Trolls arise from different social media groups. And in a very period of time until now, I still see a consistent behavior that most of them manifest.

1. **They are very supportive of the current administration.-** I mean all of them to support most of the plans of their ""tatay"" and his allies.
2. **They are close-minded (makitid ang utak)**\- They are the ones who do not want to be challenged with facts and figures. They do not want to receive any opinions in such of the fallacious remarks and performance of this administration.
3. **They are ""auto-taggers.""** \- They are those who cannot defend themselves and starts to tag people as **""dilawan""** or **""communist""** or **""CPP-NPA Members""** without a really factual basis to say. Those who are activists or someone who revolt against the ""wrong move"" of this government.
4. **They are propagandists**\- They are creating a false claim against the opposition by creating memes, leaflets, and sometimes tarpaulins. They are the manipulators of the audience who doesn't know the truth.
5. **They are ad hominems-** Again if they feel that they will lose, they will mostly stalk the account and create a personal claim that will make the person stand back. Yes, unfortunately, it is still in use.
6. **They are unlogical-** I still do not know, why are dds' claims are unconventional and unreasonable.  They are also reacting ""haha"" react when it comes to charity and something good by people.
7. **They are wolves in sheep's clothing-** I have observed that most of them are religious. But still are fake people, who only sought to have God's graces while pushing for immoral plans of this government.
8. **They are dependent on the opinion of their fellow DDS-** They are using the opinion of some DDS especially ""**Banat By"" and ""Mocha Uson""** to use as a rebuttal against the opposition.
9. **They are weak- In lieu of the 8**th Characteristics, if we look further, we can see that they are weak. They are just people who once that believe in the promises of Duterte. They are just people who have been manipulated by others too.
10. **They are Pro-China-** Seriously they are pros since that China has been an ally of Duterte since he sat in power.

\--------------------------------------------x

**Disclaimer-** This is just my mere opinion, I do not know if some people think this way. But please do not tag this as if I'm speaking against the government. I'm just speaking for the truth and holding on to integrity. After all, why not?

To be a Filipino, someone should have the bravery as a lion and the integrity of a tree. DDS are not Filipinos but a puppet. Something that I am very sad to realize.

\*I might add if I observed again.

Thanks!

Currently dealing with a (possibly psycho) stalker. Any suggestions on things I can do?,"Hello everyone! Been a long time lurker here and this is my first post. I would like to ask some help/suggestions on what I can do with my current situation. So I recently acquired a stalker. I met him back in November 2014 and he seemed nice but did not think more about it. Fast forward to December and he confesses that he loves me--after just talking with me TWICE. I told him I can't return his feelings. He insisted however to see me and give me gifts. Eventually, I started noticing that he was a little crazy in the head. I am not sure if I even want to reveal all the awkward details he started doing and telling me here. He would usually call me 16 times on the cellphone, lie constantly, he would corner me, try to touch me, and go so far as yell at me about his feelings AFTER I HAVE MADE IT CLEAR I DON'T HAVE FEELINGS FOR HIM. Then in late February this year, I found out that he has a pending molestation and forgery case. Today, he tried calling me and sent me over 20 messages just telling how he loves me so much and how he thinks I want him too (WTF). I know it is not so bad (yet) compared to other cases but I was just wondering if I can do something about this, like is there a Restraining Order I can acquire? I've heard about filing a blotter case and thinking of doing it. Where can I buy pepper spray/taser that I can bring with me wherever I go? I'm just really afraid he might snap and do something really bad. 

And oh, he is a seminarista by the way. What the actual f*ck.


&nbsp;



EDIT: My family and the seminary know about this since the seminary is only a few blocks away from our house. He has been kicked out and banned from our street. He still keeps on calling me and sending me messages. He also insists on meeting me outside (which obviously I will not do). My family knows: my mother does not want us to file a blotter probably because she does not want to cause any more trouble, my sister knows but she's pretty blase about it, my father knows now but he lives far away from us.   

I forgot to mention that, aside from being a pathological liar, he has used emotional blackmail on me and was reported to be recently stalking another girl.


&nbsp;





UPDATE: He sent me a message again an hour ago. It read, ""It's hard and it's too difficult for me that we didn't see each other and I hate that I will lost u. I'll come to visit u soon..."" SHIT. 


&nbsp;


  
**EDIT 2: Thank you everyone for your kind and helpful suggestions here. I have narrowed down all your messages into three major points:**

1. Talk to a lawyer

2. File a blotter case

3. Cease any and all forms of contact

**Your messages have helped me a lot! I feel less anxious and ""scatter-brained"" now. It also helped that some people have experienced the same horrible thing so I wouldn't feel so alone and isolated in this situation. From the bottom of my heart, thank you internet strangers! I will post updates here soon enough :)**

\-the shallow, petty, ""hugot"" mentality that stalks the country, and the media poisoning young Filipino's take on love

\-the emergence of mental health issues in our country

\-the powerful grip of religion in our country

I wanted to share my three favorite Alain lectures. One about ""romantic love"", second about ""Success/Career Anxiety"", and lastly, a much sensitive one, regarding ""Religion"". I suggest watchiing with captions as he speaks really fast.

**Romantic Love**  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-iUHlVazKk&](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-iUHlVazKk&) 

**Success/Career Anxiety**  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtSE4rglxbY&](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtSE4rglxbY&) 

**Religion for Atheists** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br8m2S98HU4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br8m2S98HU4) 

I was motivated to post these lectures since there's engagement here in the sub regarding the topics. I don't care if at the end you reject everything, feel free to think for yourself. I myself don't agree 100% to everything he says. I may or may not reply sa mga magco-comment, di ako magaling makipag debate and I just end up insulting people. But feel free to share your insights regarding Alain's ideas.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/fcqqar/ideas_and_lectures_for_my_fellow_millennials_that/,t2_obb7e,2020-03-03 14:47:03,4
I wonder how many fake news will generate after the Resorts World Manila Incident,"-Si Bam aquino mei kagagawan neto! Binayaran nya terrorista pra sirain si Lord Digong!

-Andito na ISIS!!! Kelangan na ng Martial Law!!!

-Walang hiyang US yan!! binayaran nila terrorista pra guluhin tayo!! Putang ina mo Obama!

-Kelagan naten ang China!! Because when we're hungry China will keep us alive!

The problem with Duterte's 'rape' joke,"Duterte claims that his rape joke is just how men talk, yet this is the very problem with it. His words effectively condone rape. He makes light of it. He ignores the plight of rape victims, the lifelong trauma that they carry as a result. Duterte's 'joke' is made worse by the fact that the victim he jokes about was murdered. In the USA a movie has recently been released which highlights the issue of rape and its effect on its victims. I've shared an article below on the movie because it has application in the Philippines following Duterte's 'joke'. This article points out that:

>'Cat-calling, ""jokes"", intimidation, touching, groping and stalking are all forms of violence and they are outcomes of social attitudes that implicitly condone rape'. 

While the movie is set on US campuses and the article is Australian, it has its application in the Philippines, and for that matter every country. Duterte is a man of influence. He has charisma and many of his followers forgive him for much of the stupid things he says or does, because of his achievements in reducing crime, yet his rape 'joke' is serious. It is not a joke. Rape is not a joke. It is a very serious crime. There will be men who feel empowered to harass or abuse women because of Duterte's behaviour and comments.
