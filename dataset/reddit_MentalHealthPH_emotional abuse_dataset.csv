Emotional Abuse since I was a child,I don't remember anything and it was vague memory but sudden flashbacks made me remember that I went through a lot since I was a kid. Sinisigawan sigawan ako ng magulang ko sa pagkakamali ko at pinagpalo palo at sinasaktan. Bawal ako umiyak ng malakas kasi maririnig ng kapitbahay tangina naman oh. I am tired of this trauma and I have been to therapy din and its draining to talk about repetitive events all the time.

"My mom's been verbally/emotionally abusing me and starting tomorrow, I'll stand up for what's right no matter what.","""*Lahat naman halos gusto ko ibigay s inyo kahit mga tamad kayo!""*

&#x200B;

For the past few years I've been staying with her, I have nothing but hope that we'll eventually be in good terms one day. I know that she's been trying to understand me and started acknowledging a few things I've done for her. I just don't think that it'll ever be enough. That in her eyes, I'm always going to be a failure and that I'll never be enough.

&#x200B;

Earlier today, we had a misunderstanding and just like she always does, she blamed it all to me. Ever had your parents get mad at you and then your other siblings will be involved na sa galit nila towards you? That's how my mom would do it. 

&#x200B;

This time, **I'll do whatever it takes to be heard**. I'll keep calling her out especially if she's saying something hurtful towards me (or my siblings for that matter). Even if it's going to cost my relationship with her. I'm going to start setting aside my emotions and handle them quietly on my own or with people who really cares about me. I've got this.

Tw: self-harm and suicide

Last year, after everything came crashing down. The years of trauma from verbal and emotional abuse I received from my father led me to overdosing. I was saved by my mother and best friends.

Now, I have received the same, or at least very similar trauma from another loved one and I dont think I can carry the weight of similar trauma for long.

I will try. But I'm falling back into bad habits of alcohol and self-harm. And I dont know how long I can hold on.

I am thinking of living away from my parents due to traumatic memories that keeps me think about it up to now. I was emotionally and mentally abused by my parents since childhood. Sinasaktan nila ako at sinisigawan kapag nagkakamali ako. It stopped siguro grade 5 dahil sinumbong ko sila sa kaklase ko and teachers pero iniisip ko na that time tumakas. The memories were vague enough that I don't want to remember bigla nag flashback sa akin ngayon. I am staying with them until now na college na ako. I have a condo pero hindi ako maiiwan iwan nila tsaka iniisip ko sila din naman magbabayad kung saan man ako pupunta. Gusto ko mag part time to have my finances pero hindi ko alam if may oras pa ako.

Should I get therapy if I don't feel any connection/love for my mom?,"It's my mother's 65th birthday today.

I (32,F) haven't talked to her in months since there was a major falling out within my family (my individual parents, because they hate one another too, with us, their children)

I realized I don't have an emotional connection with her. It feels like, she's just there? I don't feel any particular attachment or love that I feel like I should. Looking back, she did take care of our needs, but she was never there emotionally for us.

As physically and emotionally abusive my father was, he was the one who we mostly had an emotional connection with. He's just really unstable and badly needed some anger management. Weirdly, he's the one that I miss most of the time. Ironically, he's also often the topic of my previous therapy sessions. It was never my mom, because she really didn't do anything wrong. Or anything particularly good?

She was just.... There?

When my husband asked what my mom was doing when my father was ""disciplining"" us, I realized the answer was ""nothing."" She didn't speak, she didn't mediate. She was just there. Like a vase.

I also just realized I never had a proper conversation with her as a child, talking to her mom. The only ones I can look back on was her unloading how much she hated my dad. I know she's been abused too, but why do I still feel less love towards her than my dad who screwed us all up mentally and emotionally? (All three of us siblings have or are going through therapy/medication. They were also diagnosed.)

I do treat her from time to time. Buy her stuff, order her food she wants to eat, and sometimes give her some allowance/pocket money. But looking back, I all did it just because she's my mom, like it's something I should do, a part of my responsibility as a child. I never felt that way when I treat my dad. With him, I felt proud & accomplished.

I also realized I've never actually hugged and kissed my mom. Like maybe when I was a toddler, maybe I could have? But for as long as I remember, I have not. Not even once.

Is this something I should get another session for? I honestly feel weird realizing all of this. Almost guilty. And just now, I also just realized why I have an unhealthy relationship with my MIL but not with my FIL.

Brain dumping on Substack,"Sometime in the middle of this year, a couple of friends introduced me to Substack, an online writing platform.  It's like a blog but with a subscription.  While I do maintain a journal, I've never had a blog/vlog in the past. But then it suggested that I start writing so I did. Needless to say, it was magical.

I unloaded so much childhood hurt, trauma, and an ongoing cycle of emotional abuse at home. My friends who got to read some of my entries were surprised to read about what was going on with me. I too was surprised to finally acknowledge some truths that were never given names in the past. I never thought how relieving this type of vulnerability could be.

One of those friends who inspired me to write and who's a legitimate writer in NY said this over the weekend:

>""Hindi ko alam pano ka nakakasulat with such emotional maturity given everything you've gone through.""

And sa totoo lang, hindi ko rin alam. I just let the words flow.

And,

>""Ang ganda ng latest Substack entry mo. Very compelling read. Nalatag mo ng maayos yung 'academic' na concept and na-contextualize sa real life example.""

Most days I no longer seek for validation. But reading those words has definitely brightened up my week. 

Kaya I'm here to say that for those who will chance upon this post, might I suggest writing your *thoughts* and *emotions* down on Substack. It's cathartic and encouraging... A bringer of hope.

I have OCD and I fear I harmed a child,"
Hi. I suffer from severe OCD caused by emotional abuse. I’m on meds and I’m in list for a therapy. I have a strange compulsion.  I lick my lips sexually and slowly with a sexual expression in my face,like I’m seducing someone. In order to see how this could be seen by others, I did this looking in glasses of parked cars. Now I’m afraid. What If there was a child in it? What if he/she saw me? I think he/she could feel scared, especially if he/she was 11-12 years and can understand sex. Or maybe he or she had an history of sexual abuse. The possibility of hurting a minor is a nightmare for me. 
What do you think? Did I harm a minor?
P.s. I’m trying to not doing this compulsion now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/z6sygd/i_have_ocd_and_i_fear_i_harmed_a_child/,t2_ujrvi8el,2022-11-28 18:19:28,0,6

"Have you ever thought that therapy would fix everything, and it just hasn’t? And now you’re just more depressed","TW: suicidal thoughts, mentions of SA

I was really excited to start seeing a psychologist and psychiatrist because I’ve been having mental health problems since I was really young. I was in survival mode for most of my life, and honestly just clung on to the hope that everything would work out once I’m financially stable and could afford seeking professional help. I worked 1-2 jobs to put myself through school, then worked 16-hour days after I graduated to save up.

I started seeing a psychologist January of last year and a psychiatrist July of last year. I can’t say I’ve found someone that’s a good match for me yet. Meds didn’t really help? I’ve tried sertraline, escitalopram, aripiprazole, serotia. I’m currently on 75 mg lamictal (will add +25mg every 2 weeks) and haven’t seen much of a difference. I can’t say nagkulang ako with the work because I’ve done everything in my power for me to have a good life. And kahit wala akong emotional support I’ve sought mental health professionals and even spent a lot of time doing my own research. I have PTSD and just got diagnosed with BorderlinePD. I haven’t started DBT yet because I’m currently on a tight budget until January 2024.

I don’t think I can spend the rest of my life feeling this way. I’m really tired of trying to help myself. I’m honestly thinking if ending my life would be easier because I just don’t think it’s worth living this way. I can’t handle anyone saying life gets better because I’ve been waiting 26 years for life to get better, it hasn’t. I’ve never had a happy moment. I’ve went through physical and emotional abuse, sexual assault, neglect of basic necessities when I was a kid, and spent my teens and early 20s just working to survive. I’ve handled all of this alone. I’m sure I’m a strong person, but I just can’t take anymore of this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/17lu0h7/have_you_ever_thought_that_therapy_would_fix/,t2_ay3xacwt,2023-11-02 11:01:42,12,7

""Tiis lng jud ate"" That's what my mom used to say. 

Now look where it got me. I have trouble fitting in at school and college, always on edge whenever someone talks to me, I  hurt my bf and the list goes on and on.

So every time na lasing yung tatay ko and nasa bahay si mama or nasa mood makipag away, nagsisigawan sila. Dating OFW mama ko and netong pandemic lang umuwi. 

Ung room ko, malapit sa hagdan, so rinig ko pag nagsstart na ung sigawan nila. Eto ung problem, madalas totoo ung sigawan, pero may mga times na hindi. Ung feeling na parang may nagsisigawan kang naririnig, very muted na tipong di mo na naiintindihan ung sinasabi pero alam mong nagsisigawan. Pag binuksan ko ung pinto, wala naman nagsisigawan, at all. 

Nattrigger to pag nakita ko ng lasing si papa, tas narinig ko na sya na nagmamaoy (which is the triggerpoint ng sigawan nila ni mama). After ko magtago sa kwarto, mga ilang oras, maririnig ko ung sigawan. As in feeling ko talaga nagsisigawan sila tas need ko na bumaba kasi need ko kampihan si mama or baka saktan sya ni papa.  Tas pag silip ko, wala namang maingay. Need ko na ba pacheck up? is this a sign of something worse?

last night i was asking mom about something i was looking for. i didn't know what got her mad but i think it's because i was constantly asking her about it and she started kicking me. i shouted at her and told her why was she kicking me. she then told me i was rude for talking back and said that i was ""psychotic"". she then started to yell at me and i was trying to ignore her.

Living with someone who has depression and alcoholic,"Hi. I am living with someone who is alcoholic and has depression. And it’s already taking a toll on me. I don’t know what to do. Feeling ko mababaliw na ko. I’m planning to seek a psychiatrist but I’m still saving up money for it. 

Growing up, I witnessed how my father abused alcohol and how he verbally abused my mom. I’m turning 25 this year and honestly I don’t have a memory of him na walang episode kapag nakakainom. So meaning, bata palang talaga ako nasanay na ko na ganun father ko. 

He was diagnosed with fatty liver last 2020 due to alcohol consumption and he was clinically diagnosed with depression last year. After he was diagnosed with fatty liver nung 2020, wala pang 6 months bumalik siya ulit sa pagiinom. Pa-red wine muna nung una then eventually bumalik na naman sa hard drinks like gsm, alfonso or soju. When he was diagnosed last year with depression naman, the doctor gave him antidepressants. He took that for a while, only less than 2 months. But while taking that, he did not stop drinking alcohol. We explained to him na masamang pnagsasabay ang alcohol and antidepressants. Pero ayaw nya maniwala. So pinapili namin sya, magpagamot or uminom ng alcohol. And he chose alcohol (: 

There’s a routine kapag nagrarant sya. Lahat ng nangyari sa kanya sinula nung nawalan sya ng trabaho, hndi na sya nagtry maghanap ulit. And up until now, he’s blaming it to my mom. My mom still accepted him. Loved him. Gave everything to him. Nakapagtapos kaming magkakapatid with the hardwork of my mom but kahit ganun father ko, we still treated him with respect. Never namin pnaramdam sa kanya na wala syang trabaho. Kasi okay lang naman eh, ang gusto namin maramdaman eh yung alaga nya. Yung pagiging tatay nya samin. But I guess he failed to do so. 

I think we already did everything we can. Yung ibang kapatid ko hndi na umaasang magbabago sya. He was surrounded by us— his family na binibigay lahat sa kanya pero ni minsan hndi nya naappreciate. Everytime na nakikita ko syang umiinom, natatakot na ko at hndi makatulog dahil alam ko na mangyayari. Ilang years na ko nagsusuffer from insomnia because of that. I’m thinking to move out pero iniisip ko ang mom ko pati yung youngest sister ko kung sino kikilos sa bahay pag wala nako. Cause my father stopped being a father for several years now. 

He’s not hurting us physically… But grabe verbally. Sana nga physically nalang. I think I’m emotionally abused. Don’t get me wrong— I love my father. I do love him so much na kahit ganito sya ayoko parin mawala siya sa mundong to. Nilalagay ko rin naman situation ko sa situation nya.

Dissapointed in myself,"Hi. I joined a fandom late last year sa X. Nag-open lang din ako ng account para doon. Napansin ko na these past few weeks na napabilang ako doon, gumanda ang mood ko, naging chill ako as a person. I have bipolar 2 and depression btw. Dahil nga sa napapadalas ako doon, nakikilala ko yung mga madalas active at parang popular fan accounts. One time, nagkagusto ako sa isang madalas mag-space. I really like her voice, tipong nang-aakit and maarte in a pretty way. So I talked to her in dm. She’s nice naman. Early on, nagpakita na ako ng motibo like harana, kinakamusta. Ewan ko pero pansin ko parang di ko controlled yung emotions ko pag kunwari nanunuyo. Parang may adrenaline rush. Tipong medyo oa and makulit.  Any answers kung bakit? She rejected me naman in a nice way. Tapos ako, naging makulit like everyday magchat. Until, di na sya nagreply sakin. After that, may kinaibigan ako. Sa umpisa, ok pero kalaunan, nagiging one sided. Ako lagi yung umaalam nung sitwasyon nya. Laging puro tungkol sa kanya yung convo. Kapag iniinject ko yung tungkol sakin, parang bored sya. Tapos balik na naman sa kanya yung topic. Dumating sa point na nung medyo malungkot sya, nag-send ako sa gcash ng 250 para gumaan ang loob nya. Pangkape ba. Bukal naman sa loob ko pero deep inside, parang bumibili ako ng friendship. After ilang usap, di na din sya nagparamdam. May iba na syang kinakausap na friends.  Pakiramdam ko, bakit ganun? Sobrang kulit ko ba magchat at boring kausap para iwanan ako sa ere. Alam ko mababaw ito pero nakakababa eh. Siguro I’m a bit old enough para makasakay sa kanila? 32 ako and mostly ata sa kanila eh mid to late 20s.  Medyo lonely kasi ako. Yung mom ko, di ko masyado nakakausap. Yung kapatid ko nasa ibang bansa. Friends? Isa lang madalas ko kausap. Tapos busy pa. May balak akong kitain na college friend kaso di ko na gaano kaclose. Lagi lang ako nasa kwarto dahil ayoko makainteract tatay ko na emotionally abusive. Ang lungkot ko ngayon at ang baba ng tingin sa sarili. Na tipong naglabas pa ako ng pera para sa isang kausap na balewala rin pala. 
Naging sincere naman ako dito sa friend na to. Tipong gusto ko pa sana ichat after a few weeks. Kaso nagmumukha akong desperado.

How do I fix things?,"Hello, Mental Health PH! I've been wanting to ask help kasi hindi ko na rin alam 'yong gagawin ko. My boyfriend and I are trying to help each other pero we always fail. Whenever negative discussions arise and negative emotions are start to come out, he would flip out and lose control of his anger sa mundo. I would be the catch-basin for all of those emotions he has. Then, if I feel na napapagod ako, I would openly tell him about it but he would start to flip out uli and I would either get hurt physically kasi pipigilan ko siya magpakamatay out of anger or emotionally kasi he would tell me hurtful words that triggered my episodes na multiple times. How can I save him from committing suicide? How can I help myself?

To have more context, the reason why he is so full of anger is because he lives in an abusive household. We also had relationship issues before that made him mad pa lalo sa sarili niya because he did wrong things to me that aren't morally acceptable. As for me, I came from an abusive household too and nakaalis naman na ako from there. I live alone but I'm battling with Rheumatic Heart Disease, PTSD, OCD, and Tenosynovitis.

Divorce in the Philippines," Hello! I am a university undergraduate from Singapore preparing for my final year thesis, a documentary about Divorce in the Philippines. Through our documentary, my group and I wish to raise greater awareness regarding the lack of freedom that Filipinos face in getting out of an hurtful and abusive marriage, something that is shocking to most people who are unaware of the fact that divorce is not allowed in the Philippines. 

I understand that the Divorce Bill has not yet been effectively legalised, and hence Filipinos are still unable to get a divorce from their partners, despite being in a hurtful, emotionally and physically abusive marriage that many pray to get out of. I am trying to find out more about the real current situation in the Philippines, particularly from Filipinos who are affected by the lack of actions they can take to get out of their marriage and protect their wellbeing. If you are willing to share about your story, or know someone who might be, please feel free to reach out to me by commenting on this post. I would love to have a conversation with you, and rest assured that everything discussed will be kept confidential! Thank you.

"To people who grew up without a parent/sibling emotionally/physically present, How are you?","To people who grew up without a parent/sibling emotionally/physically present, How are you?

Ako I would tear up, feel sad, or trigger an episode whenever I would think about having a parent. 

How does it feel growing up having a father/mother figure?
How does it feel having a parent telling you na they're proud of you? How does it feel hugging your mom/dad?
How does it feel ranting to your parents?
How does it feel to have a ""Kuya"" who can protect you?

I grew up with maids. I never heard any life lessons nor tips from my parents. I don't remember anything tbh. I have this void/emptiness and always yearning for a parent's love.

Hearing ""Anak I'm proud of you"" would melt my heart. I would probably cry within seconds.

Whenever a friend would pat my head, I would melt. Like, I would be so thankful with that small gesture and would make me happy. Thankful ako sa mga tao/friends ko who treated me as their sister. (It's not a flirty gesture para sakin) Mostly maaapreciate ko kasi kahit seconds lang, naeexperience ko.

Fyi, my parents and siblings arent dead. Parents are busy with work ever since. My mom is mostly absent. While my Dad naing househusband and present physically since highschool but he's emotionally abusive and would always threaten us (kids) 🫠 Mom didn't correct him nor comment on how he controls/lectures us. While with my siblings, well they gave me trauma when we were kids. (Hindi ko na babanggitin kung ano basta I could file a case lol) so ayun... no emotional connection as well. They would just use the word ""kapatid mo ko tas ganyan ka"" like wtf dudeeeee baka nakakalimutan mong may atraso ka sakin???


But anyways, how are you today? Do you have tips for me? Can you share something?",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/10mrktv/to_people_who_grew_up_without_a_parentsibling/,t2_vbzjgpdo,2023-01-28 02:08:43,2,5

Very cheap lang sana. Since I recently lost my job. 

Just some info: 33/F residing in Laguna
I recently left my parents' place to live on my own. This is due to my mom being emotionally and verbally abusive towards me.

 I am now in a better frame of mind, but sometimes the feeling of ending it all still kicks in. Especially when I'm all alone and I think of all my worries, mostly financial. 

As for my job, I was AWOL due to what I can only describe as anxiety attacks, where I feel my hands shaking, my heart pounding and feeling afraid of something (I think of my previous boss?)  whenever I start getting ready for work.

Giving up taking care of our sundowners lola – Need help,"tw: subtle topics of unaliving oneself

So, my lola has developed this sundowners thing where she gets all emotional and crazy around 5 PM, and it lasts until 2 AM. She becomes really emotional and tells my mother to go unalive herself. My mom is taking it the hardest, my mom's got the softest heart and can't handle getting yelled at.  
My lola's constantly yelling (REALLY LOUD) about being alone and sad, but the thing is, she lives with us.  
*""Samahan niyo ako!""*  
*""Ayoko na maging mag-isa!""*  
*""Sana (unalive) na kayo!""*  
*""Gusto ko na (unalive)!""*

Again, she lives with us 24/7.

We've tried getting her a helper, but after 3 tries, we gave up. My lola doesn't trust them, accuses them as thieves, and verbally abuses them. We had to let them go to spare them from this. And, we can't afford home for the elders.  
And when we have guests over, my lola flips. Suddenly, she's sleeping and crawling on the floor, begging for food, and acting like we're the worst family ever. Nagpapanggap siyang inaapi kapag may bisita kami sa bahay. It's a whole performance, especially around 5 PM. 

*""Parang awa niyo na pakainin niyo ako""* – My lola is eating the same food we eat and has access to our entire kitchen, pantry, and we always have food available in our refrigerator.  
*""Dito na lang ako matulog sa lapag, may aso naman ako kasama matulog sa lapag""*   
*""Patawarin niyo ako please, nagmamakaawa ako sa inyo""*   
*""Lahat na lang kayo, mas gusto niyo atang mawala na ako!""*

She even begs food from the guests– really acting as if she's abused and maltreated. We can't invite guests over, because my lola does these things. Nakakahiya at nakaka-trigger mga sinasabi niya. 

I work from from home and nakakahiyang mag-Zoom call. Naririnig sigaw niya sa buong bahay at paulit-ulit sinasabi niya. Nakakahiyang mag-unmute dahil rinig siya sa call.

Total quiet is ALWAYS past 2 AM, imagine the puyat. 

Did some digging and found out it's called sundowners, and let me tell you, nakaka-stress sobra at kawawa kami at lalo na magulang ko na pinagcha-tiyagaan lola ko. Lagi umiiyak mama ko, at laging burned out tatay ko. This has been going on for three freakin' years now, and it's taking a toll on all of us.

My parents can't catch a break or enjoy any trips because of this kasi she goes batshit crazy kapag nakikitang umaandar kotse.

I'm at a loss for how to help. Any suggestions or similar experiences out there?",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/185251w/giving_up_taking_care_of_our_sundowners_lola_need/,t2_vw2rasb3,2023-11-27 20:44:21,0,1
Is there a way to report a bad therapist?,"I was diagnosed with PTSD & DID last year due to years of emotional, verbal, physical and financial abuse from my family of origin (parents and older siblings) I'm basically the family scapegoat and finally cut contact early January 2022 and immediately sought therapy. My first therapist was awesome! Very professional, highly intelligent and compassionate. But I sadly had to stop seeing him because my husband and I moved to his hometown, from Visayas to Luzon.

I am currently looking around for a new therapist. One of my MIL's friends recommended someone and we went to see her.

From the moment I sat down and started answering her questions she did nothing but dismiss, invalidate, and even *defend* my abusers and their abuse! She downright told me it couldn't have been as bad I said it was and that I should just stop focusing on the past and forgive to move forward.

I politely told her that the word ""forgiveness"" and the whole religion christianity schtick was very trigerring for me as it was one of the ways my abusive family controlled and abused me.

And do you know what she did? She *KEPT* mentioning it and started sharing her own personal life and how she's a christian and the love of Jesus yadayadayada ~ she went on for quite a while, almost 30 minutes

I told her again and again that it was triggering for me and I was already crying and shaking and begging her to please stop talking about it.

And she gaslighted me and said that *I* was the one who brought it up in the first place (I didn't, she did and I only *asked* her to stop and she *doubled down* and kept talking) and that she was only sharing the word of God and said "" If you don't forgive your abusers, God wouldn't forgive you either. 

*DID YOU KNOW THAT??? DID YOU KNOW THAT IF YOU DON'T FORGIVE GOD WOULDN'T FORGIVE YOU EITHER?!?!""*

At that point I realised it was moot trying to talk sense to this person who kept violating a simple and clearly established boundary despite many attempts on my end to make her aware of it and her actually seeing me having a panic attack over what she was doing.

I walked out of that clinic bombed and it has triggered flare ups of my chronic illnesses that are also a result of the abuse I went through.

Is there anything I can do to report her to the proper authorities? Maybe file a complaint against the board?

I know it may not do much or amount to nothing in the end but it hurts to think that many people seeking help in perhaps their most vulnerable state would be subjected to what I went through. And I can't just leave it alone and do nothing.

Any help or advice is welcome!

Please be gentle I am still reeling from the experience

"Need help, and advice"," 

Hi, I'm a first year college (18) and I recently had a traumatic experience with my current partner.  
please please try to understand first I really appreciate it if I'm the one in the wrong.

TW: Physical Abuse

so technically my partner abused me, literally like physical abuse. Sinabunutan niya ko, sinakal, sinampal, sinapak that I ended up having swollen and bruised face, my blood din sa eyes ko.  
so ofc sasabihin ko what was the reason why it happened, he saw through my phone na may kachat ako sa ig, I told him everything na we talked for two days (AND I KNOW THAT ITS STILL CONSIDERED CHEATING) but please I wont deny it naman kahit hindi kami literal na nagladian or what, the guy I talked to just asked kung san ako nagaaral. pero its still cheating.  
\++Actually pwede ko naman idelete yon kasi I saw it na before handing my partner my phone but then I remembered na some of my cousins will tell me na whenever I asked for something, sasabihin lang nila is ""dun ka magtanong sa jowa mong binubugbog ka"" so being a tanga tanga person, hindi ko dinelete and hinayaan ko siyang makita yung messages, kasi im thinking na kung kaya ba niya talaga kong saktan ulit physically but diko expect yung outcome sobrang worst. I scream for help kasi sa bahay nila yon naganap pero di man lang napigilan ng parents niya. Di man lang din ako kinausap kinabukasan after mangyari yon.  
\+++Our relationship has been toxic na talaga ever since and please wag niyong sabihin na ""why dont you just leave?"" trust me its not that easy. Last year pa nagsimula yung abuse, una verbal lang, ipapahiya niya ko sa family niya, sa public places hanggang sa naging physical and take note minor pako nung first niya magawang saktan ako physically, and hindi siya about sa cheating. Lasing lang siya non and nagalit siya kasi may graduation pictures kami ng mga kaklase ko since gr.7. That was the first, sinakal niya ko and wala siyang emotion while doing it. I know na sana dun palang nakipag break nako pero again, hindi madali I loved that person too much.  
Actually, the sole purpose for this is if pwede pa ba akong mag file ng complain sa mga autorities? Grabe yung trauma sakin, I even need to go to therapy for this, 18 palang ako, yet I experienced this kind of thing na. I have evidence, but only pictures, is it enough? I have been told nadin sa guidance namin sa school na they will help me daw, but hindi ako sure sa outcome kasi my partner has a reputation, his family has money, and tumatakbo siyang sk chairman sa baranggay nila, if ever ba na matuloy yung complaint ko, will it affect his candidacy? please an honest answer will be appreciated. If deserve kong saktan physically beacuse I cheated pleade tell din, but again it was not the first time it happened, ngayon lang talaga ako nag ka courage to speak up.

This happens every day and I know I can't do anything about her behavior. I want to heal, to function better, but I can't do it since I'm still here in her house and I'm not financially capable to move out yet.

Appointment,"Bukas na yung appointment ko sa psych. I've lived with my ex-partner for 8 years who was recently diagnosed as Bipolar. He said na I should have myself checked just to make sure na okay ako. He was physically abusive sakin non and emotionally drained ako non. Ever since nung naghiwalay kasi kami, sobrang lost ko at sobrang different ako.

What if wala lang naman? Or what if meron din ako? Natatakot ako. Hindi ko alam yung process. Hindi ko alam kung ano yung dapat kong maramdaman. Please tell me what I should expect sa ganito.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/wp50uy/appointment/,t2_rhzwafj0,2022-08-16 01:09:45,1,4
How to help someone when you're also sick?,"My sister has major depressive disorder, diagnosed last year. I got to experience the extent of her episodes when I came home for the holidays (note: I moved to Manila from our province because of university). I'm scared of what she'd do because she has suicidal thoughts and I overthink about things and lose sleep over it.

I also have depression (GAD) and panic disorder. So as much as I want to help, I also have a sickness to manage.

My dad's work takes him around different places so he's rarely home and he's the only one my sister wants to talk to. My mom on the other hand, works in our hometown but she's the hardest person to talk to in that she explodes when she's stressed and she's said many unsavory things. She's been like this for a while - in one of my sessions, my psych and I were able to grapple that I may have gone through emotional abuse from my mother.

So how do you help someone who's sick when you're also sick? Thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/f26t4q/how_to_help_someone_when_youre_also_sick/,t2_1zy2bu6i,2020-02-11 18:57:41,6,3

Thinking about Moving Out of My Parent's House,"Hi, good day! I'll post the exact trigger warnings before I discuss my story so here:

TW: sexual abuse, child molestation, and depression

Last June of 2022, I had my first therapy appointment because in reality I had not been feeling well mentally. It only took one session for my doctor to diagnose me with MDD. The story is I was molested when I was a child, I remember trying to sleep and there was this man who shoved his fingers down my pants. I was frozen and didn't know what I could do. I thought I dreamt that up but this man continued to do it for several years. 

I have known that man since I was a child since he is a very close friend of my father. Whenever he would stay at our home, he'd find ways to touch me, passing it off as a ""massage"", starting from my foot and rising up my body to grope my private area and my chest. He'd do it especially when my parents aren't around. At the time, I really didn't understand what was happening, I was only so young. He'd ask me if it was ok to ""massage"" and I don't usually respond because I was frozen, during the whole time he'd do it, I just dissociate and imagine something in my brain until it passes.

He continued doing that but it got worse in 2020-2021. Since we didn't have a helper at our home, he was tasked to take care of us so it would just be him, my brother, and I. I'd spend most of my time in my room but when I have to eat or watch TV, he'd start doing those ""massages"" again. By that time I was already 15-17 and at this point, I had really thought I'd get used to it. If you asked me why I didn't report this to my parents: (1) I felt immense shame and guilt, I felt so dirty to have been touched by someone who is supposed to be an adult (2) I felt that if I told them, my father would hate me for it. He's much closer to this friend of his than he is with us and I have always tried to seek my father's approval, reporting him (the guy) as the perpetrator would only damage our relationship. Or, I have a fear that no one would believe me if I said something and that people would say that I'm only ""faking"" what happened. Additionally, he'd always do it when my brother is not in the room.

Either way, it led to me having depressive episodes, I didn't know it yet but I would not shower for days, I would starve myself just so that I don't have to be around him, and I didn't care about my grades anymore because I'd rather be in bed. It was such a difficult time for me and my whole social life, emotional health, shs grades, and mental health suffered badly.

Sooner or later, we were able to find a helper and because of that, he was no longer needed in our house; instead, he'd go with my father wherever he goes. I just wanted to say that I felt like I was emotionally manipulated into thinking he was a good guy, since he'd usually take my side in things but now I realize that despite those memories that doesn't erase the fact that he's a disgusting pedophile and a  sexual abuser who took advantage of a minor.

After those events, I had become better, I started being able to take care of myself again and I became so happy knowing I didn't have to experience that again. But the thing is, I kept that whole thing by myself. And maybe that's why the whole time I was just so angry and upset. My ex boyfriend and I were in a relationship during that time and I'd say that he took the brunt of my anger. Anything - whether big or small - could make me tick. I was essentially toxic and would emotionally and verbally abuse my brother and my ex. I just couldn't handle my anger.

To cut it short, I decided to cut off my relationship with him and decided to socially withdraw from all my friends last year. I spent my time just watching shows and movies. I felt that in my anger and experience, I wasn't dealing with it healthily.

That's why I convinced my mom to get me to therapy and I broke down on my first appointment to my doctor about all of these experiences. She considered me for PTSD, BPD, or MDD but she settled with the lattermost condition. It felt so good to finally be able to tell someone about it, I felt as if the weight of being SA'd was lifted, even by a bit. Also yes, I recognized I was toxic and started repairing my relationships with my family and friends , and because of her, I managed to deal with my emotions and MDD. I was also prescribed anti depressants for it.

Now in April 2023, after almost a year of that event, I feel really numb to be honest. I still have recurring depressive episodes and my doc had to up my dose to 30mg Fluoxetine. Even then, I'd still see the guy at least 2x a month and lately, I've been having flashbacks to the SA that happened. For example, I go out of my room and see the couch where the ""massages"" happened, Id have intrusive and wanted memories of it. And essentially, I no longer feel safe in my own house. My doctor mentioned this as my mental health would still be impacted when he's around. It's not as worse as it was but I still have low energy and motivation for anything in my life.

So what I'm trying to say is I want to convince my doc to convince my parents if it's possible to change my environment - that being, the physical. Because maybe if I move out of town, I don't have to see him as much and I don't have to be under the suffocating hands of my semi-toxic parents. My mom is improving naman with dealing with this (context: she's a christian who thinks that this happened because I don't pray to god anymore) but my father on the other hand invalidated my experience by saying that, ""it is something that I should forget because it's in the past."" Still, my parents act like it's a nuisance to them and told me not to divulge this at all to anyone for the fear of judgment and stigma. 

Either way, I'm really hoping that by studying out of town or just being out of my hometown will help me improve my mental health. Any thoughts/advice on this?

TL;DR I was abused as a child until I was almost an adult (5-17) by my father's best friend, mainly in my own home. Hoping to convince my psychiatrist if it's better for me to study outside of my hometown so my environmental stressors lessen. Would love your thoughts on this, thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/12zbgo4/thinking_about_moving_out_of_my_parents_house/,t2_d7bygbnc,2023-04-26 16:55:59,1,5
"Should I switch to another psychiatrist? If yes, do you have recos?","I've been seeing this St. Luke's-based psychiatrist since August 2018. She diagnosed me with Persistent Depressive Disorder and ADHD (I dunno which type but maybe combined?). Now I've told her nearly everything about me, like the fact that I was bullied by my peers and physically and emotionally abused by my parents as a child. Last Friday, my mom hit me repeatedly in the head for ""talking back to her"". My dad told me I deserved to be beaten up kasi I ""was egging on my mom"". I asked my psychiatrist for help through text but received none (it's been 5 days since I texted her, but still no reply haist). Our sessions are basically listening to me talk about what happened to me since our last session and then after my 1hr is up she gives me my prescriptions (I take 5mg vortioxetine and 50mg quetiapine/night for my depression and 36mg Concerta/day for my ADHD). My entire family is forcing me to make peace with my parents even though I'm not yet emotionally ready for a reconnection. With no help forthcoming from anyone, I feel trapped and there are times wherein I think nothing makes sense. These past few days I've been more irritable/moody than usual, and I'm also somewhat more passively suicidal than I normally am (existential angst + childhood trauma lol). I haven't told my psychiatrist about this new development though because I feel like she doesn't really care, what with her radio silence on my latest text and her demeanour during our sessions. Also, my psychiatrist charges 4k/session, which is really too much IMO. All these are seriously making me want to switch psychiatrists, but do you guys think doing so would be wise/advisable? If yes, do you guys have recos (pls include the price huhu)?",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/lizuga/should_i_switch_to_another_psychiatrist_if_yes_do/,t2_3scvvcay,2021-02-13 20:40:04,5,8
free consultation/counselling?,"ever since i stopped getting my medication, my anxiety's gotten worse. 

i stopped my medication because my narcissistic parents who refused to get me treated. 6 months akong naka Escitalopram and Quotia prescribed by my doc who ive seen twice lang. i got the meds before kasi my dad was in a good mood dati. and now he's changed like he's always have. one day kala mo maayos na pero the next he takes back everything he's said. i started my meds on Oct 2021 and i stopped on April 2022. the withdrawal symptoms were fucking brutal pero nung June parang wala ako naramdaman. 

me and my abusive dad had a big fight 5 months ago and it resulted into me moving out to my lola's. at first, i felt relieved kasi wala na ako dun sa toxic household na yun. i think he has bipolar disorder pero di pa diagnosed kaya di maayos ang aming relationship. tiniis ko na lang mabuhay sa mga manbaby tantrums niya, sa pananakit, constant emotional abuse, etc. 

i really thought things were going so well on June up to July when i moved out. sobrang light nung feeling ko. i wasnt that anxious. i felt the confidence that ive been longing to have. and for the first time, i didnt want to kill myself. i was meeting new people, making new friends, having fun.

now i've spent most of my days laying in bed; no job. ive been meaning to get a job pero i cant bc of my anxiety. 

ive isolated myself from my friends. the only contact i have is my s.o. who ive recently broken up with bc of my mental health. 

sobrang irritable na rin ako since im living with my grandma who has a hard time hearing. 

i asked my mother, kasi di ko na kaya talaga, if she can hook me up with a doctor from the hospital shes working in (she's a nurse) pero sobrang busy daw niya and di kaya sa budget. i told her it's okay if di niya kaya or pwede.

i know that i can still achieve my goals and dreams in life. i know that i dont want to kill myself pero meron talagang pumipilit sakin na gawin yun. my mind is so fucking mean and i want it to stop being mean. i do try my best everyday. i try not to be in bed all day and try to help around with my grandma. 

anyway, so ayun jaha.. i really need professional help but idk where to look or where to gef it. siguro may anxiety din ako from consultations kasi ung last time sinabi ko sa neuro psych about my problems, she me me feel invalidated. pero idk... i've grown and i feel like i can take anything na..

I think I'm a psychopath but not the serial killer type,"So I would like to ask the community if I am a psychopath or just a broken man trying my best to live with the trauma that was inflicted to me when I was young. 

About me: 

* Sexually abused when I was 4 and 6 years old and even when I was in college but I don't really feel anything about it. I do use it sometimes so people can relate to me. 
* Middle child, the only physically abused kid of the family who is hated by his dad because I was/am very brave and palaban. I've held a knife in front of my dad when I was 10 while shouting at him.
* Dad almost cut me off but I was able to look for ways, I was able to become independent at the age of 16, fully financially independent at the age of 20. 
* Started self harm (cutting) for coping and later on for pleasure and for more reasons. I look at twitter beans and styro as a past time or when I want to sleep. I'm not one of those emo asking for help and attention.
* Not suicidal but I've done some dangerous stuff just because I feel like being crazy. Not afraid to die as well not because I believe in after life but because I understand the science behind our existence in this world.
* I am very conscious about a lot of things especially on consequences that can benefit me. 
* Intelligent, I guess. Very rational.  Graduated in a prestigious Uni. I am very calculating. I am of course very skilled and have an awesome career. I've never felt insecure as well. I feel like I've always controlled how my brain works.
* Very unemotional -- or should I say controlled reactions. I am able to show emotions of course but I am so conscious on its purpose that I would always think that it's very manipulating.
* I have trouble understanding love and why a lot of people seem to die when they don't have that connection with other people. 
* I've killed animals -- cute ones, as a culling procedure. Never felt pity but the high that it gave me is scary good. Never killed human beings of course, it's against the law and it's very disadvantageous on my part and there is no purpose for doing it. Also, a big, social animal like us is very difficult to just make it disappear. Such a waste of time and resources.  
* I am very charismatic and I feel like the world is my theater and I am always acting. I have no trouble getting people to like me. The key is to fully separate your ego from the character you're playing. 

I am asking this because I am at my 30s and now realizing that I am very different from a lot of people I've met.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/12x6rp1/i_think_im_a_psychopath_but_not_the_serial_killer/,t2_9gwoyeo8w,2023-04-24 15:03:42,3,20
"[Hi, I'm new here] Relationship grief & thoughts of suicide (23-M).","Its almost a year since my ex-girlfriend left and I have been struggling with my own grief. And its not the simple kind of grief that you cry because its over/gone, its the kind of grief that attacks me anytime of the day even at work that puts me in a horrible episode of loud crying and self-harm (scratching my elbow until it bleeds). Its also the kind of grief that causes me nightmares weekly or monthly and wakes me up to another crying episode. Now the pain and grief is on the level I feel want end my life as form of mercy to myself because how can a person can feel this pain so much? 

Tbh i was never like this before the breakup, but i knew something was wrong with me but didnt have any money to get help or still didnt know where to find free help just to know what was wrong with me.

The reason why my girlfriend left is because i wasn't able to understand her feelings even though i tried so hard too. That she felt neglected and unheard. I did everything i could to give that attention and understanding. In my defense, i was a struggling fresh grad who's new to work and adjusting alot to this new adult life. Of course, I did everything to make her stay. In the end it wasn't enough. After a month she went into a new relationship with her friend (they're a lesbian couple now). Sounds cliche but I loved her unconditionally because I was certain she was the only one showed and made me feel loved and accepted. 

I've asked tried to communicate with her why it wasn't enough to make her stay and why was she willing to move on so fast. All i understood that the love I gave was small and petty, and that her new partner is convenient and could easily offer her emotional needs and wants right away. So I always ask why do I grieve this so much for this one person who showed that my effort and love is so little to almost no value? Why do I grieve this painfully? Why is it so easy for my ex and for other people to jump ships? Why can't I be them? I hate myself for feeling that I'm overreacting over the breakup for months that I shouldn't be hurt with the facts.

I've tried getting help on a local clinic, but i was only able to attend one session because i earn so little and can't go on futher because of other financial responsibilities. I know I need to now because of how bad this grief is now.

I never had a good (maybe abusive) relationship with my parents and I never really had any true friends (they humiliated in the middle of school) growing up. And other a lot of things that I should be talking about in theraphy. Because of those things i feel like I can't process relationship even my relationship with myself and control my own emotions. I know its bad to intellectualize my trauma and grief but this is the only comfort i can give to myself.

I hate how i turned out to be now, and im tired that i have to be responsible of the insecurities and traumas that my abusers and offenders left me. And im tired feeling so much pain when crying or having nightmares that my ex reminding me that I don't deserve love, happiness, and peace because of how im a failure of a partner. I just want end things because of how painful things are now and how it feels like i will never be able recover from this.

Yes there are people or ""friends"" that say comforting things that I deserve better, that you'll find happiness etc etc. I know they mean well but i feel guilty that their words just go over my head and just end up feeling like that i wasted their time.

Tbh im not sure why I posted this here... Maybe to seek answers or a cry for help? Validation maybe? Just to feel that I'm not alone? Idk... Im tired of grieving/feeling this grieve and i can only see my mental deteriorate further. I just want unalive myself just to make things stop, but I'm scared to cause more trouble to other people...",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/15je85n/hi_im_new_here_relationship_grief_thoughts_of/,t2_ui8xiluz,2023-08-06 10:43:41,13,13
Question,"May tanong po ako regarding the psychiatrists, am I the one in the wrong or is it totally normal for them to tell their patients “You can handle this (yourself). I believe that you (alone) can find a solution.” (this is regarding my issue with my emotionally insensitive, narcissistic and abusive parents) and “The entire time you were here, all youve done is complain/ all Ive heard from you is completely negative.” ?

Rant. Complex Trauma.,"To give a some context, I was dating a girl many years ago. She told me she was allergic to condoms, and that she was on contraception. I was young and stupid and too trusting heck, I even saw her use pregnancy tests before she fell pregnant and it wasn't a red flag for me (She told me it was an old habit from her ex LMFAO). Prior to this, she asked me about kids and I always explicitly stated no I don't want them. (I had a bad childhood, filled with trauma and abuse). Anyway... I continued to see her and a few months into the relationship she told me she was pregnant. I had a severe breakdown, lost my career (been through 6 jobs which I've lost due to mental health despite my desire to try) and have been in and out of therapy ever since (7 years). This clearly stems from my childhood, where I was abused in most formats and had many unresolved experiences (I was silenced and forced to keep going, resulting in continued abuse). The person who was abusing told me he saw a porno, and that's what he did to me (he was my older brother and our father left us alone to go to work), and he said he did not know why nobody stopped it. I remember the event in pieces, and i remember telling our father about it when he returned from work.... I also remember my older brother beating me up after and then strangling me, telling me he does not care that he put me in my head, and told me to get in my head and stay in there. Our father made us promise to keep it a secret, and kept telling me nothing happened basically. I was forced to love my older brother with suggestive words such as 'you love your brother dont you', until over years of brain washing i believed that i loved him. Yet the unresolved trauma was still there - the ammunition of my breakdown. After this he was gaslighting me when i wanted answers, and our father gaslit me too trying to make me believe I was going crazy. Not long after this my older brother commit suicide, which has not been easy to handle. I've struggled with suicidal thoughts all my life, i remember as a child i would beg the devil to take me away. My mother was not emotionally present for me either, and when i cried to her about not wanting to go to my fathers she forced me to go, stating she has no one else to look after me (she would complain to my father about the bruises etc, but nothing changed, one time i was forced to tell her i fell down the stairs, when in reality i got the shit kicked out of me) I moved out of my mothers at 12, then stopped going to my fathers because it wasnt forced upon me. I joined the military at 20, and then i had my breakdown at about 23 (which is when my son was born) and have been struggling.... well, all my life. but even more so in recent years, especially since realising why my life turned out the way it did.  


I decided it is best to try and be in the child's life. He is 7. It wasn't until he was 4 that i was allowed to have him alone. I still cant take him out of the city. And many times i would be messed around. For example, i'd be walking to pick him up, and when im about 5minutes away, she will text me saying she doesnt want me to see him today because he's been naughty.... And these things are not uncommon... It just makes me feel like, why the hell do i try? this situation fucked my life up, and im still trying, whats the point? This triggers me, surfaces suicidal thoughts and just makes my life so stressful. A Part of me wants to just leave, become a Buddhist monk, and live a completely new life. These feelings surfaced because i saw her comment on a post about how important it is for a child to have a father figure. And i just feel like, well, i wish i never had my father, he's the reason i have CPTSD and DID, he just abused and neglected me. it's better to not have a father, than have a father who doesnt want you, or is abusive/neglectful.

Filipino Culture and Society on Mental Health,"Maybe I'm being audacious for making this my first post but hey, YOLO!

Hi, I'm James. I am a teenager living in Mindanao. My childhood was marked by trauma, abuse and family dysfunction that deeply affected me. I was always moving and coupled with my natural introversion, I grew up on the internet. I used it both as an escape and a source of interaction that I couldn't receive in real life. This had it's benefits and drawbacks. While I spent the first years watching playthroughs and games, my interests eventually branched out and I watched content that addressed things such as mental health. It gave me a vocabulary for the things I was experiencing and it gave me clarity when I was at my lost. However, the bad part was that I was't interacting with others, English ended up superseding Bisaya as my fluent language. That's the explanation for why this is all written in English. Yes, I was born and raised here. it's ridiculous, I know lmao.

Anyway, that was my upbringing and it made me keenly aware of what the Philippines lacks in helping those who are in crisis. I envy the US and anywhere at all that has the resources necessary to help those who really need it. However, all things considered, this is probably the best way things could have panned out for me. If I hadn't learnt, god knows where I would be now. I look back at and think of how stigmatized mental health was throughout it. I'm unsurprised that things happened the way they did and there are emotions. Anger, sadness, fear. The whole thing. No wonder things went so wrong! There were no resources available to protect me. No number I could call. No professional I could consult. It's not rocket science but I'm just one person.

I have one life and one perspective. I'm sure things aren't the same for everyone so I ask: Why are you suffering? How has our country, with it's lack of support, and our culture, with how uninformed it is, affected that?

How am I going to say that I have a depression to my parents?,"An accident happened earlier in our home and there was an immense banter between me and my father, who is sometimes in a good mood and sometimes not. To make the long story short, it was my fault but I didn't know that an accident will happen because of it. I mean, hindi ko naman talaga sinasadya and nawala talaga sa isip ko. Nasugatan pa si mama dahil sa nangyari pero ako rin naman ang nag-end ng nangyaring accident. My father was busy with his thing and he's just directing, not initiating to move. When everything was finished, hindi pa siya tapos sa kakasalita at indirectly niya lang talaga gusto manisi sa mga pangyayari. This is not new to us, though. He's always like this ever since we were kids and he just wants to victim blame us every chance that he gets. Everyone was high on emotions, hence the unending exchange of words. I'm really vocal when it comes to fights, as I want to speak my mind and I don't want him to step on us just cause he's the ""man"" of the family. He's very authoritative too kaya tingin niya lagi samin ""bobo"". I get it, tinuturuan niya kami pero he just wants to feel highly than us. Basta ang last ko na lang na sinabi is ""Hay. Ang hirap maging bobo! Ang hirap maging hindi perfect!"" 

He's the main reason why I fell into depression and he was the one who caused my traumas ever since I was a kid. All the verbal and physical abuse just haunts me. At times, I would still try understand him but it's tiring, too. I'm not patient that I thought I could be. I don't want to feel this hatred for him until I grow old kaya naisip ko while letting myself cooled down, before this year ends, I want to let them know my MDD diagnosis. I would show them my medcert, my meds before, and my PWD ID and explain to them what I've went through. But, I don't know how would I explain this, as depression and mental health illness is still taboo to them.

To all those who have explained their conditions, what did you do and for those who has the same (father/parent) issues, how were you able to let them reflect that it is because of them why you're seeking professional help?",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/18ste8d/how_am_i_going_to_say_that_i_have_a_depression_to/,t2_9s6cq47q,2023-12-28 21:01:16,1,11
"Should I switch to another psychiatrist? If yes, do you have recos?","I've been seeing this St. Luke's-based psychiatrist since August 2018. She diagnosed me with Persistent Depressive Disorder and ADHD (I dunno which type but maybe combined?). Now I've told her nearly everything about me, like the fact that I was bullied by my peers and physically and emotionally abused by my parents as a child. Last Friday, my mom hit me repeatedly in the head for ""talking back to her"". My dad told me I deserved to be beaten up kasi I ""was egging on my mom"". I asked my psychiatrist for help through text but received none (it's been 5 days since I texted her, but still no reply haist). Our sessions are basically listening to me talk about what happened to me since our last session and then after my 1hr is up she gives me my prescriptions (I take 5mg vortioxetine and 50mg quetiapine/night for my depression and 36mg Concerta/day for my ADHD). My entire family is forcing me to make peace with my parents even though I'm not yet emotionally ready for a reconnection. With no help forthcoming from anyone, I feel trapped and there are times wherein I think nothing makes sense. These past few days I've been more irritable/moody than usual, and I'm also somewhat more passively suicidal than I normally am (existential angst + childhood trauma lol). I haven't told my psychiatrist about this new development though because I feel like she doesn't really care, what with her radio silence on my latest text and her demeanour during our sessions. Also, my psychiatrist charges 4k/session, which is really too much IMO. All these are seriously making me want to switch psychiatrists, but do you guys think doing so would be wise/advisable? If yes, do you guys have recos (pls include the price huhu)?",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/liyyhv/should_i_switch_to_another_psychiatrist_if_yes_do/,t2_3scvvcay,2021-02-13 19:34:08,2,1
I'm almost flipping out,"I am 30M. I will tell you about my story briefly. I grew up in an environment full of women. My parents were together, but you know on paper only. I have a father who loves me so much, and he has been physically there with me, but he left my mother with all the responsibilities and emotional needs that should have been a guide for a son and he lived his own life.

I have always been bullied by boys around me just because I had not been swearing, not speaking inappropriately about girls, or objectifying them. They considered me gay, incomplete, or ""less than a man"". I suffered a long period of abuse in childhood. When I started middle school, I was in a relationship with the most beautiful girl in the school and we stayed in a relationship for 2.5 years, but even then I kept hearing all those insults. At some point, I started to question if they might be right, why I couldn't convince them, and why I couldn't be a ""real man"", just like one of them.

My perspective shifted and I went into a great darkness, I had no idea who I was anymore and I lived almost my whole life in this darkness. I had girlfriends, and I had long-lasting relationships, but I was never able to surrender to a woman, I never let myself go, I never allowed myself to let anyone love me, and I never allowed myself to really love anyone.

On the other hand, I lived my whole life observing the other men around me. On streets, on a bus, in the sauna or gym, etc. Those men became an object for me and I started to compare myself with them by seeing their more masculine side than mine such as being hairier, having sharper features, being more muscular, having a bigger penis, appearing more fearless, having more possessive attitudes, and so on... So, I started to humiliate myself and believe me, this humiliation started to give me pleasure somehow. I was trapped in a cycle where I created situations to humiliate myself and then I suffered.

Then something happened. I met a man 2.5 years ago and he was exactly the perfect example of the object of my self-abasement. But things turned out the way I didn't expect. He didn't humiliate me, he didn't belittle me, he didn't harass me, he wasn't rude to me. He saw me, my inner pain, he showed me his own wounds. He was there for me, he supported me when I cried.

Here's what I can't figure out right now. That man has been so good to me that I have become so attached to him, I can say that I'm co-dependent now. I don't want to live without him, I want to go with him wherever he goes, I want to do what he does. We have been spending so much time together for the last 2.5 years. He has become the center of my life. It's kind of a bromance-like relationship or sometimes I call it ""philia"", he is straight and he is not a sexual object for me, BUT I'm so confused. I really have a hard time understanding if I'm in love with this man, if I'm really gay, or if something else is going on, like after all these years of experience, I was shocked to meet such a person or something.

I have been in therapy for 2.5 years. EMDR has helped me a lot to get rid of my childhood traumas, but unfortunately, I feel too frozen to move now. Where have all my emotions gone, where are my sexual urges, where have my positive emotions gone, who am I, what do I want? I am completely in the unknown and my depression is getting deeper and deeper each day.

I really need someone to talk to me, even if you can't offer a solution. I want to hear something.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/17prlq9/im_almost_flipping_out/,t2_ncugab1vv,2023-11-07 18:48:30,6,2

my brother is a gambling addict and a horrible person and it's affecting me a lot mentally + i'm scared for my pamangkins.,"<also posted sa AskPh>

sorry medyo mahaba to but i wanted to get it off my chest and see other perspectives din.

I (F, 30) have an older brother (M, 37). growing up, naalala ko na kahit bata pa kami sobrang lala ng temper ng kuya ko. nagmumura, nagtatapon ng gamit pag galit. may mga moods syang malambing lalo na nung maliit pa ko (bunso ako). pero never kami naging close kasi ayun nga nakakatakot sya.

feeling ko nagcontribute yung temper nya sa pagiging people pleaser ko. uncomfortable ako pag may galit o may upset na tao. lagi ko tinatanong partner ko kung galit ba sya sakin kahit nageexpress lang sya ng disagreement. napansin ko rin na ""muted"" yung emotions ko. napansin din to ng partner ko. madalang lang ako makaramdam or magexpress ng galit kahit sobrang unfair na ng situation for me. sa mga situations naman na dapat overjoyed ako (like may super good news), parang di ko maaccess yung tamang level ng excitement? naiisip ko baka dahil growing up napalibutan ako ng intense emotions so natuto ako magtone down.

yung kuya ko unang nagkapamilya saming magkakapatid. nung nagkaanak sya dun din nagsimula gambling problems nya. may work sya dati na maayos ayos naman and napapautang pa nga nya mama ko. pero ayun naglaho din lahat dahil sa sugal tapos nagnakaw pa sya sa parents ko at nagbenta ng mga gamit sa bahay. i think college ako nung unang incident.

Pinatawad sya ng parents ko at ng asawa nya after nun pero hindi yun yung last. nung una naawa pa ako sa kanya. naalala ko one time pinalayas sya ng bahay pinuntahan namin sya ng ate ko sa malapit na plaza para dalhan ng damit at pagkain. may time nagtthreaten sya saktan sarili nya pati inuuntog sarili sa pader pinipigilan ko pa.

Ilang beses pa naulit pagsusugal nya. At ang malala, nadadagdagan anak nya. Feeling ko nga twisted way nya para di sya iwan ng asawa nya is mabuntis yung asawa nya eh. Kasi usually nabubuntis yung asawa nya some time after nila magkaayos after ng episode ni kuya.

yung cycle is magsusugal sya --> magnanakaw sa amin --> papalayasin or kusa sya aalis --> babalik na kunwari nagsisisi na at magpapakamabait --> tatanggapin ng parents ko at ng asawa nya --> magsusugal uli

anyway, dahil sa pagiging adik nya di nya magawang buhayin ng maayos pamilya nya. sobrang naging dependent nila sa family namin. samin sila nakatira. ultimo pagkain at pagaalaga ng mga bata samin inasa.

aside dun, sobrang tamad pa. bare minimum kung bare minimum kung magalaga sa mga bata. di mautusan (sya pa galit). di tumutulong sa gawaing bahay. wala syang sense ng hiya na may ibang tao nagaalaga sa mga anak nya.

dahil dun sobrang naging close ko sa mga pamangkin ko. aside from pagtulong sa basic needs, kaming magkakapatid na babae yung nagasikaso sa emotional needs ng mga bata. kami yung nagpapasyal, nagiisip ng mga activities para sa development nila pati nagtuturo ng magandang asal. ayaw namin mafeel na neglected sila.

eto na nga isa ko pang kinakainisan is yung asawa nya. alam ko victim din sya pero mukhang naging codependent na sya sa kuya ko. ilang beses na sya nagsabi na hihiwalayan nya yun pero maya maya naguusap nanaman tapos ayun bati na. sabi nya di daw nya kaya pabayaan kuya ko at ayaw din nya mawalan tatay mga anak nya.

at ang latest development is nasa america na sila ngayon. nurse kasi yung sister-in-law ko at nakapasa na sya after ilang taon ng pagaaply magwork sa america. sinama nya kuya ko, reasoning na need nya katuwang magalaga ng mga bata dun. sa totoo lang feeling ko mas okay na maging single mother na lang sya kesa magkaron ng asawa na kunsomisyon at alagain din.

sobrang nagwoworry ako para sa mga bata. yung 2 older kids aware na sila sa mga ginawa ng tatay nila. tapos sobrang magkaiba ng way nila ng paghandle.

Yung panganay (M, 13) sobrang maingat dahil ayaw nya magalit papa nya. tapos para syang ako, aligaga sya pag may nagaaway o nagsisigawan. tinanong ko sya once kung ano nararamdaman nya towards papa nya. sabi nya okay lang daw kasi at least di sya tulad ng ibang tatay na overly abusive. nalungkot ako kasi parang ang baba na tuloy ng standard nya para sa isang tatay.

Yung sumunod naman sa kanya (F, 11), opposite. nagcoconfide sya na hate nya yung papa nya. as in hate. may isang time na winish nya na yung kuya ko na lang daw namatay imbes na yung isa kong kuya. very intense naman makafeel ng emotion yung batang yun.

iniisip ko kung dapat ko ba kausapin yung sister-in-law ko to do something kasi naapektuhan mga anak nya? honestly kung sila lang dalawa at wala silang anak, wala na akong pake kung gusto nya patawarin ng patawarin ung kuya ko. pero naawa talaga ako sa mga bata. inaalala ko anong magiging impact sa kanila ng walang matinong father figure later in life. tapos pano kung later sila pa nakawan ng tatay nila dahil sa bisyo nya?

pero di rin kasi ako sure pano magrereact yung sister-in-law ko. given na tinotolerate pa din nya kuya, im not really sure kung she has her children's best interest at heart? pano kung mapasama pa mga bata if nagsabi ako? what if sabihan nya mga anak nya na wag magconfide sa mga tita nila? ayaw ko mawalan sila ng safe space. and i want to be that safe space for them.

masyado na ba ako nakikialam? ayaw ko lang lumaki mga bata na broken adults. i think masyado na tayong madami na nagsuffer from traumatic childhoods. how can i help break the cycle?

sorry super haba na. i feel so helpless.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/18z16sr/my_brother_is_a_gambling_addict_and_a_horrible/,t2_csrgtloa,2024-01-05 15:32:35,1,1
So…,"got my pysch battery results thingy a few days ago. And, as my final resort and last hope, its safe to say that I….am finally going to give up on further reaching out for any more “professional help”.

At best, its only 60% accurate, and my suspicions feel like they were biased into believing my parents’ (two of my emotional/mental health abusers) side of the story compared to the actual client’s, and from what ive read from all 10 or so pages, instead of touching upon my deteriorating mental health, forced unhealthy “diet”, and deteriorating everything else such as memory loss, shortening attention span, and going from a gifted kid to an absolute “spoiled waste of resources”.

it instead wrote me off as only having “moderate” depression since they can see how “im still able to function”, accuse me of “making my experiences seem worse than they are” and how its mostly, if not, entirely my fault how all my past psychs have been shitty to me, how my parents are fighting everyday, how everyone i thought were my friends have used and left me, and how nothings going my way. 

what broke my heart is how, the ppl at the psych battery test seemed genuinely concerned for me and, dare i say, gave me a small spark of hope that things will turn out for the better, how the results may hopefully open my parents’ eyes to the problems at hand, but no. it made things worse, and now my parents are using my “moderate” results as leverage saying how im just a spoiled cry baby. 

im sick of everything and everyone’s “help” and i definitely didnt need to spend thousands of pesos just for “professionals” to tell me “i dont have it as bad”. im done. im just…done.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/14jb1xb/so/,t2_5d55zts,2023-06-26 16:07:25,2,1
Lost,"Sobrang mentally at emotionally draining mag-stay sa bahay na ito kaya sana magka-face to face classes na. Nahihirapan akong makisama sa tatay kong sexually harraser, at sa nanay kong enabler at narcissist.  Naalala ko nung nagsumbong ako sa nanay ko way back 2018 when my father tried to touch me tapos wala syang ginawa kundi i-gaslight ako at sinabing paglalambing lang daw yun. She even told me not to tell my sister or anyone around me. As if, eh nakakadiri kaya. I couldn't afford to move out (until now) kasi magsstart pa lang ako sa next journey ko sa med and we all know how expensive it can be. Itong nanay ko, laging binibring-up din yung sexuality ko (I'm bi) every damn time na nag-away kami dahil sa kapatid kong in-out ako without even asking me if I was ready during college. It has been 5 years nung in-out ako and 4 years nung nangyari pero dala-dala ko pa rin sya. Tapos my mom really has the audacity to ask me why am I secretive as fuck and bakit ang init palagi ng ulo ko sa bahay??????? They're all emotionally and mentally abusive. Lol.

I haven't told anyone about it yet kasi nakakadiri and baka ano pa sabihin ng ibang tao. At least dito, anonymous ako. Valid naman yung nararamdaman ko diba?

Review of a therapist recommended on here,"I was seeing the therapist of a clinic or talk space that was in the recommendations in this sub for three sessions and I found this therapist quite effective and good for the price. It was worth it for the sessions I paid for.

However, since the last session we had, I had been feeling unease and discomfort. For context, I have CPTSD and I'm seeing them because I want to work on that, work on my trauma. 

Therapist gives me an assignment of listing down all the unacceptable things my abuser had done to me in an effort to contrast it with a statement that is acceptable.

Two days later, I told therapist I couldn't do the assignment, filled them in that I had been feeling uncomfortable since the last session, as well as I might not be able to continue the assignment because I tried doing it the night before only to be faced with emotional flashbacks that were very difficult to go through while crying. Asked them for advice on what to do, if we should meet again soon, or discontinue the assignment, or any advice or recommendation at all regarding my situation.

Therapist replies that my body is just trying to block and deny my past. If the therapy is not working or is not fit for me, they can recommend me to someone else.

I am in shock with this reply. To me, it came off as dismissive, with a lack of initiative for collaborative work with the patient.

Previous therapy sessions I had been doing quite good and no concerns at all, and the first sign of a concern or a roadblock, this therapist bails on me? Honestly, that wastes a lot of time and effort from my end kasi babalik nanaman ako to square one with a new therapist.

I researched on my own (AGAIN) regarding concern ko with emotional flashbacks and kaya ko din nalaman yung term is because it's one of the symptoms ng CPTSD. It really doesnt take a lot to figure out that living with CPTSD is making this part of the therapy difficult, and need lang ng more guidance and tips for me to handle it in a way that is okay for me. But therapist went about it as di nag wowork yung therapy for me. ok. 👌🏻

Just a review for all of us here. Not recommended kasi nasayang yung buildup ko with the therapist tapos iniwan lang ako sa ere after three sessions and one reasonable concern. And I STILL am not feeling well and wala parin akong advice on what to do about it.

Pero if you want cheap tas okay release ng stress and therapy that makes sense, gow kayo. Just saying this therapist isn't one to adjust their ways and treatment plan based on the client (wc is a huge part of therapy).",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/14vlcvm/review_of_a_therapist_recommended_on_here/,t2_8qhm9yq,2023-07-10 14:00:40,4,1
I slapped my girlfriend. I need help.,"A little backstory to give context to my situation. This is not an excuse. I know I need help. This back story is just for context. 

TLDR: I slapped my girlfriend many times after she reminded me of being sexually assaulted and I feel so fucking terrible. I need professional help for controlling my anger management issues.

—

I have a girlfriend. We are both girls. We’ve been together for 3 years and 4 months. Shortly after we became official, I lied to her about my whereabouts because she didn’t like the people I was gonna meet. I didn’t like them either but I’ve already committed to going so I went. 

The people I was gonna meet were my highschool friends. Long story short, I sort of have an “utang na loob” that’s why I couldnt decline when they told me to treat them for my late birthday celebration. We drank and I had a bit too much and next thing I know, someone was behind me taking off my jeans. I don’t remember all the details, except that something terrible happened to me that night. I only confided about it to just one friend.

Four months later, my girlfriend was going through my phone and found out about it. She was angry, understandably. But I didn’t want to talk about it. I couldn’t bring myself to relive that trauma. I thought we were going to break up. But we didn’t. We stayed together. 

Fast forward to present, my girlfriend and I were drinking. Then we had a misunderstanding. She went to her room and I didn’t bother following. She’s drunk so I figured I’ll talk to her the day after when she’s sober. I was gonna sleep in the living room. 

After some time, she went out of her room and approached me, saying, “Hey, remember when you cheated on me?” I was confused and thought she was just joking. I asked, “wdym?” Then she brought that unfortunate event up. And I was like, “what? How is that cheating? How is being r*ped/sexually assaulted cheating?” 

She says it is cheating because I lied about where I was that day. She went back to her room and I followed angrily asking why would she want to remind me that night and make me relive the trauma. I asked what her point was. She said she never got over it because we never talked about it. I explained that I wasn’t ready to talk about it, that I tried so hard to forget it and that I didn’t want to remember any of it. I explained over and over but she just didn’t care. So I lost it. I slapped her, twice. Then she went as far as saying I went to my highschool friends willingly to get fucked. So I slapped her again. I didn’t know what happened to me. I’ve always known I had anger management issues. But I never laid my hands on her or anyone like that. I never slapped anyone that hard. 

After that, she told me to leave. She didn’t really have to. I was gonna leave. I was ashamed of what I did. 

I initially thought what I did was okay because she was provoking me and practically victim-blaming me for getting sexually assaulted. But that’s not an excuse. I physically abused her. It didn’t matter what’s the reason why I did it. I slapped my girlfriend and I feel like the most terrible person in the world. I immediately knew after that that there is no going back. I love her. I spent the last three years and 4 months of my life dedicating myself to her. We can’t be together anymore. She was emotionally abusing me and I ended up physically abusing her. The relationship was getting toxic. This is the end for us. 

I need help. I don’t know where to start or who to ask. I get mad often that I don’t know how to control it anymore. I don’t want to keep being like this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/uag5nf/i_slapped_my_girlfriend_i_need_help/,t2_cje6e14u,2022-04-24 06:12:50,8,4

long rant about Secretary calling my parent about my appointments w/o my consent,"throwaway account because I know he monitors my main acc. I'm so mad, so so mad right now, I got home and sat down to eat dinner with my father and sister when suddenly my mother barged in and very loudly asked me about if I scheduled an appointment with a psychiatrist at the clinic, I'm pissed off, my father is very clingy, believes he knows everything about me and my mother intentionally did this infront of him so that we'd end up fighting over it, she loves to cause chaos, he is well meaning but has a lot of mental health problems himself, I probably inherited a few tbh. her plan worked, after barging in, revealing everything, I was faced with an onslaught of questions I was not ready to answer in front of him. 

I went 2 weeks ago to schedule an appointment as I have various issues I really don't want to get into with this long ass paragraph. I forgot that it was coming up and to confirm the appointment they called my MOTHER, NOT ME????????? even though I explicitly told the front desk/secretary that my number had ""changed"" this was a clinic I used to go to a lot for an ophthalmologist as a child, its been a while so they asked to confirm my number which I realised was my mother and told them to update it to mine for my account and that that number was ""dead"" she just walked away with a smirk on her face to go back to watching her tv. 

I immediately saw the way things changed with how my father looked at me, it wasn't the same anymore, I didn't ant him to find out I was going, I've been saving up my allowance for weeks so I could pay for this first visit with cash, I have a good relationship with him but he doesn't believe in medication or therapy, I tried gently broaching the subject with him in the past but he's completely engulfed with the alternative medicine route, read a Krishna murti/ sadghuru/ any other self help spirituality book as that has helped all his problems, (it has not, I'm his therapist in a way and yes thats another thing that gets to me). medication is dangerous and should not be trusted as it is all chemicals. 

he is constantly talking about what a wonderful father he is and how he's nothing like his father. but he's far to clingy and dependant on me emotionally, as in SEVERE emotional incest, he isn't a helicopter parent he's a Boeing 737 parent, he searches my room and never lets me forget about it, he found a buttplug I hid under my mattress once, suction cupped it to the middle of my desk and put a post it note with ""don't forget to wash it in between uses :)"" like wow ok, I do, but, I did not need him telling me that but thats not the problem here. I have to talk him down from doing rash things, I have to be his springboard for all his problems since I was a pre-teen. my mother punched me in the head so hard as a child because my father was holding me and she was missed trying to aim for my his head not mine, she didn't intend to hit me and brought me to the hospital so she didn't do anything wrong. 

she's abusive towards him but no one believes it. they managed to separate legally but still live together because she cant face being alone and people knowing her marriage ended. she forced my father to see a therapist friend of hers that she convinced before hand that he was super bad and needed to essentially be on tranquillisers 24/7 and he did them for years before stopping since it was too much for his body and the side effects got bad so she let him stop. he believes the same thing would happen to me and that id be drugged and rendered stupid like he was. but life has gotten too out of hand I cant cope and need professional help badly.

in the end my father is still super mad I kept it a secret from him and that he's the good one and I should only have secrets from my mother only as she's the bad one, but said he'd be willing to help pay for some of my appointments as long as I promise not to take any meds and to only go to a psychologist not a psychiatrist and to stay far away from psychiatrists and that id only be allowed to go as long as he stays in the room with me the whole time. I wanted to be independent and do it myself but it's kind of a win maybe. 

oh also I'm 25M, my dad said maybe the clinic called her since I'm still too young to be doing adult things like scheduling and should have asked him to do it instead next time since I'm not yet old enough to be considered an adult and that they needed a parents consent.

How do we get real help for mental illness?,"I wasn’t even trying to lose weight and I wouldn’t say I had an eating disorder. But as a grown adult in my early thirties I weighed a whopping 85 pounds. For context I weigh 130 now though I definitely feel fat. 

I remember having intense anxiety, and being up most of the night, totally believing if I moved my head at all that I would have a seizure and die. I was not in therapy nor taking medication for it. I was working (though my job didn’t pay worth a crap) and raising a young child as a single parent. 

When I sought help from doctors one assumed my high blood pressure and low weight meant I was a drug abuser and he treated me like absolute shit. Another told me she would prescribe an appetite stimulant *if* my urine test came back clean.

Again, I was not taking drugs. I was traumatized from a lifetime of past abuse and struggling to exist. I’ve seen more cruelty from people at my most sick then I think I’ve ever witnessed. People that are supposed to be caring for the sick, I.e. healthcare professionals, to this day I’m pretty terrified of them.

Without my partner I’m alone in the world and I will surely die very soon. Given my mood disorders and outbursts I am afraid he will leave me. the help they tell you to be brave and ask for doesn’t exist, at least not that I’ve seen, I’m not sure what the point of this post is, just that I’m realizing that after this I did end up on psychiatric medication and it’s the only thing outside of the emotional support from literally only one person in the world that’s keeping me alive. 

My doctors want to wean me off one of them, but I don’t want that. Initially I did as it was adversely effecting my memory, but now the dose is quite low and I don’t suffer memory loss. My psychiatrist had me on a dose that was way too much, but I had no idea about the memory loss until several years in. I didn’t know the dose was too much for me until much later. I just thought the anxiety has eased up and I’m more pleasant to be around. 

It isn’t my fault I was over medicated, I thought the doctor knew what he was doing and now that I’m not I want to be left alone about it. I’m too afraid I will end up worse than ever without the medication. How can I approach my doctor about this subject? And how in the world can I even begin to really address how I got here in the first place? 

I want to either get better or stop living, because I’ve lived with serious mental issues since I was a teenager and I’m tired. My thought processes feel wrong and really make me afraid for the future.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/122sfat/facebook_photos_of_me_after_my_dads_death_are/,t2_pn7t2swk,2023-03-27 00:58:47,2,1
How do you deal with an abusive relative?,"I am dealing with mild anxiety.

This relative of mine is not helping. She has become too emotionally and mentally draining for me.

Just 30 mins ago, she’s berating me over a menial thing. As in turning the lights off when I wake up. She even reached the point of verbally saying that she will kill me. I have become too disrespectful daw. She will kill me because I simply answered her with, “I just woke up.”

I cannot leave the house just yet.

I am trying my best to be strong for myself. If I let her break me, then what will become of me?

So, young adults of Reddit, how do you deal with erratic, verbally and physically abusive relative when you couldn’t leave their grasp just yet?",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/juuet0/how_do_you_deal_with_an_abusive_relative/,t2_8wkohibl,2020-11-16 05:56:05,2,5
My sister needs help,"This is going to be a long one but for anybody who reads this entire thing, thank you so much in advance. My sister (21) is in a dark place. We grew up in a nice neighborhood in the suburbs, parents divorced. Since she graduated high school in 2020 she hasn’t had a job and my mom gives her money, how much? I don’t know. My mom is afraid to take the keys to her car, take her phone. Last night she got extremely mad at me and broke something in my room, I lost my shit and told her to clean it up. Anyway she told my mom last night that she’s ready to end her life. This isn’t the first time she’s said something scary lately. My poor mom cannot make her do anything, she’s completely out of control. Completely. Absolutely. Out of control. She can’t make her get a job, she literally can’t make her do anything. I’ve told my mom in the beginning of all this (2020) that she needs her keys taken and be held accountable and get some responsibility. My mom payed for her to go to cosmetology school this year, she stopped going at week three.

I’m 24, I operate heavy equipment and drive tractor trailers. My dad whooped my ass growing up and I payed the prices for my bad decisions and mistakes. Nothing abusive whatsoever, but certainly physically punished lol. My dad instilled in me to grow the f*** up and figure it out. 

That’s the approach I want to take with my little sister but I know she’s so emotionally sensitive and obviously I love her and I don’t want anything to happen to her. I can’t just say “grow the f*** up. I’m taking your keys until we get you a job or you choose to go to school”. The only way I know how to deal with this is 1. Not the right way as it’s too late for that and 2. I’m her brother and she won’t take me seriously even if I did.
 
My mom is talking to my aunt who’s got knowledge in mental health issues as she’s been in that career for years. My mother is talking about sending her to a physc ward tonight and I KNOW it’s going to take the police to get her there. 

One thing to add as well, my mom has made appointments to see a therapist and she’s gone like twice, (nobody can make her go)

I agree with that decision but I’m worried about what’ll happen after. Will she get out, come home, and commit? Nobody in my family has gone to one of these and I know she’ll feel ashamed and embarrassed. Not many people in our family will know about this either. But I’m also afraid she’ll just leave home and commit or never talk to us again.

I guess I’m seeking for help and if anybody knows what to do and has been in this situation before I would absolutely love to hear what you guys think. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/1bl8mdu/my_sister_needs_help/,t2_hg8dqyii2,2024-03-23 04:02:17,0,1
I resent my parents/family,"I have Bipolar Disorder. There are times when memories are triggered and I simply can't help but to loathe my parents for:

1. Having this f@#$ng condition. I know this disease is genetically predisposed. Though they won't admit it, growing up I observed them having psychotic tendencies (ie irrational anger, anxiety attacks, pathological lying, violence towards us children).
I wish I never had them as parents!  I also think that there should be a strict policy that people should be assessed for psychological problems before procreating. Not all should be parents! And no one deserves to be in a family where mental illness could be passed off to offsprings. 

2. The physical, verbal and emotional abuse I suffered from them. They were whipping and beating the hell out of us when we were kids under the guise of 'godly discipline' and training up a child the way he should go. 
I hated them so much for this. I had bruises and bumps all over my body back then just bec of the petty things I did when I was young. I was whipped indiscriminately all over my body. I tried being whipped with a hanger, slipper, belt including the knuckle, bamboo stick, broom, dust pan, everything that my parents touch will be used to hurt me for the sake of discipline. I have been punched and kicked in private and public to embarrassed me in front of other people who didn't even help me. 
The physical bruises healed, but the emotional pain persists. 
When I was young I wanted so much to call Bantay Bata to be rescued. None of our relatives came to our aid. They allowed us to be treated that way and to live in such a dysfunctional family. The whipping and beating only stopped when I was first year high school, but the verbal abuse continued until in college. 

3. Being religious nuts/hypocrites. Their so called Christianity was forced upon me. I would be whipped if I don't go to church with them on Sundays. They would also not give me food back then. They manipulated me to do the salvation thing by accepting Jesus as my personal Lord and savior which I didn't understand yet when I was 10yo. They forced me to be baptized at 12yo. All they did is to make me attend their Church and do all those religious things. My father is a deacon, he participated in church activities and teach Sunday school. It's always in my mind how hypocritical they are. Saintly during Sundays from 9am to 5pm only, but a tyrant at home. 
One time I was having a feat Bec of my mood swings as bipolar, they restrained me and did an exorcism procedure!!! I was f@#$ng angry at them. They are so closed minded and didn't understand what I have. I have been called demonyita / diablo / anak ng demonyo. 
My mother said the condition that is happening to me is a challenge to the family and a work of the devil Bec my father is now teaching in Sunday School.  Arrrggghhhh!!!! I hate them

3. They always verbalize and made me feel that I am less of a person, not good enough, compared to other kids who are smarter, prettier etc. 
Growing up my mother will always tell me she had to give up her career to raise us and be a full time house wife. She blamed me particularly Bec I am the first born. I felt she blamed me bec she is miserable with her life. 
She is kinder and more loving to my brothers and cousins. She always made me feel that I am her least favorite person.

4. They were the reason my ex and I broke up. They were so strict to me,never allowed me to have a boyfriend. 
Pinagdamutan akong magmahal at magpakasal noong okay pa ako before ako madiagnosed. 
So I'm here stuck with them. I have Bipolar, unable to keep a job, still living with them though I wanted so much to leave.

Sana gumaling na ako, makatayo sa sarili Kong papa at maging independent sa kanila. 
Or mamatay na. Nauubos na Ang pag asa ko makalaya. 
I am embarrassed na nakatira pa rin ako sa kanila at Hindi ako masaya na kasama sila dahil sa trauma na binigay nila. 

Ako mismo Ang nagpadoktor sa sarili ko na may konting pag asang gumaling. 

My parents are more likely to do another exorcism on me than to seek professional medical help.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/ecaka4/i_resent_my_parentsfamily/,t2_57t4qfhu,2019-12-18 17:49:27,6,4
"Hello, is online therapy a thing in the PH?","I think I may have undiagnosed BPD. Matagal na to. I've lost so many people because I cant control my emotions. Yung highs and lows of BPD ramdam ko yon. I've been looking into it for around 4 years now pero student ako non at di ko afford magpatherapy.

Ang dami ko nang relasyon na nasira despite how much I care for the other person involved. Partners, friends, even my parents. I tend to be abusive verbally and physically and I really hate myself for it pero kapag galit ako lahat najjustify ko. 

I really wanna seek professional help kasi yung last partner ko sobrang pinagsisihan kong nagawa kong saktan. I want to be better for myself and my future partners. I've been planning to see a therapist mula nung magwork ako at afford ko na pero naiintimidate ako magpunta sa hospitals mag isa.

What is wrong with me?,"Hi, lately I didn’t feel so good. I mean there are phases in my life where I lay in bed for days without any motivation to do something. Yesterday I also had the feeling of throwing up and headaches after days of feeling overwhelmed and stressed. I keep reminding myself about things that happened in my life and feel irritated around or have splitted thoughts about people. I never know who to trust and if they want to do me wrong or good. I have childhood trauma and a bad relationship with my parents. They are very physically and verbally abusing to the point that I got panic attacks. I’ve also been forced into a psychiatry 2 times in my lifetime, because of anger issues and suicidal thougts. I feel like I could have some undiagnosed mental illnesses, because I don’t think that I’m normal. My reactions aren’t normal, they are impulsive and I’m too sensitive. Sometimes I feel like dying, because my emotions are so intense. I just want to shut everything completely off. I feel like I’m just existing and not really living my life, as if I lost so much of my time doing absolutely nothing. People who aren’t emotionally available or tend to hurt me are attracted by me and I can’t stop it. I tend to go towards people who make me feel like I’m unworthy of being loved. It is like a never ending circle. I’m attracted to men who don’t want to commit and it got me to that point where I feel sick and tired of it. I hate giving my all to people and never get it back. I wish some people would see how intense I am. I’m traumatized by people and needy and obsessive until it gets destructive. My grades are average, but I know I could do better. I hate when people compare myself with others. I could be so much better in school if my concentration problems just disappeared and if I had a safe place to study. When I was younger, I always enjoyed drawing, now it just feels like a burden to me, something that is so exhausting to do. Nothing interests me anymore, even though I want to explore and learn new things. Can’t read a book properly without traumatic scenes getting into my head again. Everytime I think it gets better, it goes downhill again. Why do I need to suffer sm? Why do I only have bad luck in life? Am I depressed? It feels weird for me to post this on here but I can’t help myself anymore. I’ve been bottling myself up for too long and just need to set my thoughts free for once.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/wakiov/what_is_wrong_with_me/,t2_p0y335lo,2022-07-29 04:33:52,4,6
I stopped writing. Here's my current progress.,"tw slurs

hi it's a throwaway account. also it's long :( 

------

I stopped writing.

I stopped writing about anything for like, 2 years ago. I lost track of my emotions and when I do write, I write in threads on Twitter and forget it again easily. I'm always invalidated growing up. Was emotionally abused by my best friend. I had controlling, conservative family that made me codependent; I can't do things to myself and that made me more insecure as they always keep on pointing it out. I learned household chores from my rebeldeng ate. Wala kaming alam sa buhay ng kuya ko (recently he's now married) and palaging pinagmamalaki ng ate ko sa'kin 'yun. Kasi nga, bunso ako, I spent my life studying until I graduate. I'm only 21 but I feel so useless and walang alam sa buhay. I can't help but compare with my classmate na spoiled na mas lalong walang alam to the point she can't turn on the stove pero bakit hindi siya insecured sa part na 'yun, bakit she's successful with her job? Bakit ok 'yung family niya? My friends are doing okay and also know to do things by themselves. Buti pa sila, they can handle jobs na I might fuck up. Mahirap maghanap ng trabaho in my field nang walang multiple skills (it's like 5 positions in one minimum salary) kaya most of my colleagues went to mediocre companies that took advantage of our skills.

Since high school I think I might have social anxiety disorder. It messed up my acads and nung nasa work na ako hindi na ako kinakabahan nang sobra + mabilis na ako mag-adjust kaya it's not much of a problem na. But before, they won't be able to understand I had two panic attacks, most especially my sister who was mad at me and said ""matanda ka na kailangan mong matututunang makipag-usap sa mga tao!"" I know it damn well. And minsan kapag ayaw kong kumausap sa phone for like deliveries they always say ""kailangan mong matuto"" I fucking know how because I had to, I just don't want to, and you made me feel stupid and insecure about it. 

I suspected I had ADHD when I randomly took a test online a year ago (self-diagnosis is bad, I know). I grew up being called ""autistic"" ""baliw"" ""monggoloid"" (they always use these words when they see a person acting weird) and that was an endearment by my relatives. I didn't mind when I was a kid but I'm getting more pissed now I know better. Like, why would you reduce a kid to a derogatory word? Tahimik lang ako nung maliit ako, and I don't want to be the center of attention and you called me names.

My parents are super strict. I wasn't allowed to be in a relationship until I graduated and nadala na ako when they're teasing me, idk nakakadiri nang pakinggan? I'm bi non-binary and they will be so disappointed if they knew I like girls too and I don't identify as their favorite girl. I'm so afraid lalo na my mom and sis believe so much and rely their decisions sa tarot cards and hula. They found something out because there was a clairvoyant who warned them a secret from me (he doesn't know a damn thing happening to me and i am a v private person!!!) and it's still traumatizing to me to the point I don't share so much information about me to my family anymore. Nasanay na akong tahimik lang sa kanila. I became a grey rock. I finished college para patunayan sa kanila na hindi ako katulad ng iniisip nila. And now I graduated, what now? If I moved out, they'll rely on hula and cards to know what I am up to. Mabuti pa manghuhula, pinaniniwalaan nila, anak nila, hindi 👁️👄👁️ 🙂👍

Tumatanda na ang mga magulang ko. And still, in this pandemic, I can't go out and work in a corporate setting that I may risk my immunocompromised family. I can't freelance using my laptop. Madalas ko rin alagaan ang pamangkin kong sobrang kulit, kaming apat ganito ang cycle everyday. I sleep all day and be awake all night. Ayokong magkaanak because naranasan ko na how to handle a child growing up and he's just 2 years old. I don't want that I might traumatize a child when I'm not okay myself. Sana alam ng mga susunod na parents na they should be financially and emotionally stable before they bring a child in this world. And sana hindi na ako matawag na ""tanga mo naman sino ba mag-aalaga sa'yo pagtanda?"" Sobrang outdated ng thinking ng family ko. They're still homophobic, ableist, entitled, mysogynists, chismoso/a who always degrade and backstab their acquaintances and I don't want to live that kind of life.

Actually, I'm doing fine than my highschool/college self. But I wish I had the help I needed back then and not be invalidated. I'm much more talkative, outgoing and having fun when I got out of my comfort zone with extroverts in college and I'm never been more grateful for them. :-) but busy na sila sa kani-kanilang buhay :-(

My plans in the future, when things get better:

-move out and learn things on my own.
I don't know how to wash and fold clothes (I always forgot how to uniformly fold it) and iron it (we don't have one). I guess 'yun na lang + cook more food!

-get a diagnosis. I tried a mh service online but I can't even tell the volunteer what my problem is. At least in this post I was able to get it off my chest.

-take psych. But I have to be better first.

-earn money for myself and myself only. Magbibigay sa fam when I want to.

-be more open to my family once I'll get better.

-cut ties with my emotionally abusive best friend.

-give my cats a better life.

-be unapologetic and forgive myself.

Unrequited love,"(I’m kano so sorry this is all in English, I’m trying to learn Tagalog again but this vent will just be in English)

I’m 22F, I live in US, I moved out from my family home 4 years ago. That’s also when I met him, let’s call him LB. 

We’ve been friends this whole time but this past year, we’ve been FWB. He’s so fantastic, I really can’t over estimate it. He’s calm, level headed, patient, emotionally mature, an amazing listener and gives the best advice too. He can talk to anyone and make anyone laugh. When he’s at a party, I think he’s the life of the party. 

I love the version of myself when I’m with him. I feel so safe because I know he would never judge me, or anyone. I feel like a teenager all over again, but in a good way. 

I know our FWBship is going to end soon because I’m moving to a new city. I also know we’re both too busy for a relationship, much less a long distance relationship.

I just hope that when we’re apart, that he doesn’t cross paths with an abuser. The sweetest people have a tendency to attract the nastiest people. I don’t want anyone to take his light away. Hopefully, he’ll be in good hands. Alone or with a different woman, I just want a future of happiness for him. He’ll always have a special place in my heart.

Thank you for reading.

Emotionally Immature Father Accuses the Family of Teaming Up Against Him,"At first, I thought of my father as a typical short-tempered dad. He doesn't open his mouth unless it is about his interests, or when upset about something. But as I grew older, I realized that he was simply emotionally immature.

The rest of the family would behave ourselves in the way he'd like. Mind you, all of my siblings are now college students. He doesn't like it when we leave the toilet seat closed. He doesn't like it when the bathroom floor is wet (despite having someone recently using the shower). He doesn't like it when his belongings are not within eyesight (absolutely do not hide them inside a simple cabinet). He doesn't like it when we eat using our fingers when eating fish or shrimp. He doesn't like it when the window screens are closed and he's feeling hot despite the mosquitoes that bite us at night. It also leaves the house very dusty, and we'd have to clean it a lot more.

He doesn't help us clean the house at all, and his assistance can only be needed when it's really really important. He doesn't clean his dishes nor is even bothered to leave them in the sink. But he gets upset when he needs to use the sink to brush his teeth and he sees that there are dirty dishes. He never admits his mistakes, and when we point it out, he gets really upset. But when *we* make a mistake, he makes a *huge* deal out of it.

We consistently walk on eggshells in the house just to prevent him from getting upset. He doesn't physically hurt us, but he is just utterly hard to live with. I'm not even allowed to watch things he doesn't approve of at home: LGBT shows, Filipino teleseryes, sexual or violent content, or even shows that don't make sense (he calls these shows where you don't think is for bobo), Kdramas or Japanese anime where he doesn't understand what they're speaking.

With all of these things in mind, the rest of the family is much closer to each other than to him. One time, we watched a comedy movie in the bedroom without him. My sibling was laughing so hard, and my mother told them to quiet it down because my father might hear us. You have no idea how much it hurts me. Are we not allowed to experience joy without him? and are we not allowed to simply laugh out loud despite how ""unacceptable"" he thinks the way that we laugh is?

This brings me to the reason why I wrote this post. He accuses us of teaming up against him. He gets upset because we try to console each other after his angry verbally abusive outbursts (he doesn't say profanities, but his words are still as sharp as a knife). He gets upset when we have fun activities without him. How could we not...? It's extremely hard to please him.

I just really want to let my feelings out here. Are there other people who experience family dynamics like this? If so, how do you cope?

Anyone else having a bad mothers'day??,"I have legit mommy issues 🤣 so mothers' day can be very triggering to me. My mother was part of the reason I have trust and abandonment issues. She would ~borrow my hard earned salary without my knowledge (sa ATM nya kasi pumapasok), sometimes she would ask relatives for money for me daw, kahit Im funding myself naman entirely through college.

She was also emotionally absent and abusive. Her most famous lines were ""I'm your mother, not your friend"" and ""If you don't do ----, aalis ako"". There's ofc the filipino mom's body shaming trademark. Most damaging piece of advice from her was to consider na maybe I'm the bad guy, instead of always transferring schools and playing victim because I was bullied as a child. Naranasan ko naman na masampal at mapalo, pretty normal, but sometimes she would let me starve din when I upset her. I thought that was normal din until I told other people about it haha

Given >1yr na akong nandito sa bahay with her bc of covid, it's even worse. At least dati, naiiwasan ko to... Ngayon wala talaga.

Undiagnosed.,"[I'm 15 and I badly want to have an access to a mental health professional since I've been extremely related with every symptom/sign, in the likes of BPD and ADHD comorbidity, but I don't know how I will have.]


I prefer to keep my name private. Call me Paul.

Lumaki ako sa Lolo at Lola ko, my mother gave birth at me at the age of nineteen, she didn't finished her first college course because of the pregnancy. 11 months after I was born, I had a brother and they have to give me to my grandparents since they really are not that economically and mentally stable at that time and my grandparents live in such an above stable living.

I have been there for nine years, it was a conservative household, and I was eight when I discovered I'm not a straight boy. I have always hidden it, my queer identity has always been suppressed inside. For 5 years, I studied in a Christian school which caused me to suppress my sexuality more. There were jokes of disownments kasi rin, kaya sobrang natakot ako.

When I came back to my parents at the age of ten, my Mom already finished her college and has been practice teaching (her course is Education). I was so naïve, 'di ko alam kung anong ieexpect ko sa mga magulang ko, since hindi naman kami ganoon ka-close.

That's when I've experienced kung paano yung feeling ng na sa laylayan. We lived in an impoverished community, squatter ba kung tawagin. At that time, dalawa na yung nakababata kong kapatid.

It was a violent and extreme household, mom knew I was gay, and she really doesn't care, my Dad too, except that he always use his ""tolerance"" against me.

Linggo-linggo, palaging away, not only verbally but also physically. I think it was 2016, where it really peaked, yung violence sa household, yung pisikalan, yung siraan ng gamit sa bahay, basagan ng plato, baliktarin ng mesa sa hapag, and even pagbabato ng mga gamit at damit sa labas ng bahay. The anger issues of my father made my Mom emotionally dismissive and extreme to us as well. At that time, yung laging na sa isip ko, paano nakakayanan ng nanay ko yung ganoon. Not only the abuse, but the quality of life that our father has given to us. Linggo-linggo mangungutang sa kapitbahay, sa mga kamag-anak, tsismis doon, tsismis dito.

It was a very extreme environment, na I wasn't even able to pity myself anymore, but to pity my two younger brothers and a year after that, our youngest brother was born. He also got to somehow, shortly sought the unhealthiness of our family.

Last year, my Mom and Dad separated, because my Mom's family urged her to let go of the 16-year old toxic relationship they had, since it got to a point where there have been death threats and threats of our personal things getting destroyed and thrown.

After that, my grandfather disowned me as well because of finally outing myself as a queer.

From Mandaluyong, we transferred to Tarlac.

My Mom is still now a teacher in Mandaluyong, since it's really not an easy least process to transfer, but I'm really glad that we have been in an economically stable place now, a thing that we didn't have when we were our father.

I'm currently taking care of my brother full-time, until face-to-face classes go back, and it's very mentally tiring as well.

Since hindi naman sila kasal, the conjugation was never addressed properly.

Four months ago, we found out that my five-year old brother has an ADHD.

I don't really know if it is because of the environment we had, but he's yet to have his therapy.

Maybe what I'm experiencing right now is a traumatic response, since I assure you that everything was just so mentally scarring. The gaslight, abuse and narcissism I have been fazed into was never great.

Every day is emotionally painful, draining, and so hard to cope, there's this constant fear of abandonment, impulsive (sexual) behaviors, self-harm, the inability to build up stable relationships and friendships, violent mood swings and a never-ending struggle with self-image.

Me and my brother share absolute the same page when it comes to inability to focus and be firm and stable,.and to habe extreme racing thoughts, differing that I just have violent and detrimental ones.

Even though we're in an economically stable place now, my mind still re-operates in my past.

Suicidal ideation has been a part of the everyday struggle.

I'm the one who got frustrated with my Psychiatrists/Psychologists. A more detailed post on why,"I posted the thread below a day ago and some might assume I only had 1 session with these mental health professionals. I had my first session last January 2022, and the longest I've been with a mental health professional is 8 months, no improvement. I'd like to share my experience with past MH professionals and why I'm so damn frustrated. I don't really care if no one reads this but I feel like I need to vent.

Psychologist 1 - *4 sessions for almost 2 months*

* I think this is the only psychologist in the province I lived in before (or the only one I could search anyway). Lots of red flags in the first meeting. I told her I was agnostic and she told me she understands but hopes I would see that a god exists. Asked my salary and told me to invest it in the place she was investing her money (won't mention where). I didn't say my true salary and straight up wanted to leave. Told me to definitely not take medication. The last straw was when I told her I was sexually assaulted as a kid and she told me I was still lucky I wasn't r4ped. That that must be why I was stable(??) because I wasn't r4ped. Told her that's not luck, that should be the norm. And thinking that way is enabling the future generation to normalize r4pe. I didn't go to another psychologist until a year later because I was afraid all psychologists were like that but it was probably just the culture in my province where everyone has no boundaries and imposes their religious beliefs on a daily basis. I shouldn't have expected a lot for 500php/hr anyway.

Psychologist 2 - *Probably 5 sessions over the course of a few months. I forgot because I wasn't the consistent*

* Online consultations. Kind of liked her but there were times I didn't (I think those were the times I was splitting. Should have been a sign I had BorderlinePD). I just remembered she was the one who told me to consider if I had bipolar disorder. Didn't go back because I felt F2F consults were better because I was already at my apartment 24/7 (I WFH).

Psychiatrist 1 - *8 months. Once or twice a month*

* Initally diagnosed me with MDD and PTSD (I agree with the PTSD). I waited for the meds to take effect for months but constantly said I didn't feel anything changing. I told my family history (bio dad is diagnosed psychopath, grandfather has hallucinations and paranoia relating to hallucinations and is also violent, half-sister is neurodivergent. they never got any medical help btw even with those diagnosis) but was not diagnosed with anything else. I also told her I had violent tendencies (when I was alone) like thrashing my stuff and daydreamed about ways to harm people and how they could die (this was for people who've harmed me. I acknowledge that's not a good reason to wish ill of them). I get angry at the smallest things and would cut people off when they said one thing I didn't like. This was true even on meds. I also said a whole host of symptoms that I now know are symptoms of BorderlinePD but I don't think she took me seriously. She prescribed me a medication (still for MDD I think) that she said was addictive and I said that might be a problem because I have substance abuse issues. She told me to just control my dosage. That's not how addiction works. There were times where nagchchika nalang siya sa sessions about things I think didn't relate to my mental health anymore. Treatment plan never changed even though I constantly said I still feel the same. Just upped my dosage to the max possible for MDD. After 8 months, I didn't think I could spend any more money with no improvement. I don't think she's a bad psych but I guess just not the right fit for me and my mental disorders. I just stopped my meds cold turkey and didn't feel any changes or withdrawal symptoms, so I can probably say it didn't have any effect on me.

Psychiatrist 2 - *1 session*

* Prescribed valproic acid which aggregates PCOS and alters thyroid function. Asked if I should get myself checked first because I didn't know if I had PCOS or abnormal thyroid hormone levels and had no way to know about family's medical history but she just said to not worry lalo na I'm still young. I still got myself checked and just didn't go back kasi I wanted F2F na.

Psychiatrist 3 - *Will have my 2nd session this week.*

Now, I've looked forward to getting mental help as early as elementary. I spent a few years living in a domestically violent household, and spent the next decade living in between relatives who weren't physically abusive, but were verbally abusive and neglected me to the point where a lot of times I didn't have food and no one took care of me when I got sick (no meds, no food). I self-supported myself to finish college so finances have always been tight. A lot of times I wanted to kill myself. A lot of times I hurt myself. I stuck it out because I always told myself everything would be better once I'm financially stable and able to get help. I spent the first few years working multiple part-time jobs on top of my full-time job to save up. I was really excited to finally get some mental health help and now I'm just frustrated I'm not making any progress. I've finally got some sort of financial stability (the thing I said would make me happy) and I just feel nothing. Everything that happened to me finally caught up to me and I'm feeling the anger, sadness and resentment all at once. I don't have constant emotional support so I was betting my life on psychotherapy and meds saving me. I do try to function every day. I work, go to the gym, try to eat right, pay my bills on time, etc. I struggle to get up every day, but I do try. But when I don't have work I just cry and binge eat and think about dying. I'm 26 now, but I feel like I've lived 50 years. I don't think I can live the rest of my life like this.

I think I'll be booking a session with Doc Mariano. She's out of my price range but I heard she's the best. And I think I need the best for me to even have a shot at getting better.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/17c3fa2/im_the_one_who_got_frustrated_with_my/,t2_l0bssk5da,2023-10-20 13:10:50,4,3
What is the importance of mental health awareness?,"Mental health awareness has gained significant recognition in recent years, shedding light on an issue that was once shrouded in stigma and silence. It is a topic that has become increasingly important in our fast-paced, modern world, where stress, anxiety, and depression are prevalent. This article explores the significance of mental health awareness, its impact on individuals and society, and the steps we can take to promote a healthier and more compassionate approach to mental well-being.

**Reducing Stigma**

One of the most crucial aspects of mental health awareness is its ability to combat the stigma surrounding mental illnesses. For decades, mental health issues were often seen as a sign of weakness or something to be hidden. This stigma prevented many individuals from seeking help when they needed it, leading to untreated mental health conditions and their potential to worsen.

By promoting awareness, we can challenge these harmful stereotypes and misconceptions. It helps people understand that mental health problems are not a personal failing but a common and treatable aspect of the human experience. This change in perception encourages those who are suffering to reach out for support without fear of judgment or discrimination.

**Early Intervention and Treatment**

Mental health awareness plays a vital role in early intervention and treatment. When individuals and their loved ones are more informed about the signs and symptoms of mental health conditions, they are better equipped to recognize when someone may be struggling. Early identification allows for prompt intervention, reducing the severity and duration of the illness.

Moreover, increased awareness empowers individuals to seek help for themselves. It encourages a proactive approach to mental well-being, where people are more likely to access professional treatment and support when they recognize the need. Early intervention not only improves individual outcomes but also reduces the overall burden on the healthcare system.

**Improved Overall Health**

Mental health is closely interconnected with physical health. Mental health conditions can have a profound impact on an individual's physical well-being, leading to increased risk factors for chronic diseases, substance abuse, and a compromised immune system. Furthermore, stress and anxiety can manifest physically, contributing to issues such as high blood pressure and heart disease.

By promoting mental health awareness, we emphasize the importance of holistic well-being. Encouraging regular check-ins with mental health professionals and fostering self-care practices can lead to better overall health outcomes. When people prioritize their mental health, they are more likely to engage in healthy behaviors, maintain social connections, and manage stress effectively.

**Productivity and Workplace Well-being**

Mental health awareness is not confined to the personal sphere; it has significant implications for the workplace as well. The modern work environment often places immense pressure on employees, leading to stress, burnout, and decreased productivity. When employers prioritize mental health awareness and create supportive workplace cultures, the benefits are far-reaching.

Promoting mental well-being in the workplace not only enhances employee morale but also boosts productivity and creativity. It reduces absenteeism and turnover rates, leading to cost savings for organizations. Moreover, employees are more likely to feel valued and supported, leading to higher job satisfaction and a better work-life balance.

**Stronger Communities**

A society that fosters mental health awareness is one that values the well-being of its members. When individuals are educated about mental health and its challenges, they are more likely to reach out to friends, family, and community resources when someone is struggling. This creates a network of support that can make a significant difference in someone's recovery journey.

Strong communities also reduce feelings of isolation and loneliness, which are common experiences for individuals with mental health conditions. By promoting open and empathetic conversations about mental health, we create spaces where people can connect and share their experiences, ultimately building a sense of belonging and solidarity.

**Suicide Prevention**

Mental health awareness is a key component of suicide prevention. Many individuals who contemplate suicide are dealing with untreated or undiagnosed mental health conditions. Raising awareness about the signs of suicidal ideation and providing resources for intervention can save lives.

When society is more attuned to mental health issues, it becomes easier to identify when someone may be in crisis. Friends, family members, and colleagues can step in to offer support or connect the individual to professional help. Additionally, public awareness campaigns can reduce the stigma associated with suicide, making it more acceptable for individuals to seek help when they are struggling with suicidal thoughts.

**Resilience and Coping Skills**

Mental health awareness equips individuals with the knowledge and skills needed to build resilience and cope with life's challenges. Understanding that it is okay to seek help and engage in self-care practices promotes emotional well-being.

Education about mental health also provides people with tools to manage stress, anxiety, and difficult emotions effectively. When individuals have access to coping strategies and resources, they are better equipped to navigate life's ups and downs without succumbing to the negative effects of untreated mental health conditions.

**Policy and Advocacy**

Mental health awareness plays a crucial role in shaping public policy and advocacy efforts. When a society is informed about the prevalence and impact of mental health issues, there is greater pressure on governments and institutions to allocate resources for mental health services. Advocacy groups and individuals can push for policy changes that prioritize mental health and expand access to care.

The importance of mental health awareness cannot be overstated. It is a fundamental aspect of creating a compassionate, supportive, and healthy society. By reducing stigma, promoting early intervention and treatment, improving overall health outcomes, enhancing workplace well-being, fostering stronger communities, preventing suicide, building resilience, and driving policy changes, mental health awareness brings about a positive ripple effect that benefits us all. As we continue to prioritize mental health in our lives and communities, we move closer to a world where everyone has the opportunity to thrive emotionally and mentally.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/16c3psg/what_is_the_importance_of_mental_health_awareness/,t2_g13g4k1ez,2023-09-07 10:22:45,1,3
I have anger issues,"So, I finally snapped. Finally experienced the strain that broke the camel's back.

I got in a shouting match with my dad and being the stellar narcissistic abuser he is, projected his faults on to me, called me names, swore at me and etc.
Afterwards, when I realized I was an idiot for getting myself into this mess and went quiet, he kept coming back to gloat in my face, goading how I'm full of crap and I should sit my ass down as a woman and don't ever cross him because he's a man and he can do a lot worse than just a slap.

And yes, to paraphrase our 1 hr fight, that's basically what he said. 

I really really want to get back, in the most damaging way possible but I know I shouldn't. I have my lola, my younger siblings to think about... but I just have so much RAGE in me its so hard to control now. I slip up once and look where it got me. These last few months have been testing me and since my cat died, I've had difficulty managing my emotions.

I have been thinking on therapy for a long time now but under this house, with these people, its difficult. Mental illness is a phase and the human psychology is a myth according to them. I've been planning to move out for a few months now and get therapy then but now that its come to this — me getting hissy over the smallest things, I think its time to finally seek therapy out. Problem is, I'm not sure where to start.

If anyone has any advice or a resouce, I'd really appreciate it. Thank you.

Edit 1: I just wanted to add that if I could move out, I would already have. Believe me, I would. But my lolo was hospitalized in Feb and we racked up a bill of 500k and then my cat got sick shortly after my lolo was admitted. My lola and family were already doing everything they can to find money to pay so on top of the hosp bills, I helped out a bit on house bills and grocery and fully soloed my cat's vet bills. My modest savings really dwindled. 

And its not just myself that wants to leave. My sister has clinical depression, diagnosed since she was 15. I can't leave her here. So we're working hard to earn enough to move out together with our only remaining cat, Siopao (si bunso nagpangalan sa kanya lol, she was 4 at the time).",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/uoduf7/i_have_anger_issues/,t2_9vld12dk,2022-05-13 07:08:09,13,17
I think my boyfriend has Depression but he isn't diagnosed yet,"So my boyfriend lives in a kinda toxic household. His dad married his mom when she was 18 and the father's 23 in order for the mother to escape from her family's abuse but guess what? My boyfriend's father have cheated on her twice with a 13 year old and with another girl whom we do not know. My boyfriend's father fatshames my boyfriend's sister, believes in toxic masculinity, is mad whenever he sees my bf crying, threatens to make him angrier/sadder if he doesn't tell him what's wrong, etc. In short, he's like that typical father from the 50's or so xD. My boyfriend's mom haven't finished her education because her husband doesn't want to and she acts naive and agrees with whatever fuckery he says otherwise he might kill their children (he choked my bf when he was a kid because he disobeyed and stuff and he almost died from it). My boyfriend is introverted and was late diagnosed with ADHD probably when he was 13 and he also told me that he always feels empty, no emotions, and just overthinking shits inside his head. I feel so bad for him and idk how to help him out. He wanted to go to therapy but he's a minor and his parents will certainly not allow him to. The father doesn't believe in mental illnesses also doesn't take his kids to hospitals and stuff when they think they're sick because he's a strong believer of placebo effect.. so yea.. help pls hshxhhhshshdh",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/owya7y/i_think_my_boyfriend_has_depression_but_he_isnt/,t2_722lw47a,2021-08-03 15:20:05,2,4
life coach invalidated my BPD,"Lil background. I knew I was depressed for years but never got myself diagnosed because I feared it would be expensive. Mostly coped thanks to my ex, but after more than 7 years together and living together, we broke up in June 2021. A month later, I attempted to hurt myself but stopped myself and asked my boss then for help. He found me a hotline called Tawag Paglaum, and they directed me to VSMMC Behavioral Sciences Center because they had free outpatient psychiatric services. I was able to talk to a psychiatrist 10 days later, was diagnosed with major depression, and was prescribed escitalopram and risperidone. The meds were free too, although the hospital would frequently run out.

Four months later, I realized that the meds weren't working. I was also able to talk to another psychiatrist who diagnosed me with bipolar disorder. Since my original psychiatrist was her coworker, she told him I should taper off my current meds and switch to a mood stabilizer. A month later, my s-thoughts got so bad that I decided to quit my job and move back in with my family. This was a major decision because I had moved out to escape my emotionally abusive dad. Thankfully, my tita offered to let me stay with her in her apartment in Davao rent-free. It would also be a great opportunity to look for a new job.

Or so I thought. I've learned that a) Cebu is a much nicer city, and b) my tita doesn't really believe in mental health. She even forbade me from seeking further medication. For the first two weeks here, s-thoughts became a daily horrorshow in my head. During one particularly bad afternoon, I called my cousin who referred me to a good friend of hers who was also a psychiatrist at VSMMC-BSC. This time, I was finally given my most accurate diagnosis yet: borderline personality disorder. It really explains why I was the way I was in my previous relationship. I was also given a pdf of Matthew McKay's DBT skills workbook. I haven't gotten around to reading it yet. I want to look for a psychiatrist here in Davao who could help me do it and maybe prescribe a mood stabilizer as well, but no dough.

So! My main point. Haha. My tita recently paired me up with a ""therapist,"" and today I learned that she's actually a life coach. Said life coach told me that while she's not saying the doctors were wrong about me, she wants me to think of my disorder as a ""belief"" that I could eventually get rid of. I endured the two-and-a-half hour session and told my tita it wasn't for me, but she still wants me to give it a thought, i.e., to go through with it.

I don't know what to do. Refusing the life coaching would likely put a strain on my relationship with my tita, but I'm already grappling with my immediate family's cynicism—I can't deal with one more thing that invalidates my experiences. But I don't really have anywhere else to go. So is it something that I should just stomach? Learn to live with? Can my BPD really be willed away?",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/s8jrtd/life_coach_invalidated_my_bpd/,t2_26q3przc,2022-01-20 22:06:48,18,6

I request advice for overcoming my specific stress and depression issue,"I am more often than not feeling like on a emotional rollercoaster. But not alternating from highs and lows. It feels like being nervous. The nervousness is gigantic. My stress levels are usually extremely high. Higher than what most normal people would experience in a lifetime, so it's hard for me to be understood. It's mentally blinding.

I've been stuck in a cycle of sleep-deprivation for 3+ years. I can't sleep at night deliberately since I'm too stressed to do that. Usually I get knocked out involuntarily very late and sleep a little.

This doesn't sound very hard. But for you to understand why it's hard, I've been physically and mentally ill in other ways (including in excruciatingly painful and disabling ways that make me much different from a normal person), living in a abusive environment daily, and in a crisis to not stay stuck this way indefinitely so I can exit my abuse and not become too old to do what I want in my future. The latter is a legit concern since there's limited time to begin it.

I've been silently screaming within for years. This HASN'T been deliberate. I really don't will this and want it to stop. It feels just like screaming but inaudible.
 
I'm a courageous person and was before the initial injury of bad luck which started the catastrophic combination of my ""arduous life situation"". I could consistently stifle my fears and act with discipline to take strategically-calculated bets. I put so much effort into describing why it's difficult so you don't misunderstand it as an issue of cowardice. What I feel is beyond fear, it's a agonizing muddle of insanity, while exhausted by sleep-deprivation and afflicted by all the other stuff. 

The thing that upsets me the most is my injustices. At some point I feel like just raging and not being patient. I could try to have discipline but feel an extreme aversion to it. Another reason why I want to get cured so badly is to return to take revenge. I would be able to do it since I'd have the exalted health. 

I also have disgusting insanities, my name for a type of insanity that I just have to look away from. An example of one is suddenly imagining my face covered by cockaroaches. There's ones unsuitable to mention publicly. It's like a nightmare grips me with compulsion and I have to break free with my mind. Not as a healthy sharp person, but somone ill and exhausted and already constantly screaming.

Doing trivial tasks such as hygiene and exercise and healthy eatting are very strainful for me. And even dangerous due to my injuries. So, I've lacked such things. Recently though, I've been better at them.

I need to fix my health issues one by one. And the top priority one is the sleep. So, I request advice on how to be able to consistently sleep early and deliberately. Not typical advice like ""wake up at the same time every day"" or ""spend some time without a screen to wind down before bed"". Advice like that isn't heavy-duty enough. I need a plan to extremely lower my stress. This isn't like any normal stressful event at school or work or sleeping issue. This is a health crisis where light methods of destressing aren't enough.

My peril is that I could stay stuck repeatedly suffering new injustices and injuries, miss out on what I want to do most in my life in the future, and never get vengeance. I must maximally stress to save myself from that.

"Hello, so akala ko ""katamaran"" at ""lack of discipline"" lang ang nangyayari sakin these past few months...","Siguro ang nasa isip ko lang ngayon: **pagod na ako.**

Background story lang, siguro sobrang napagod ako dahil ang daming obligations (being the eldest), helping my father with his family business, surviving emotional & verbal abuse from my mom, slowly accepting..... moving on from how my ex treated me. Parang and bigat, gusto ko nalang umiyak.  Simula college hanggang sa pag-graduate ko, we dealt with my mom's violence and abandonment. Yung aftermath nun, nagsuffer kami financially, na-apektuhan din negosyo namin pati relationships namin sa close relatives, friends and employees.

&#x200B;

I tried to open up how I'm feeling with my dad pero ang sinabi lang niya sa akin ""ano ba iccomplain mo, ang ibang tao walang makain..."" o kaya "" so tatanggapin mo nalang na ganyan ka na?""

&#x200B;

Naiintindihan ko yung sinabi ng tatay ko. It''s just really in my mind. That it starts with me... kung paano ko aalagaan sarili ko. So I did.  Gumawa ako ng routine, pero ngayon bumabalik na naman. Lately nas-stress lang ako kasi yung tatay ko parang hindi narrealize na maybe he needs to stop this business kasi hindi na healthy sa amin at pangalawa mas nauuna na ang company kesa sa kailangan ng pamilya. In short -- wala kaming savings. At dun ako na-aalarma. 22 palang ako, wala pa akong enough savings, paano na family ko?

Kaya nagstart ako maghanap ng ibang trabaho, kasi dapat may second source kami ng income. At yun naman ang mahirap kasi attached na ako sa company at yung expectations ng employees namin saakin eh maasahan ako. Kasi napaka-go getter ko talagang tao. I established myself already in the company as someone who can walk the talk and hindi lang anak ng boss.

Ngayon ko lang na-realize na hindi pala ako okay. Hindi pala ako normal. Thankful nalang ako I chose to step out of my bad habits. Pero yun nga, isang buwan ata akong hindi kumakain consistently, hindi naglilinis, basta sobrang baba ng self-care. Akala ko katamaran ko lang yun, that's why mas naging intense pa yung galit ko sa sarili ko kasi I coudln't do things right..

&#x200B;

Then it hit me, **kailangan ko talaga mag-pahinga.**

&#x200B;

Naisip ko na before magpa-therapy.. kasi yung sister ko rin kasi na-apektuhan. Pero since short nga sa money, I volunteered na maging patient for psych students. Then sinabi nila may PTSD daw ako.

Last,"Hi. I would just like to leave my receipt here. Because I know of all people, you guys will understand.

I'm 22 years old, on my last semester in college.

My boyfriend of 4 years broke up with me almost 3 weeks ago. My brother who is my favorite person in the world got home from Japan last month after 2 years but he had to go back to Japan to finish his PhD studies. My boyfriend left me the moment my brother had to go back to Japan. Now, I recently found out that my boyfriend was actually cheating on me for months now. It's sad because he knows all about my depression and trauma yet he chose to break me even further. I live with verbally, emotionally and physically abusive parents, and my sister who's also with us inherited my parents' toxic traits. I have a low self-esteem and I have never opened up to anyone but my boyfriend who I trusted so much, until he broke that trust. I was never allowed to speak up in my home. Whenever I express my feelings, they would usually use it against me or slap me across the face. There's also this one time when my mom continuously smashed my head on the floor because I asked her if we could talk nicely about the problem. I have great circles of friends but I never tell them any of my problems. I hate myself, and I am aware of how much I need to learn about self-love. But I always put others before myself. And I liked keeping it that way.

I've been stuck at home since the pandemic and my mental health has been worst. I was forced to study in a toxic environment. I only have my thesis defense coming up now, but I know I'll fail it because it's difficult for me to focus since I just went through a rough time. I study Chemistry, which was something I used to love, now it only exhausts me.

I've been suicidal since I was 13. I survived through writing, but now that I'm in college, I failed to put my thoughts in paper, so I'm bottling it all up. I have failed to seek professional help because I couldn't afford it, while free consultations were too much of a hassle for me.

I see no future ahead of me. What kept me going were my pets, my 12-year-old dog Miley, and thinking about how my friends would feel if they find out I'm gone.

But I've had enough. I want to think of myself now. I've been strong enough, it's just time for me to rest now. My boyfriend delivered the final blow. But this is not his fault. This is mine because it's my choice. Thank you for reading up to here. I hope you remember my story.

Goodbye.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/uq2dl3/last/,t2_ibylsxft,2022-05-15 17:23:12,5,7
Reflecting on toxic elementary school days and invalidation.,"After reflecting on my childhood experiences for a while, I've decided to finally share some of my thoughts here.

I believe the trauma I suffered in my toxic Catholic school contributed greatly to my current mental state. I was never allowed to socialize with non-relatives before, so imagine how well I coped with being thrown into a room full of fifty kids that I barely knew. I had a bully in every class I was in, and no friends to talk to during my free time. All I ever did was daydream and disassociate, thus resulting in my terrible work ethic and inability to submit assignments.

One of the things I hated most about school was being made fun of because I never had any crushes in school. You know, ""Diba abnormal ka daw kapag wala kang crush?"". One of my teachers even joined in the bullying, which only made things worse. The funny thing is when I did get a crush for the first time in college, I ended up becoming a horribly abnormal and toxic person to them.

I recently revisited these memories and realized that I developed BPD partly because of the constant isolation and invalidation of my emotions. There were TONS of signs that I wasn't doing well emotionally in school, however my parents chose to be in denial or come up with a short-sighted solution. Apparently, transferring me to a public school wasn't an option because the prestige would be lost.

Another realization I had was that (some) teachers can be toxic as hell. I noticed that a lot of them acted more like drill sergeants than elementary school teachers and placed too many unnecessary expectations on their students, such as not moving AT ALL during mass. I personally think one of the reasons why mental illness has become prevalent nowadays is because a lot of teachers during the early to mid-2000's were like this. Since corporal punishment was abolished and being discouraged, a lot of them resorted to mental and verbal abuse for the sake of discipline. I'm happy that teachers are now being encouraged to view their students as people with individual needs and behaviors, but I think things won't get better unless colleges of Education begin teaching their pre-service teachers how to cope with stressful situations in the classroom and not take their anger out on children. Unfortunately, most of them tend to focus more on memorizing theories than discussing how to actually apply them in the classroom.

Has anyone here had similar experiences? How did your own school days impact your mental health? How should teachers better address their students' emotional needs nowadays?",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/9dkntn/reflecting_on_toxic_elementary_school_days_and/,t2_1qz7vrel,2018-09-07 01:06:15,5,2
Help please po,"Ok. If you're gonna check my past post. I've been everywhere dito sa reddit, trying to make sense of it all. Trying to call out for help , sharing my story and my rants pero it all fell on deaf ears. Di ko alam. Di ko alam bakit. Depressed ako matagal na actually but I was like a functioning depressed person, I'm able to go to work, do my job, established ""friendships"" and Connections with other people. I even had hobbies like drinking and playing video games, I love food. I'm diabetic but I love the feeling of being full and content. I'm married, been married for 20 years now she a good responsible wife pero I cheated her a couple of times, it's not about love it's just about the excitement it brings. Even my playmates are cheaters too. Wither they're married or in a stable relationship or may mga suitors but they're not that aggressive daw. Everyone wants to be fucked hard, sabi nga noong Isa, but don't want the complications attached to it. My relationship with my family , dad and mom.. to be honest was purely kaplastikan, specially sa Mon ko. Why you ask? Because I was abused by these fuckers as I was growing up emotionally, mentally, verbally and corporal punishment and humiliation is their only solution. They feed you , they give you a roof over your head but if you don't perform in a certain way, you're a 1orthless piece of shit. The insults comes, the comparison between you and other people becomes intense, then it depends who pero the physical pain is next, the slapping, the punching, the kicking, the spitting in your face. I use to think of it as normal. Na it's my fault. So I hid the scars, hid the pain. When my dad was about to die.. he smacked me over the face with a crystal ashtrays. Over sa 2 pisong sukli.. He apologize later and Akala ko dahil Mahal nya ako, pero Hindi pala. Dahil Kasi mahina na na sya, na malapit na sya mamatay, at kailangan nya ng alaga. When he died, turned into a slut bitch, ala pa Isang taon nakahanap na Ng kapalit ng ama ko na alang silbi, pinabayaan Ang negosyo iniwan ng ama ko, kaya naghihirap kami, Yung puro yabang at pag dodminnante nya sa akin pilit nya binabalik pero malaki na ako gaga. Di na uubra Ang mga pautot mo noon . Matigas na buto ko at ala ka na maooffer sa akin na worth it  nagtratrabaho ako noon, kumita ng Pera. Iba talaga pag may Pera ka, kahit anong basura mo noon, nagiiba dahil sa Pera. Di Naman ako naging suwail na anak pinilit ko ibalik Ang dating pagsasama namin ni mama, may share ako lagi sa expenses, pag linngo magpapaluto Ako ng ulam. Pero Ina talaga sapak ng ugali nya. Parang bi polar na ewan.
Basta pag ala syang pera. Lahat ng mabuting ugali nya nawawala at napapalitan nitong sakim na masungit na mayabang na Akala mo Alam lahat pero bobo Naman. Napaka judgemental pa sobra. Ingittera, na judgemental.
Ang tanging kakaiba is Yung kapatid ko. Minahal ko ng lubos yon ako panganay at alam ko Ang hirap na dadanasin nya sa kamay ng magulang ko. Ako Yung nagsilbing buffer.. between them.
Lumipas Ang panahon nagsarili na rin ako, lumayo nagasawa. Inamin ko may mga panahon di Ako nakakapunta sa nanay ko. Na ngayon pinagaral Ang kapatid ko.

Pag may Pera o special na occasion nag binigay ako. Never Ako nakahingi sa kanila bago Ako nagkasakit.

And then 2022. Nagkasakit ako ng grabe. Stage 5 kidney disease. Dialysis for life. Tad tad ako sa gamot, kapos lagi sa Pera, ibat ibang side effects Ang nararamdaman ko. Lagnat, pneumonia, Hilo, panlalabo ng mata, pabghihina, pagod na di mawala Wala. At on top of that kapos ako sa pera, may trabaho ako WFH. Pero as of October force leave kami. Namamalimos na nga Ako halos ehhh. Sa mga kaibigan mga dating kaklase, katrabaho, may mga. Nagbigay madami ala.

Pinamasakit. My brother disowned me. Na brain wash ng nanay ko, ayaw daw Ako Makita. Ayaw ako dalawin. Napakasakit.

Now. I'm depressed. I barely get out of my bed, I locked myself sa kwarto ko. I isolated my self. I have no Hope and really I just want to die, bukod sa mga physically fragility ko. My mind is Soo frail at the moment the world means shit.. my wife keeps tugging me to live pero ewan ko.

Need Help with Relationship Issues,"Hello everyone,

Using a throwaway account to not be seen by anyone who knows my main on Reddit. 

I've been a long time lurker and this is my very first post. I've had a history with being suicidal. I overdosed when I was 17 years old and almost died in hospital. I was in a coma for 4 days. After I recovered, I was referred to a psychologist in The Medical City but I didn't follow through. I thought I didn't need it. 

Going straight to the currenr problem, I am in a relationship with an amazing person. He's every girl's dream. He's kind, thoughtful, understanding. Basically, he loves me with all he has. I'm a single mom and he loves my daughter equally. 

Me, on the other hand, no matter how hard I try, I can't seem to trust and believe him. At the back of my mind, there's always this little voice that tells me he's lying, he's cheating, he'll eventually leave me. All the negative stuff. I consciously fight all these thoughts but it's such a struggle that it's affecting our relationship. 

I've had one boyfriend before my current one for 9 years. We had a daughter. I want to say that it was a very abusive relationship emotionally. He would make me feel like I'm crazy for always accusing him of cheating with other girls - he's a serial cheater. He would make me feel guilty for being upset or sad. Like it's all my fault. In the end, we broke up because he got another girl pregnant. 

I feel like my current boyfriend is suffering because of the trauma I experienced in the past. I want to be better. I want to make him happy. I love him so much and I know he does too. 

Any kind of help with my situation would be really appreciated. 

Thank you for reading. 

TL;DR Having trust issues with current boyfriend because of past relationship and probably a more serious mental problem.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/cy76vr/need_help_with_relationship_issues/,t2_4hu9acqw,2019-09-01 15:41:47,3,7
"Please help, I really need an answer and support.","I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to post this.

Hello, I am a 14 year old girl from Germany (I'm turning 15 next month) and I've been struggling with mental problems since 4 months and they've gotten much more worse. Everything started in November last year, I've felt very depressed for weeks and went to a doctor without my parent's permission because they didn't want me to go there, so I told the doctor how I'm feeling and what I am thinking of doing and he told me it'd be the best if I'd go to therapy. He told my parents about the stuff I said and at first my parents seemed to be calm when we had a talk with the doctor but after me and my parents got home they got so fucking mad at me and my mom started to cry and my father insulted me and screamed at me. They're very afraid that the youth welfare might take away my younger sister (she's 2 years old) even though there wouldn't be a single reason why the youth welfare would take my little sister away from my parents because my parents care about us and treat us quite well. I already tried to explain to them that the youth welfare wouldn't have a reason to take my sister away from us but they didn't listen to me at all. They just kept yelling at me and told me that I'm turning their life into hell itself. They also forced me to tell the doctor that I feel better and so i did because I'm way too scared to tell the doctor the truth. After a month, I started to feel better but my mood swings got so so intense and its very hard for me to handle them, I know that having mood swings is normal when you're a teen and I sign wanna sound like I want attention or anything but I even throw stuff against the wall, break things, react very aggressive when somebody wants something from me, cut myself, cry alot and I get very paranoid when I have mood swings, I lost interest in all the things I enjoyed and my self esteem is dreadful, and I developed a very strong fear of abandonment, I know that every person has a fear of getting abandoned but whenever I think someone's going to leave me or looking for an excuse to leave me, I tell them that I'm going to kill myself if they leave me or I try to manipulate them or I leave them before they can leave me or I beg them not to leave me, I also apologize alot even when I didn't do anything at all. My grades have gotten so bad and its quite hard for me to focus and concentrate. I'm that typical introverted, shy girl in school, I have no friends irl since I was 12 because almost every friend I had used me and I can't take it anymore. I also have suicide thoughts and I am thinking about killing myself almost every day multiple times. I apologize for talking so much, lets get back to the main part. So, I also recently broke up with my long-distance relationship boyfriend but I already got over that but my parents still think I only behave like this because my ldr was so stressful, I don't believe so. My ldr wasn't the only reason why I started behaving like this, it was also because of my father. He's emotionally abuse and he's humiliating me alot (which fucked my mental health up alot too), it is also hard for me to maintain stable relationships with others and that's why I'm always alone. I've been isolating myself since 2 years and I only go outside when I have to go to school. My parents went to the youth welfare because they wanted to talk with my parents about my behavior and after my parents got home they told me what the youth welfare said ""you shouldn't go to the doctor without our permission"" and that's it...the doctor told me I can always come to him if I have any problems and now I fucking don't know if that's actually true or not...I'm just so confused. So, on February 16th we have to go to the doctor again because he wants me to decide whether if I want to go to a mental health facility or not, I didn't tell him about my suicide thoughts because I'm too scared what my parents might say. My mom and father said that the doctors are actually evil and that I don't need to go to a mental health facility because its jsut a phase and it'll be over soon...even if it's just a phase, I still really want that help and I want to go to a mental health facility because I can't do this alone, I can't keep going like this anymore but I'm so fucking scared and I don't know what to do. I already asked other people online and they just told me ""you should tell the doctor everything"" but it's not easy to do so...my father also keeps telling me that I'm faking all of this because I don't wanna go to school and because I want to destroy our family. I really need support to do this and id really appreciate if anyone who's reading this could give me some support and tell me what you think about the whole situation. Don't be shy to be honest please, and also if you have any questions go ahead and ask. I appreciate every comment.

Sooooooo Lost on my life path,"Hello mga ka reddit. I'm a 26F full time bpo worker. Feel ko reddit lang yung way ko na makapag vent out anonymously. 

Came from a very dysfunctional family. Long story short, I have a tita na ang tawag ko ay mommy dahil since birth siya na ang nag alaga sa akin, kinda adopted setup. Kapatid siya ng biological father ko. No comms ako sa biological parents except sa isang kuya ko na anak ng biological mom with a different man.

Before nag ka anak si mommy, ako lang yung meron siya and may kaya kami. She even have a taxi business so lahat ng luho like jb birthday parties and everything na experience ko. When she had her own children, dun nag bago trato niya sakin. Nung nagkaroon siya ng partner which I used to call Daddy everything went downhill. Tho happy naman siya ng light pa. Nung pinanganak niya na yung first daughter nia dun na nagbago yung trato niya sakin. I guess I was a child na ubod ng kulit but hurtful things were said na sana hindi na lang niya ako kinuha and the way na I discovered na hindi niya ako anak is yung sinabi niya na hindi ko kapatid yung baby niya. That young me suddenly changed from a happy go lucky and pala study na bata, I lost all interest for those things. After nun, lagi na pinapatawag ng mga teachers ko sila mommy. Tuwing may meeting sa school, walang na attend ng student parent meeting, if meron man hindi si mommy. As time goes by, palala ng palala yung panunumbat niya and pambubugbog. There was even one time na nakipag laro lang ako sa school mate ko and when I went home, hinambalos niya ako ng makapal na kahoy sa leg and knee area ko which caused me to have difficulties on walking the following day. My school mate even asked me if I was ok kasi nakita pala niya paano ako nabugbog nun. Tumagal yung ganyang setup namin hanggang sa grumaduate ako ng elementary.

2nd heartbreak is Graduation Day ko, I was hoping na maybe pupunta sia but boy I was so wrong, pinakiusapan niya yung bantay ng sari sari store namin na samahan ko sa graduation ko. Inintindi ko na lng din na mas priority nia ung business nia. During that, I can't help it but I cried nung may segment where students will approach their parents kasi inggit na inggit at the same time sobrang lungkot ko kasi I felt so alone that time. Same scenario din nung ALS Graduation ko hindi rin sia pumunta pero bestfriend ko ang sumama sakin which I was really grateful for her.

When I was in college, nagkaroon ng incident na I got sexually harassed and molested none other than the person whom I trusted and tinuring kong father figure which was her partner. Nung nagsumbong ako kay MOMMY, I already expected her reaction na hindi siya maniniwala na kayang gawin yun ng partner niya kasi all this time ang nakikita niya sakin is nothing but a good for nothing liar. That was my 3rd heartbreak na kung sino pa ang kamag anak ko siya pa ang hindi maniniwala. That incident still haunts me up until this day and might be the main cause of me developing Bipolar Disorder with Anxiety and Post Traumatic Disorder. Clinically diagnosed.

Ngayong 26 na ako, even ganun nangyari sakin di ko magawang iwanan si mommy and ang mga kinilala kong kapatid which is mga anak niya na pinsan ko. Up to this day never pa din nawawala panunumbat niya everytime na may bad day siya. I had several scde attempts before because of being verbally abused and everytime na nag brebreak down ako. All I want now is to help my 2 cousins na makatapos ng studies nila. Tinitiis ko na lang lahat ng masasakit na sumbat ng mom nila because I love those two as my own sibs.

Right now mga ka reddit, I'm so lost na hindi ko alam ano bang purpose ko. Hindi ko alam if lalaban pa ba ako. I may sound a cry baby pero pagod na pagod na ako. Everytime na mag brebreak down ako di lang siya masakit emotionally buong katawan ko sumasakit. Maybe meron kayong mashashare na tips how to fight this?. Sessions with my psychiatrist is only helping a little but nothing more than that",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/153ph5z/sooooooo_lost_on_my_life_path/,t2_h0ayahq7,2023-07-19 16:55:42,2,1
Sacrifices,"First time posting in reddit and I just need to vent this out.

background: Due to emotional abuse, I think I developed a phobia. Saan? No. Kanino? To my father. Umalis na sya sa bahay namin around August, finorce out sya ng mom ko kasi napansin nya na ayoko na umuwi sa bahay, or if nasa bahay ako nagkukulong lang ako sa kwarto and takot na din ako everytime I hear loud noises (banging of doors, shouting, even loud snores—gawain ng tatay ko). So I had this feeling of satisfaction for a while. I started my days normally nung umalis sya, found 2 jobs which I thought was great. Then one time na off ko, around October, nakita ko na may gamit sa may laundry area namin and a make-shift bed. Yung fan na di na namin ginagamit is nakaset up din. Tapos nung tinignan ko ung maliit na palangana, may may undies dun. Which I knew belonged to my dad. My mom was still keeping him apparently, and sobrang nawala ung tiwala ko sa nag-iisang taong macoconfidan ko. I am an only child, and although alam ng closest friend ko ung situation ko, pero wala din kasi syang magawa. Dati, sobrang close kami ng mom ko, I love her to death, sobrang sister like ang turungan namin. Pero nung nadiscover ko to, nawala talaga ung tiwala ko sa kanya. I still love my mom so much, I really do. Pero ung tinago nya sa akin eto, parang feel ko napapalayo na ako sa kanya...? May mga times na pag nangangamusta sya over work I get irritated tapos naalala ko na pinagtatakpan nya ung tatay ko...na alam ko na hindi dapat.

I called hopeline once, tapos ang rinecommend nila is to stay at someone’s home kahit 2 days lang to let my mom realize na kelangan nyang magdecide between papa and I. I can’t do it though. May takot ako kung anong mangyayare sa kanya if mawala ako sandali, feel ko kasi magpapanic siya. (One time naiwan ko phone ko sa bahay and di ko sya natext for 2 hours dahil sa commute, and umiyak and nagbreak down sya sa work, calling my boss even. I texted her through my boss’s phone nung nakarating naman ako and told her that I left my phone.) Ganong scenario ba.

Hopeline also recommended that if this continued, I should probably rent away from home. I was thinking about this a lot. Nagcacanvass na ako actually kasi hanggang ngayon, nakikita ko pa din gamit ng tatay ko sa laundry area. And twice, I saw him personally sa bahay. Involuntarily talaga umiyak ako tapos nagkulong sa kwarto. I was shaking kasi feeling ko uulitin na naman ng tatay ko ung ginawa nya dati. So aun, balak ko lumipat ng bahay next year pag nakaipon na ako.

Anyway, kanina. Supposedly matutulog na kami ng mom ko (we share the same room, this, I actually don’t mind) pero biglang may nagtext sya kanya tapos pumunta sya downstairs. I was growing suspicious tapos bumaba ako half way the stairs tapos sabi ko “Ma may problema ba? Bat ka bumaba?” Then sabi nya wala, wala. Tapos nung pag akyat namin she told me ng pabulong, “nanghihingi lang ng pagkain papa mo, pero umalis na” na sa akin ay...hindi reassuring.

So I broke down. Tapos sinabi ko na sa mama ko lahat ng plan ko. Na pag nagpatuloy pa lilipat ako ng bahay. And as expected—Sinabi niya “sige, iwanan mo na ako. Hayaan mo na ako mamatay. Di ko bayaran bills natin para makulong ako” and I just feel so constricted. I love her so much and hearing her say those things hurt me, pero paano naman ung sa akin?

Do I constantly need to live in fear? In suspicion kasi andito si papa din sa bahay at di lang kami nagtatagpo? Dapat po ba isacrifice ko ang well-being ko for the sake of my love for my mum?

Help me please. 

Sorry for the long post.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/ecuk85/sacrifices/,t2_125e3oi4,2019-12-19 23:18:52,2,1
how do I help my friend with her self worth?,"Hi there, I hope this is ok to post here.

I'm really worried about my friend, K. She's been through some bad stuff since she was young, like, her mom is toxic and manipulative, used to abuse her physically and emotionally to the point where now K's low view about herself is basically an echo of the stuff her mom says to her. She also has a younger sibling, who K used to be very close to, who's gotten into hard drugs and is in and out of jail. So all of this basically piles on top of her.

We're currently in graduate school where the exams can be pretty tough. She tries her hardest and you can see it. The professors see it too. But she barely passes courses. This results in her getting extremely down on herself, saying she's useless and that she should just drop out now. (Which, I can absolutely understand and see where that comes from.)

There are some days too where things pile up on her, so she leaves class early instead of staying back to chat like we always do, so we don't see her break down. Normally, she has a beautiful and kind and helpful personality that brightens a room, so when it's been shadowed out, you immediately notice. I'll text her after class wondering where she went and won't hear back, but I understand her needing to shut down for a couple hours. Once she does respond though, it's with ""it's dumb, I don't deserve (being happy), other people have it worse, I'm just being a little bitch, I'm done trying (to get better)"", etc.

She reminds me of myself when I was younger. We both were too kind and giving with our friends, which left us trampled on and left behind when those friends would hang out. I would also be down on myself, say I don't deserve things and spiral out of control. But I was very fortunate with my support system and went to therapy so I learned how to get myself out. my first step was changing my mentality about myself, which I know is a lot more difficult for other people. I've been trying to help her with this but sadly, the echo from her mother is rooted deep in her, so no matter what, she's incredibly harsh on herself and nothing can convince her otherwise.

I've asked her to see a psychiatrist, but we live in a busy, populated area so her appointments are only once a month. I was lucky with my therapist and was able to call her whenever I had an off day, and I believe K needs that support as well. However, if she doesn't hear back from the psychiatrist within a day, she thinks they've ""run away"" because of how she's ""too much"" and won't follow up with them. (Which has happened to her before.) I've tried to tell her she should follow up because they may just be busy, but she brushes me off by laughing about it or says ""we'll see. I'll get better soon, I've gotten this far""

I don't believe she's immediately suicidal, but she has made jokes recently that makes me worry deeply, which I've expressed to her. I've tried to be gentle and slow with her when she spirals, but she'll respond with ""nah I just need to suck it up, I'm overreacting and being a little bitch"" (which is exactly what her mom says to her.) If I try to do tough love and be straight with her, no beating around the bush, she'll laugh it off or brush it off with ""I'll be okay by tomorrow, thanks for the pep talk."" 

I'm never going to abandon her. She needs this support because she has no one else. But this is starting to affect my mental health too. I'm worried though if I step away for a day, she'll think it's because she's ""too much"" and will just be upset with herself again, which I don't want at all.

How can I approach this? How do I convince her that she's worthy and deserving of good, stable mental health? That she's not a burden on anyone and she should love herself? I know I cannot change her overnight, nor can I force her to go to therapy. I just need something, anything, to help her. Any advice, good or bad (like telling me off), will be appreciated.
