I was physically abused my boyfriend (now my ex),"I’m 23 F and was physically abused by my ex last Feb 13. It was really bad, I was in pain all over my body and I had severe pain on head and scalp because of the punching and hair pulling I received. I couldn’t sleep the night after it happened because even with soft pillows masakit pa din. I had spent my Valentine’s Day in the hospital to get checked. I went to my usual doctor but she refused to see me after knowing my situation. She refused because she doesn’t want to get involved if ever magsampa ako ng kaso sa ex ko. I told her I’m not planning to and I just wanted to get checked kasi masakit talaga buong katawan ko but she still refused to get me checked and instead referred me to a general surgeon. There, I was interviewed again by another secretary and was asked why I was referred to their clinic. I gave her the referral and told her I wanted to get checked because I was physically abused. After hearing that, she proceeded to ask questions personal questions as to why I was physically abused. And not only her, even the surgeon asked me personal stuff. Idk if it’s part of their job to ask but it was really uncomfortable for me. I remember crying in the cr right after the consultation. I feel so embarrassed, so ashamed of the situation I’m in. I feel like people are judging me for being physically abused. The way people are treating me felt like it was my fault that I got myself physically abused. I was asked to get a ct scan of my brain because of head trauma injury. I was using my insurance so i went to the hmo cashier with the doctor’s referral. While processing, the cashier asked loudly why I had to get a brain plain bec apparently it was expensive and they wouldn’t easily approve it. There was a line behind me and i was embarrassed to say it out loud so iasked if i could write it instead. I wrote what my doctor wrote in his diagnosis, head trauma injury due to physical abuse.  The cashier seemed confused and asked me, “what do you mean by physical abuse?” She then told me to write a full incident report, time date and what has happened to me. So, I wrote there in detail what happened to me so that she’ll process na my form and I could get a ct scan na. Is this really part of the protocol? Do the patient really have to do this? Because it was really uncomfortable for my part. I was physically in pain and it doesn’t help that they’re also stressing me out mentally, making me recall everything that happened just so it would be approved by my insurance. It’s so fucking stressful for the patient. Don’t get me wrong, I’m grateful man na i get to go to the hospital to get treated but i didnt expect it to be this stressful. I even chose to go to this hospital, my university’s hospital, because I thought it would be more efficient than going to a public hospital. If only I knew na I would be rejected by my doctor, will be bombarded by personal questions, judged for being physically abused, and then forced to recall what happened to me, then I would’ve just stayed home na lang even though sakit na kaayo akong lawas. I’m supposed to go back to the doctor today, but idk man, i dont feel like getting up and going back. I’m still in pain tho, masakit pa din igalaw ang katawon ko but agwantahon lang guro nako ni than go back.

why do Filipino famillies resort to physical abuse and humiliation whenever their child makes a mistake?,"I recently crashed my mom’s car around 1am cus I was going to another town to find something to eat. While it was raining hard I was driving casually with my highbeam turned on, suddenly I hit an “school-zone” signage pretty hard and it caused for the front of the car to be shattered. Regardless, I waited for my mom to get back from work so I can tell her ASAP. When she got back I told her directly that I recked her car and said all my apologies and told her I was willing to accept all consequences. She suddenly slapped me so hard that I fell to the floor. She probably bruised my whole body from smacking me with a broom stick for 1 hour straight and after that she had enough. While I was inside my room I overheard her talking to all of her friends and our relatives on how I am such a disappointment and basically degraded me to her friends.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/17mlwmo/why_do_filipino_famillies_resort_to_physical/,t2_63lybacdt,2023-11-03 11:28:58,69,81
I actually dont know you anymore (PHYSICAL ABUSE!),"Hello guys, i am 22F dating a 23M, currently nauna ako grumaduate sakanya and working already and pagraduate palang siya this june i think. Nag start mag messed up yung relationship namin nung grumaduate ako. 
Lagi niyang sinasabe na sobrang selfish ko para unahin sarili ko dahil umuwi ang inay galing sa Japan for just 5days para lang sa baccalaureate mass at graduation day ko. Pinakilala ko siya samin that time, welcome na welcome siya noon at tuwang tuwa ang nanay ko dahil nga may pagka gwapo at natutuwa din ang nanay sa pagkekwento ng mga nangyayari saamin. 

Habang pauwi na ang inay noon, may biglaang yakag din ang fam ni boyfie, sa manila ocean park at gustong gusto niya ako makasama nun dahil nga nagtampo sakin dahil sobra akong naaging busy nung mga araw na yon. Sinabe ng nanay ko na maaga daw ang flight nya 9am palang at nasa airport na kami. Don nag start lahat. Nung nasa ocean park na kami, ako yung nahihiyang lumapit sa mgaa kamag anak niya parang feeling ko di ako belong at dahil nga first time ko na kasama pamilya niya, nahihiya ako. (Introverted po ako) at gusto niya sumusunod ako sa trip niya, naiinis na siya sakin kasi di ako sumasabay sa lakad nila dahil gusto ko ako nasa hulihan ng pamilya. Tapos nung mga time na yon nahalata na ng lahat na galit yung boyfriend ko sakin, at nahihiya na din ako lalo dahil sinabihan akong pabebe ng kanyang kapatid. Aaminin kong may pagkakamali din naman ako na gusto ko nasa hulihan ako dahil pakiramdam ko hindi naman ako ganun kaimportante sa lakad nila, at lumala pa yun nung paalis na at kakain sa vikings dahil sabi ko gusto ko na umuwi at ayoko na makaistorbo pero pinipilit ako ng pamilya niya na mag stay at kumain dahil sayang naman daw at graduation ko nga, makakain at makapag celebrate man lang daw. Pero ayoko na, dahil sobrang hiyang hiya na ako at feeling ko iiyak nalang ako kapag andon lang kami. Considering yung jowa ko na hindi na ako tinitignan at nagagalit na din saakin. Despite ng nangyari, sinamahan ako ng jowa ko sa moa sa sea side, akala ko magkakaayos kami non pero sinabihan niya lang ako 'magbreak na tayo ha tangina ang selfish mo'. Wala akong alam sa manila, dahil taga laguna kami pareho at never akong lumalakad doon, battery ko nun 30 percent nalang at mas pinili ko na umiyak sa seaside at contakin ang kaibigan ko kaysa makauwi. Nawala na din yung jowa ko sa paningin ko at girap na hirap ako makahinga nung mga oras na yon, pero binalikan niya ako after isang oras ata. Umuwi na kami. Sinabi ko lahat sa nanay ko mga nangyari at inamin din ng nanay ko na sinabe niya lang na maaga ang flight nya kasi nakikita niya akong masaya sa lalaking yon. Binalikan niya din ako nagmakaawa siya non ako namang si tanga, oo lang..

Fast forward nakahanap na ako ng trabaho, nakapag work na din ako at nagkanda leche leche din side ng fam niya. Yung ate niya na sinabihan akong pabebe, nag kautang utang at yung mga pinapadala sakanila ay sinarili lang non. Ramdam ko yung lungkot at galit ng boyfriend ko dahil patapos na siya sa pag aaral at wala man lang perang mailabas. Sinisi niya ako sa mga nangyare at sinabihan din ako ng kung ano ano, sa totoo lang dito ako nag start na ayoko na siyang replyan dahil hindi din biro sakin ang mga nangyayari sa work ko pero iniisip ko pa din na magbabago siya, iniisip ko pa din na magiging okay ang lahat at gusto ko pa din siyang maksama.

Ff ule, nung nakausap nya tatay niya need na niya mag OJT sa manila dahil aviation siya at iilan lang ang pwede nyang applyan at lahat ng yon ay nasa manila, madalas kaming nag aaway nung mga oras na yon dahil pa din sa hindi niya ako maintindihan kung gano ako nasstress sa work ko at gusto niya na palagi din syang lambingin dahil nga daw yung sitwasyon nila sa pera ay di biro. Sinabi ko sakanya noon na, maganda na buhay mo jan nakakakain ka ng dalawang beses sa isang araw dahil nung andito siya minsan ay di pa makakain dito sa laguna dahil nga lugmok na sila sa utang. At one time noon, nakita ko na naggpost yung palagi niiyang kinakainan sa lunch time nya na restobar sa pasay, may kasama siyang babae at halata mong may gusto siya don. Sobrang galit ko sakanya at hiningi ko din password ng mga acct nya nung oras na gusto niya din magbalikan kami. Nakita ko don na mukhang naglalandian na sila sa ig, at hinatian pa nila ng pamasahe para makauwi after non at tinatanong niya pa kung nakauwi na siya. Ang sakit hanggang ngayon inaalala ko pero wala akong magawa, gusto ko pa din siya. At feeling ko naguilty din siya dahil nakikipag ayos siya sakin non. Nalaman din ito ng magulang ko sa sobrang iyak ko nun dito samin, kinwento ko lahat na minumura niya din ako at mukhang ginagago na ako sa mga nangyayare. Pero mali din kasi approach sakin ng magulang ko kaya sobrang nagalit ako sakanila lalo ang lola ko, sinabi niya sakin straight up na ganto ""Pineperahan ka lang nyan, tigilan mo na yan ha"" sakit s pakiramdam kasi feeling ko sobrang pangit ko, na aabot sa point na peperahan lang ako ng tao. Pero iniisip ko hindi, hindi dahil noon naman ay kahit pamasahe never akong pinagbayad ng boyfriend ko. Siguro nga noon, kasi payat pa ako nun at nastress na ako nitong nagwwork na ko tumaba na ng sobra baka kaya nga ganon. 

Nung December 24, umuwi sya samin nag away pa din kami non dahil gusto ko ngang umuwi na siya at bakit kailangan niya pang itanong yon dahil natural gusto ko na siyanf kasama, ang tagal na naming di nagkita simula nung umalis siya dito. Halos 3months din. Sobrang inis ko non dahil binlock niya ako sa lahat gawa ng sinabihan ko siya na 'tatanong mo pa eh gusto ko ngang kasama ka' at di ko na siya makontak kahit saan, tapos biglang magtetext uuwi na daw siya. Pinaghawak nya ako ng gamit niya, sobrang galit ko non dahil nag ayos ako nun at hindi man lang din siya ngumiti nung mga oras na nagkita kami. Iniwan niya ako sa terminal non papunta sa bahay nila dahil nagalit ako, sinabe ko na di man lang nya ako kinausap the whole time tapos pinagbuhat pa ng gamit nya at di man lang nya ako tinabihan sa jeep habang bumabyahe kami. 

Pinuntahan ko sa bahay at sinundan dahil, ngayon na nga lang kami magkikita nagaway pa at iniisip ko baka di na kami magkita dahil pupunta siya sa mga kamag anak niya. Pinagbuksan nya ako ng pinto pero, galit din siya at gusto niyang lumayas na ako, sinasabe nya na ang pangit ng ugali ko at never ko siyang naintindihan sobrang selfish ko na tao. Binalibag nya yung bag na dala ko noon, nasira pa yung palamuti na nakasabit sa bag ko dahil sa pwersa nya tinapon niya sa labas yon ng bahay nila at nagmamadali akong kunin dahil pakiramdam ko sasarahn nya ako ng pinto at di ko na siya makakausap, nagalit din ako pagbalik ko sakanya at sinabeng 'wala kang karapatan ihagis bag ko sa kung saan pano kung may nabasag dito kaya mong palitan?'' tas sinabi nya saken na' eh ikaw? Andito ka pa din sinasabe ko na ngang umalis kana' sinigawan ko siya at minura, sa sobrang frustrated ko sinusuntok ko yung braso niya, nagalit din siya at sinampal niya ako ng dalawang beses. Umiyak nalang ako at lumuhod sakanya, sabi ko 'tama na ayoko na ng away please' umalis siya at pumunta sa kwarto niya nilock niya ang pinto. Pero di pa din ako naawat, gusto ko pa din magbati kami, nagkabati kami non pero ang bigat sa pakiramdam.

Ngayon, sabado ng holy week di ko alam pero mukhang malabo na magkaayos kami. Pumunta ako nung tuesday nag overnight hanggang wednesday ng hapon, dahil nga sobrang miss ko na din siya. Kaso nakaligpit na din lahat ng gamit sakanila dahil lilipat na sila ng apartment, at nakikita nyang naiinip lang ako sa bahay nila dahil wala kaming ginagawa, sabi ko 6pm ako uuwi pero napaaga dahil sabe nya 5 nalang daw kasi nga ramdam niya ang inip ko, sinabihan nya ako na pumunta pa ng sabado dahil gusto nya ako makita one last time bago siya umuwi, di din ako umoo kasi feeling ko mapapacheck up yung aso ko dahil nagluluga ang tenga at di na nakakatulog sa gabi. Paguwi ko, sinabihan ako ng uncle ko na magsama kaming magpacheck up ng aso inabot ng 6k yung bill ko at ang cut off ko per kinsenas ay 8k lang, sobrang sakit sa bulsa nung mga oras na yon dahil magbbday na din ako at nailabas ko din ang frustration ko sa bf ko nung time na yon. Akala ko maiintindihan niya yung sinabe ko na 350 nalang nasa wallet ko at di pa nag sstart ang work ko ay baka wala akong budget na, tapos nung biyernes santo sinasabi nya na uuwi daw siya ng maaga kinabukasan at sabi ko ay okay po love, tas tinanong nya ko kung masaya daw ako sabi ko okay lang why? At sabi nya naman ay 'cause me useless' tas naiisip ko na kaya siya naggaganon dahil nga gusto niya ako makita ule kaya nagpapaka dramatic ang atake. Brinush off ko siya at sinabe ko na 'walang.mapapala yang kakaganyan mo isipin mo byernes santo at wala naman akong sinabeng di ako masaya eh sabi ko okay lang di masaya di malungkot kasi nga wala namang ganap ngayon eh byernes santo malamang' nagalit siya binlock niya ako sa lahat tangina ito nanaman. Sobrang inis ko sakanya kung ano ano den pinagsasabe ko sa text non para lang makuha atensyon niya na gusto ko dwn intindihin nya ko. Pero kanina pinuntahan ko siya sa kanila kahit walang wala na ako. Napunta sa pisikalan at ang masaklap don tinatawanan nya ako dahil mukha lang daw akong baboy na galit. Sobrang sakit, kinalmot ko siya non at sinakal ko din sa leeg sa sobrang inis ko. Siya din nag start na magsisigaw gustong gusto niya akong saktan kitang kita ko sa mata niya, at isinisigaw nya dahil sinabi nya saken na di na daw siya magiging ganong tao na nanakit. Pero minomock nya ako non naka suntok na yung fist niya sabay gagawing palakpak at tatawanan ako dahil umiilag ako. Nung time na sinabihan nya na ako na para akong baboy na galit don siya dahil binabaon ko yung kuko ko habang sinasakal ko siya. Papunta na siya sa suntok at sumigaw ako non, inawat kami ng parents nya at tinatawanan niya ako dahil umiilag ako. Sinabe nya non na 'di kita sinasaktan diyan ikaw ang nananakit tignan mo oh mga pagkakalmot nyan tangina, umuwi ka na sinasabe ko sayo ha' ewan ko.

 Hanggang ngayon ang sakit isipin kasi alam mong di na talaga maayos lahat at kahit maayos man, alam kong di na ako safe sa mga mangyayare lalo magpapatuloy pa. Di ko na kilala yung taong minahal ko ng todo, di ko din alam kung infatuated lang ba ako dahil first time ko naramdaman mga bagay bagay sakanya kaya hanggang ngayon masakit sa loob ko. Totoo ba na pag nakita mo yung ganyang ugali ng tao ay ganyan talaga sila at di na magbabago? Kung kaya niyo naman ako bigyan ng facts sa kung bakit ganito parang feeling ko may mali pa din sakin na gusto ko p din siya kahit may abuse na nangyayari. Hindi madali yung mga nangyaare ngyon dahil kahit mgulang ko pakiramdam ko di ko kakampi sa mga bagay bagay. Nahihirapan na ako.

Tired of being Physically Abused ,"Growing up, not once in my childhood days till my teenager life na nakaramdam ng Gentleness (Aside sa care ng Late Lola ko sa side ng Papa ko).

Ayun, based sa Title, buong buhay ko I have been physically abused especially ng Trauma provider na Father ko. Normally yung mga bata makukulit talaga and you needed a lot of patience to deal with them. Pero ako, even minor mistakes hampas agad, hahambalusin ng kung ano mahawakan mapa bakal, kahoy, kung ano man yan, minsan iuuntog ka na lang sa pader (Take note, I was 9 years old back then).

Kasi nga ganun daw sila pinalaki, so dapat kami din 'di daw dapat namin maranasan mga pinagdaanan nila'. Well thank you for giving me all the pain I felt growing up, na minsan gusto ko na lang nun sabihin kay lord na kunin na ako.

But still, buti di naranasan ng bunso namin yung Physical Abuse growing up, kasi pinaranas mo naman masira Family natin. Congrats, you've earned your place in Hell.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1bs3fd0/tired_of_being_physically_abused/,t2_x4yg79yyo,2024-03-31 14:07:35,2,1
"The girl I like has a girlfriend, and her girlfriend was physically abusing her.","The girl I like has a girlfriend, and her girlfriend was physically abusing her. She's also my friend from school, and I feel inlove with her. And yes I'm les. Nung 2021 kasi, nagkaroon sya ng gf na kaklase rin namin, it was fine with me, I'm actually happy for them. Not until magkwento sakin yung friend ko na gusto ko pa rin until now na sinasaktan daw sya ng gf nya physically kapag nagagalit yung gf nya, and nabanggit nya rin na yung gf nya ay pinagtatawanan sya sa harap ng mga kaibigan ng gf nya pag umiiyak sya. And habang kinukwento nya sakin to sobrang tumatayo yung balahibo ko to the point na hindi ko na alam kung anong sasabihin ko, I can't say naman na hiwalayan nya na kasi baka isipin nyang sinabi ko yon for my benefit, and first time ko lang din makaencounter ng ganong situation, kaya super hindi ko alam kung anong pwede kong sabihin para matulungan ko sya or dapat bang tulungan ko sya since friend ko naman sya eh. Hindi ko rin masabing hiwalayan nya kasi wala naman ako sa posisyon para sabihin sakanya yon and I know kung gano nya kamahal gf nya kaya tinitiis nya lahat ng bugbog sakanya. Ayaw nya ring may ibang makaalam sa family nilang dalawa. Any tips kung anong pwedeng sabihin or gawin or dapat ba wag na akong makielam since relationship naman nilang dalawa yon? 

to add lang din, nagkaroon pala yung gf nya ng bf sa work na pamilyadong tao, and ayaw nya ipakita sa friend ko yung cp nya kasi nga tinatago nya pero sya sa friend ko, kontrolado nya lahat ng social media nya na kahit mga kaklase nya for acad purposes ay pinagbabawalan nya makipag usap sa friend ko. Kahit ako hindi ko na rin sya nakakausap, nakwento nya lang sakin nung time na nanghiram sya ng book for acads din.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/10dhbeu/the_girl_i_like_has_a_girlfriend_and_her/,t2_vh4zj41l,2023-01-16 23:26:14,6,3
Na survive ko ang physical at emotional abuse today,"3 sampal at katakot takot na threats dahil sa walang humpay na pag iyak ko, sampalin ka ba naman eh. 

Para akong mababaliw kanina, hinihila, sinisiko, pinipilit mag salita, tinutulak. Para akong pinalong aso sa pag iyak  na naka suksok sa sulok tas pag hinahawakan lalong lumalakas ang iyak dahil nakakatakot na bawat hawak sayo may hagupit na kapalit. 

Hindi ko akalain na magagawa sakin ng SO (now ex) ko to. First time kong masaktan sa relationship at trauma is real. Dahil lang sa di ko masunod ang gusto nya kahit at risk ang health ko. 

Tinapos ko na at sana huling encounter na namin sa isa't Isa. Naiiyak ako pag naiisip ko yung ginawa nya. Mahal nya daw ako pero bakit ganun? Pag mamahal pa ba yun kung ganoon?

Namatay na yung tita ko who physically & emotionally abused me & my sister nung highschool kami pero wala akong naramdaman nung nawala sya.,"Napatawad ko na sya. Nakahingi pa nga sya ng tawad 2 months bago sya namatay. Sabi ko, wala na yun tita. Kalimutan mo na yun.  Totoong napatawad ko na sya pero traumatized pa rin ako pag may mga bagay na nakakapang trigger sa akin ng mga bad memories na iyon.

Unexpected ang death nya. Nasa Canada na ko ngayon. Nung nabalitaan ko yon, iyak ng iyak mama ko. Pero ako, wala. Blanko lang. Of course hindi ako masaya sa nangyari pero hindi rin naman ako nalungkot at naapektuhan.

I feel bad for feeling this way.

7 years din kaming nasa puder nya. May mga good memories naman pero bilang lang. Pag lang naka mood sya pag may pera sya that time. Pag wala, ayun, Princess Sarah at Ms. Minchin na ang atake.

Hindi ko masabi to sa mama ko kasi alam kong masasaktan sya. Kapatid nya yun at mahal nya. Kahit may nagawang ganun ang tita ko, sobrang buti ng mama ko at pinatawad nya.

Sabi ng mama kahit ano raw nagawang masama sa amin, wag na wag daw kaming hihiling ng ikakasama ng iba.

Gusto ko lang din sabihin na proud ako na sya ang mama ko. <3",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/19987qx/namatay_na_yung_tita_ko_who_physically/,t2_knsfqyyap,2024-01-18 05:24:41,283,0
Sudden thought of leaving my bf of 5 years,"OFF MY CHEST, bahala na kayo ano sasabihin nyo sakin o i wish nyo ko mauntog. 

We met 201- , senior high school. Best friends kami until 201-, nung nagka inlaban haha. (We were teens that time, 20’s na kami ngayon: M/F couple) Until now going strong. If you will know our story, ang solid ng foundation ng relasyon namin, legal on both sides up to the very extended families (ex. 2nd cousins and farther), have a close circle of friends, and super compatible ng ugali namin. 

But there’s one thing i cannot take, he’s very emotionally/verbally abusive. He call me names/below the belt insults, name it. Pag galit sya o inis sya sakin. Actually nag lessen na ngayong tumatanda na kami, dati? I call s*icide hotline almost every night crying dahil sa mga words nya. Umabot na din kami sa physical abuse years ago. He’s hurting me every time galit sya. 

Now, wala nang physical abuse, nag lessen na ang verbal abuse. But nung nag away kami and pinag mumura nanaman ako. Di kami nag usap for a while, nag chat sya and all caps mura ang chat tas wala na ulit. All of a sudden I wanted to leave him. There’s something holding me back, baka impulsive move lang. pero grabe yung urge ko ngayon. 

Hindi ko na alam. If tatanungin nyo ko kung mahal ko sya, oo. Pero grabe gusto ko na syang iwan. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1c0k74p/sudden_thought_of_leaving_my_bf_of_5_years/,t2_onvht66od,2024-04-10 20:19:45,14,22

Living with my abuser.,"#Trigger warning 
#I need help. 

#I married a monster.

Long post ahead. Please bare with me.  

I consider myself as a single mom of many kids. 

Isipin niyo na lahat ng word na pwede niyo ikabit sa word na abused. Ako yun. 

Sinasaktan niya ako if I refuse to have sex with him. Ang sabi niya “responsibilidad” ko daw yun bilang asawa. NO THAT’S MARITAL RAPE kako. Meron pang isang bagay na gustong gusto niya ginagawa pero di ko na masasabi kasi it will be a give away. (Sexual and physical abuse). 
He cheated on me and I had STD not once, not twice… I told him that it’s actually ground for annulment. Feeling ko ang dumi dumi ko. 

Ilan taon na ako lang ang bumuhay sa pamilya namin. (Economic abuse) 

Gina-gaslight niya ako and he used emotional manipulation. He one time said he’d kill himself dahil ayaw kong makipag sex sa kanya.  (Emotional abuse). 

To name a few. 

Ilang beses na akong nag attempt na makipag hiwalay sa kanya, but he knows I have a forgiving heart. Pero lahat my limit. Nauubos din tayo. 

We moved to a different city to start a new life. Ang alam ng mga friends ko hiwalay na kami. Which is partly true. Di ko lang sinabi na nagkabalikan kami kasi I used it as an excuse (not my proudest moment) I don’t like telling lies. Siguro napapansin nila na di ko sinasagot yung mga tanong nila. Para di na ako mag lie pa. 

It was so bad na umabot ako sa point that I almost kill myself. 2 tao lang nakakaalam nito. 

Few years ago he throw a fit kasi ayaw kong makipag sex sa kanya. I was so tired galing sa work tapos ako pa naglinis ng house. He was jobless. Pag di nagwo-work yung pagwawala niya he resorts to verbal abuse towards my kids. Hindi ko kinaya. I begged him to kill me para matapos na lahat ng paghihirap ko. Few months after that nagtino. So kala ko ok na. Nope. Nagkawork lang siya pero ganun pa din. Masaya kaming lahat sa bahay pag wala siya. Tahimik ang mundo. 

Couple of years ago I decided na ayaw ko na talaga. I told him to move out. But he didn’t. But for me hiwalay na kami. Pinaalis ko siya sa room. No physical contact di ko kinakausap nakablock sa lahat. I decided to take care of myself again. Nag message siya bigla using a different number, asking for sex. Like WTF! Seryoso? He began stalking my accounts. Called me a slut at may lalake daw ako. 

Last year he beat the shit out of me. Nag pa blotter ako, VAWC, pati sa Barangay. Walang nangyari. Sabi aalis na siya ng bahay pero nandito pa din. He threatens to kill me harm my family and friends at work. 

Madami siya kilala na influential na tao.

Violence Against Men,"TW: Physical Abuse

It just feels disappointing that men have no legal protection against any form of abuse or domestic violence. I (M31) had an ex gf who used to hurt me physically, and it occurred many times. Note that I did not cheat on her nor committed any grave offense against her. But everytime her emotions piled up, she used to hurt me physically, as in I got slaps on my face, arm, etc. 

After 9 months, I called it quits. I did not stand the abuse anymore. 

While women and children have legal protection, men are ought to just endure it and shut up, otherwise we will be viewed as weak ass pussies. Pardon the french.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/183less/violence_against_men/,t2_jhn2qk11,2023-11-25 22:54:38,11,2
Andrew Tate wannabe gets karma,"Sobrang cringe ko talaga sa sarili ko for having a long term relationship with a guy super fan ni Andrew tate. 

Matagal na kami no contact pero grabe yung mga narinig ko na stories tungkol sa kanya. Alam ko totoo kasi nung kami pa grabe talaga ugali niya. Napa therapy ako at nireport ko yan sa police dahil sa physical abuse.

Dami niyang nakakaputangina beliefs about women, men and society. At super deny pa siya na malala yung verbal, mental & almost physical abuse sa recent ex niya. Halos lahat ng ginawa ng ex ko sakin x2 mas malala na ginawa niya sa recent girl. Naawa ako sa girl, sana safe na siya now. 

ANG KARMA NIYA:

Nakita ko inexpose ng mga mutuals namin lahat ng kagaguhan niya sa ibang mga ex niya.

Yung latest na chika na narinig ko nahospital daw dahil sa anxiety dahil kinacancel na siya online. PAVICTIM PA SIYA.

Todo deny pa siya pero we all know the truth. Kawawa lahat ng babae na mamemeet niya. 

Ingat rin sa IG mga girls, dun siya kumukuha ng next ex niya. Kung gusto niyo ng name drop PM HAHA CHAR.

Alam ko nagchecheck yan sa reddit kung nacancel na rin siya dito. Kadire talaga.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/13rqy7z/andrew_tate_wannabe_gets_karma/,t2_s2qijldh,2023-05-26 03:32:12,50,15
I left the chat group.,"She got abusive partner. 
I’ll make this short and simple. 
3 kami sa group namin, mag kakainigan nakami since highschool so more than a decade na. 
Si A meron siyang 2 naging partner and both may anak siya sa dalawa. 
Nag cheat siya sa unang partner niya kaya, pinili niya yung 2nd partner niya kasi nabuntis siya. 
Now yung 2nd partner niya is sinasaktan suya physically. 2x na siyang sinakal and yung last time sa labas pa ng apartment nila at kita ng lahat ng tao. 

The guy already have ‘mental health issue’ kuno pero ayaw naman patingin. Dati inuuntog niya lang sarili niya sa pader pag nag aaway sila. Tapos ngayon nananakit na siya. Hindi sinabi ng guy ano exact reason bat niya ginawa yun regardless di parin sapat na reason yun para manakit. 

Kaya lang sila nag kakaganyan dahil hirap sila financial. Stay at home si A kasi breastfeed pa ang baby nila. 

Going back sa guy, nagpaawa siya na kesyo sirang sira na daw siya saamin, habang siya wala daw siyang mapagsabihan kasi ayaw niya daw masira si A. 
Masira from what?? Kahit saan angle mo tignan maling manakit or mag resort sa physical. Babae pa naman baby nila di niya naisip na yung sinasaktan niya is nanay ng anak niya? 

Anyway, na guilty daw si A sabi niya sa group chat. 
Hindi nalang ako umimik kasi sobrang galit ako bigyan pa daw niya ng last chance. 

And that’s when i rant. Saying na ang galing magpaawa ng lalaki, nakuha kanya sa ganyan, remind him about our law may VAWC tayo baka gusto niya mag himas rehas, etc etc.. 

Sagot ni A ‘move on na tayo let’s give him last chance’ 

My last chat before i leave sa GC 

‘Pass, bat ko siya bibigyan ng chance? Ikaw lang magbibigay ng chance sakanya. Balitaan niyo nalang ako pag makikipag lamay ako sa burol mo’ 

Galit ako,oo
Pero anong gusto nila? Makisama at magbulag bulagan? Hindi ba enabler ang tawag saakin pag hinahayaan ko lang? 

I left the GC kasi pagod na ako. Pagod na akong damayan siya tapos wala naman din siyang gagawin para ayusin situation niya. Di ko narin masikmuraan na makipag plastikan dun sa guy. 

Pagod na ako marinig ngawa niya sa GC tapos sasabihan kami na ‘let’s give him another chance’ 

Damayan niyo naman ako! HAHAHA gusto ko lang talaga ilabas tong gigil ko.

Edit: just to add pala. Her mom is also victim of physical abuse. So nasaksihan niya yung pambugbog ng tatay niya. Her mom told her na iwan na yung guy the first time na sinaktan siya cuz her mom is right ‘mauulit at mauulit yon. Magiging habit na nya’ 

Sa sobrang trauma ni A natatakot siyang matulog kasi baka ano daw gawin sakanya or di niya siya magising. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/18g1j8t/i_left_the_chat_group/,t2_nnhhm0201,2023-12-12 03:17:15,126,50
living in an abusive and toxic household,I was around 7 years old nung nakaexperience ako ng physical abuse galing sa dad ko.

Pagod na ako sa sarili ko,"Di ko alam kung kanino ko sasabihin lahat ng 'to so dito ko na ilalabas. 

Bata palang ako alam ko na na may mali sakin. Madaming nangyari sa buhay ko na naging dahilan para maging ganito ako. From Emotional to Physical abuse, to Financial and s*xual abuse. 

It started with anger management issues, mood swings,disruption in sleep up to extreme forgetfulness. Yung sobrang makakalimutin ko and yung pagiging inattentive ko, yung pinaka malaking reason kung bakit nahihirapan ako ngayon. I can't even remember what I did today and even yesterday. 

Depression comes in and go sakin. Di ko alam kung kailan ako last na mawalan ng suicidal thoughts or kung kailan ako nagkaroon ng genuine interest sa mga bagay sa paligid ko. Di ko na maalala.

Childhood trauma affect adult relationships ,"I've known it all my life that I haven't healed from my childhood trauma. I just thought that since di ko na iniisip childhood ko, wala na siya.

I realized why I continued and stayed with my abusive ex. It was because the abuse was a familiar wound. It was a situation I've been in before but with my primary male caregiver which is my father.

My father and I lived alone in the province while my mom worked here in Manila. My father would physically abuse me and verbally abuse me whenever I failed my quizzes, my exams, I get a lower ranking at school. (Nothing sexual ok)

I would always go to school with bruises underneath my uniform. My aunts and cousins knew but whenever they would make sumbong kay lola and it would reach my father, he'd beat me some more. After the beating, he would then hug me and wipe my tears and tell me he wouldn't beat me if he didn't love me and that this was tough love. He said, it's not love if I don't get hurt because I needed to learn.

Anyway, I guess that's why despite the blatant verbal and emotional abuse by my ex, I still stayed.  Because after he hurts me, he also comforts me afterwards and tells me that it's tough love and I need to be stronger.

I both loved men who hurt me because they said they love me.

Wala I guess, it just makes sense.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1c3wrl9/childhood_trauma_affect_adult_relationships/,t2_ogu7uvki,2024-04-14 23:54:36,4,1
walang kwentang panganay,"hi! i'm the eldest daughter of our family. i was physically and verbally abused since i was a child. my father started abusing me when i was 3 and only stopped when i started working because ""malaki na raw ako"", siguro somehow i was able to earn a little bit of their respect (for them to stop beating the shit out of me). after being physically abused for so long, sa younger brother ko naman ipinasa. seeing him being abused verbally and physically triggers me A LOT. i hate how i can never stand up for him. alam ko na dapat may ginawa ako to stop my father kapag nakikita kong sinasaktan siya pero it triggers me talaga to the point na i'd start to feel dizzy, shake, and nahihirapan mahinga (which i always always try to hide kasi baka masabihan akong oa ako). it's the same reaction every time i hear my father's loud voice, kahit pa masaya siya, or sadyang lumakas lang boses. since alam kong di ko nagampanan yung responsibilidad kong protektahan kapatid ko, i always try to comfort him patago. natatakot ako na kapag kinomfort ko siya harapan eh pareho kaming saktan. i try to make him feel na mali ginawa ng papa namin and whatever he's feeling eh valid. 

yung sahod ko hindi sapat sa pang araw araw dahil nauubos kakacheck-ins ko sa hotel makatakas lang ako sa toxicity nila at magkaroon ako ng peace of mind. maximum of two weeks na kaya kong itagal na hindi nag ccheck-in. katagalab kasi, naoout of focus na ko dahil di ko talaga mafeel ever na makapagpahinga sa sarili naming bahay. 

i have been planning to move out dahil naisip ko mas madadalian ako kung yung pang check in ko eh pinang move out ko na lang sana. kaso natatakot ako sa sasabihin nila. hindi ako yung ate na monthly nag aabot ng pera. i started working when i was 17 years old, paid for our internet + my tuition for college. every weekends i try to treat them ng food kahit 18k lang sahod ko that time. now that i'm earning 24k, mas nahihirapan na ko mag abot dahil sa pag ttry kong makakeep up sa school, andami ko ng utang na i'm still paying for + internet ulit + 2.5k monthly para sa 50k na utang ng parents ko sa tito ko.

so hindi ako yung ate na nakapagpagawa ng bahay, nakapagpaayos ng bahay, nag bbigay ng 5k monthly. i only contributed little things like food, minsan damit ng mga kapatid ko, minsan needs nila sa school, but not all the time. 

i feel like di ko pa deserve mag move out dahil wala naman akong naiambag sa pamilya namin, wala pa akong kwenta. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1c4uk89/walang_kwentang_panganay/,t2_vg6r4sy7h,2024-04-16 03:07:40,1,1

Today, we had our first face-to-face (lol) intercourse and in almost every thing he does he asks ""okay lang ba?"" ""Okay ka lang?"" He even told me ""hindi natin ipipilit kung masakit"".

I’ve been independent for 6 years and dapat kaya ko na to. Dapat im just focusing on improving myself pero whenever I look in the mirror I dont like what I see. Nandidiri ako sa sarili ko. I feel unlikeable.

my lola's friend caused someone's death.,"pa rant kasi parang ang hirap i-sink in yung mga nangyari. Mahaba 'to kaya please bear with me (pati na rin grammar ko, kasi indi ako magaling mag tagalog because I'm from Visayas)

So my Lola, (a teacher, retiring next year, and kapatid ng mismong Lola ko) has a friend which is a principal teacher sa isang public school dito samin. I met her many times before — sa mga parties and dinner with subject teachers. Okay naman siya. She's nice and has good communication skills. I prefer her over sa 'bestfriend' ng lola ko na mala karen ang attitude.

Not until I heard sa radyo (2 days ago) na there's a maid. A 19 years old, who committed suicide. And I was shocked nung narinig ko name ng amo niya. It was my lola's friend.. the principal teacher. I thought nagkamali lang ako ng rinig.. but it was really her.

The girl committed suicide because she wanted to attend college but eto naman si misis principal.. she said awful things to her simply because she doesn't want the girl na mag-aral and umalis. She even threatened the girl na sisirain niya yung card niya in front of her and she will call the police to accuse her of things na nawawala sa bahay if talagang aalis siya.

And you know what's worse?

She cursed the victim, saying awful words directly at her na she will always be a maid and graduating college doesn't suit her, dahil belong daw siya sa bundok where her parents work as magsasaka.

I was stunned to hear this and akala ko baka gawa gawa lang ng mga witness but there's a video of it. A fucking video of them talking. I don't know kung nasan yung video but I heard sa radyo na they watched it— and they were so mad at the principal teacher for causing someone's death. Not because of physical abuse, but mentally, and emotional abuse.

At eto pa ha, her salary every month is 3k lang?? and yung cheap rice pa yung pinapakain sakanya. Minsan saging lang. Tapos sometimes she's asked to iron the clothes daw ng amo niya every 12AM-1AM like what the fuck? The principal teacher is fucking rich. Her husband and daughter are fucking lawyers yet ganyan yung trato sakanya?! how inhumane!!

The girl opened up to her boyfriend and messaged him na she will end things as she don't see any future na daw because of what misis principal told her. Her boyfriend rushed doon sa bahay where she's working. Her boyfriend found her hanging but she was still alive..

However, she didn't make it. When she was at the hospital, she was choking na daw which caused her death..


I don't know what and how to react.. but damn this is just so..

Hay, rest in peace.. shit the victim didn't deserve that : (((

Nakakalungkot talaga and I feel so sad sa nangyari. Sobrang naiinis ako kasi I used to admire this principal yet to know na eto yung nangyari? Gosh, she did not only kill the girl.. but the victim's dreams na maging isang ganap na teacher din and for her family.

Potangina talaga. I hope the family will get the justice they deserve : ((


EDIT: I apologized for using the word 'owner' instead of 'amo' pasensya na po talaga and thank you so much for the correction...

I hate myself ,"I grew up with a complete family but mentally broken. We never talk about our personal lives, but we have verbal abuse instead, no any physical touch or bonding, physical abuse lang.

I was financially supported by my lola in my school and personal needs.

Elementary, ako lagi yung bata na walang parents na kasama sa mga events and field trips even sa contests, ako yung bata na walang family na manonood for me. I even make my own props for those contests. Never akong nakaranas na icecelebrate ng bongga yung birthday ko, graduation, or even winning in a contests. I even study by myself. May times na kinalmot ako sa mukha ng nanay ko and it was very visble and I had to lie sa classmates ko for it. 

Graduated and even, sinumbat lang sakin na pera ng ate ko ginamit to buy a food for me to celebrate my graduation kahit we ackwardly eating in a resto for the first time but only with my mama and papa without my siblings. Di din kami nag uusap ng mga kapatid ko, more than 10 years agwat ko sakanila, they have their own family now.

Highschool, verbal abuses turned me being bobo kahit achiever, malandi kahit nbsb, at walang kwenta. Attended a wedding with my parents and a relative asked for my age, my father got it wrong. They even threatened me na wag na magaral kahit di naman sila sumusuporta sakin. Kaya i did not invited them to my SHS graduation. I did a post thanking my relatives who’s been there for me. My parents were angry for that. 

Ngayon in college, 3rd year na ‘ko and I grew a lot of hate towards them. Naiirita ako when they are trying to be nice. Naiirita din ako pag nakikita ko sila, being in their presence, irritates me. I plan to be an attorney since lumawak yung empathy ko sa kapwa since I grow up experiencing injustice in my own household but I hate myself that I have less for my own parents. Pag nagagalit naman sila sakin, mas lalo ko silang iniirita. Di ko ineexpect na aabot ako ng 21 y/o, elementary palang ako gusto ko na mmt4i. andami ko nang attempts pero never got it well, minsan iniisip ko sana mauna ako para di ako mag regret pag nauna parents ko. and I hate the most na eto ang thoughts ko, ansama sama kong tao.

It's my first time hearing my partner sing her heart out after 2 months,"Mahaba haba to, your choice if babasahin mo :)

I'm 22M and my partner's 21F, we're both living with my parents. Everything's all great, it felt like I'm living the dream. Parehong may savings, nabibili namin lahat ng mga gusto namin, and of course, nakakatulong din kami sa bills dito sa bahay. She was 19yrs old when we decided na mag live in na, given the fact na sobrang abusive sakanya ng mga tao sa bahay nila (verbal and physical abuse), nagka trauma and depression siya that time so I told her na whatever her decision, my family and I will welcome her sa house namin. We both earn 30k monthly since nasa parehong company lang kami.. 

But then, March 28, we lost our baby. She was 3 months pregnant at that time. She wanted to quit her job so I let her be, she needed time to grieve, to breathe, and to heal. I know I do too but, she's my first priority. It's very heart breaking BUT we can always make another one. That's when she started to be quiet. No words. No reactions. Barely eating. Ni hindi kami nag uusap ng matino, just pure presence is all that we have that time. Hindi siya lumalabas ng bahay. Hindi niya rin kinakausap mga friends niya and kahit sino dito sa bahay. She ignored us for 2 months. Some may say that she's unfair and that she never thought of how I would feel sa ginagawa niya. Na hindi lang siya ang nawalan.

Pero kahit na hindi siya nagsasalita, or kahit na hindi niya ako kinakausap.. Palagi niya akong inaalagaan. Nauuna siyang gumising sakin ng 7PM para gawan ako ng breakfast (gy shift ako), after that, papainitan niya ako ng tubig kasi hindi ako nakakaligo pag hindi maligamgam yung tubig. Pag break ko, may snacks na nakahanda sa table ko, and then pag lunch ko naman, hinahatiran niya ako ng niluto niya for me. Lahat ng foods na ginagawa niya for me, laging may sticky notes sa ilalim ng pinggan: ""Thank you so much"" ""I appreciate you"" ""Wait for me"" ""I hope it's spicy enough for you, di ko tinikman kasi baka it's too spicy for me"" ""Hipon, your favorite!"" ""With every bit of fiber in my body, I love you"", iilan lang yan sa mga nakalagay palagi sa note, never siyang nakalimot na iremind ako na kahit ganon siya sa ngayon, mahal na mahal niya ako't inaalala niya ako. 

Kanina after shift, habang naliligo siya, bigla akong naiyak kasi narinig ko siyang kumakanta. After 2 months. Paglabas niya ng CR, nagtataka siya kung bakit ako umiiyak. Niyakap ko lang siya ng mahigpit. She thanked me again and told me how much she loves me. While smiling. God, I love her so much.

Big thanks to all of you! Bago ko pala ipost to, nagsabi muna ako sakanya if pwede ko bang ishare yung pinagdaanan namin. Pinakita ko sakanya yung mga comments niyo kaya natuwa naman siya 😄

"My co-parent is a huge fucking piece of shit, and it took me three years to fully realize it.","Before I got into a relationship with my co-parent, I dated two other men who cheated on me and physically abused me. Though he didn't cheat on me, we still didn't work out because of his retroactive jealousy issues (my body count was a little higher than his), which then made him verbally abusive towards me. The emotional abuse got so bad that I resorted to self-harm, and all of this happened to me while I was in my first trimester of pregnancy. He also treated me like shit for getting pregnant and encouraged me to abort my son many times because it's bad for his career (as if he had any lol), and went as far as accusing me of making pikot because he comes from a political dynasty. After our failed engagement, I stayed away from dating because his words really cut deep, and I have completely lost my confidence in putting myself out there. During this time, I kept on blaming myself for all the shit he put me through, thinking that I deserved it because I chose to keep our son. I even told all my friends that he was the best partner I've ever had because unlike the others, he didn't cheat or physically harm me.

Thinking about it now, it was so fucking disgusting of me to rationalize what he did. I was a 22 year old girl then who was lost and suddenly plunged into parenthood, and instead of being kinder, he put me through so much. He shouted at me a lot in my own house, then called off our engagement on the sole reason that his brods think I'm a gold digger (idk where this came from bc he was basically unemployed for three months and I shouldered all his expenses then).

I got extra triggered today because he visited my home to meet my son, and he had the audacity to tell me I was not a good person. What a fucking piece of shit, I solely took care of my son for the past three years we were separated whilst he was busy chasing empty career promises of his brods. While he's sleeping sound, I was up taking care of my son then heading to work without sleep for 3 fucking years. Tapos ako pa yung hindi good person? Hahaha putang ina mo, T***. I hope you get what's coming to you, gago ka. Matapos ko lang 'tong masters ko, gago tatanggalin na talaga kita sa buhay namin ng anak ko.

I think what further solidified my long overdue anger is that I currently have a suitor now who is exerting so much effort for me, and is treating me so well. Despite his demanding schdule at work and in grad school, he visits me in a heartbeat when I need emotional support. Whatever free time he has, whether it be an hour or a day, he does his best to allot most of it for me. He treated me to nice dinners for no reason aside missing me. He really showed me that all my life, I settled for the bare minimum. Salamat na lang at hindi na ulit mangyayari 'yon, because I finally know what it's like to be loved. Whether we work out or not, I'm glad to have finally known my worth.

So TL;DR version: Tangina ng ex kong verbally abusive pati brods nyang makakapal ang mukha, and also that abuse isn't always cheating or physically beating. Often, it comes in the form of verbal and emotional abuse. Eitherway, we shouldn't settle for any when there are billions of people who are willing to give us so much more love.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1azyi8l/my_coparent_is_a_huge_fucking_piece_of_shit_and/,t2_ulxerfe3z,2024-02-26 04:49:00,7,0
(28F) Napakahirap growing up with an abusive father.,"The violent and sudden angry outbursts I witnessed since I was a child, yung mom ko battered wife due to his paranoia (napaka seloso), nakatikim kaming magkakapatid ng physical abuse kahit walang dahilan para ikagalit niya. Noon inisip ko tuwing ma tri-trigerred siya maging violent na sana mas mabuti pa walang ama kaysa ganoon, noong nilayasan namin siya ilang beses hindi na sana nakipag reconcile mom ko everytime na susuyin niya kami for the sake of not being called ""a broken family"". Eh di sana happy kami na wala siya sa buhay namin, may freedom from emotional harm at wala ng source of misery.

Ang hirap magmahal ng magulang na nananakit pag nagalit.,"-TW: physical abuse- 

Hello, quite personal rant here. I just find it hard processing what I feel rn. My Dad kasi has a tendecy na maging physically abusive pag sobrang nagalit. He also has a short temper din. Before, back in 2021, we had a huge argument (I was 19/20 noon) and it ended up w him getting physical (dragged me back into the house by the arm; strangled me in attempt to shut me up). Looking back, I know I had a sharp tongue. Pero it was all pent up, all the frustration and anger I felt towards him just exploded at that time. Having him around the house when he gets back home from work (which is every 2 months; he works abroad) is like walking on eggshells. Things were said and done. I was young still, and I did not know how to process how I felt. I still don’t now but I try not to go head-to-head w him anymore. 

Pagkamagagalit na sya, at feeling ng Mom ko mamimisikal na sya, she tries to interfere. She would put herself in between me and my Dad, or tell both of us to stop. Walang ibang magawa si Mommy kasi baka siya naman ang saktan, o di kaya magmukmok si Dad at isipin wala syang kakampi. My Mom just tries to stay in between.

After the first time he got physical w me, I thought na mali yon. Na hindi ko responsibilidad ang reactions nya pag magagalit sya. My Mom said na he only got physical because I did that to him, ang managot etc. For a very long time, I believed this. Initially, I did not. I believed that no matter how angry you are, you wouldn’t get physical w anyone. Especially family. 

Pero ngayon, we just had an argument recently. Noong una hindi naman talaga sya ang may problema ako, sa Mom ko lang. But apparently, naapektuhan daw sya kasi di kami naguusap. Ang Dad ko, pag mangsisita, parang laging on a high horse. The way he talks nakakatick off talaga. I think that was what set me off, kasi ganon ang pagsita nya sakin habang nakain ako magisa. Di ko napigilan (at mali ko yon) na sabihin na bakit naman ganyan sya mangapproach, and that kay Mom ako may problem hindi sa kanya. Suddenly, malaki na ang hugot nya. Bakit daw parang ghost ko lang sila tratuhin, hindi na ako nagkkwento sa kanila, etc. Para saan pa para magkwento, kung ang comment nya lagi sobrang nakaka-off? When I went to Graphika noon, nangamusta. Sabi ko ok lang, tinanong may entrance fee raw ba. Di na lang ako sumagot kasi alam ko mag c-comment syang “Mahal naman.” or makikita mong ij-judge ka nya sa facial reactions nya. What do you call comments like that? Sly comments or unnecessary side comments? Something like that. Laging may kuda na sobrang unnecessary. Nandoon sya sa generation na naninita ng pagbabago sa physical appearance (esp weight) at mga financial decisions ng iba. 

Siguro kaya malayo na rin loob ko sa kanya. Gets naman na nagt-try sya, sabi ng Mom ko. Bigyan lang daw ng time na magadjust kasi nga madalas namang wala sya dito sa lupa at laging nasa dagat for years already. Okay, pero hanggang kailan ang adjustment? Isang dekada na mahigit na ganyan ang set up namin, wala talaga. 

Ang hirap mo mahalin Dad. As a provider, thank you nandyan ka. Pero bilang tatay, nahihirapan akong mahalin ka. Hindi ko alam kung manifestation ba to ng trauma ko sayo. Pagpinapalo mo mga aso natin kasi sobrang ingay, naalala ko pagiging namimisikal mo. Hindi ka naman nagbago. All this time, I thought I was over what had happened between us before. Pero hindi, ang hirap mo pakisamahan. Sana hindi ka na lang naganak kung may anger issues ka.

I think I hate my younger sister,"Long rant ahead.

Tldr: I can't endure my physically, verbally, financially abusive 3rd grade sister anymore.

I'm already fed up. Gusto kong isurrender na lang namin siya sa dswd. Pagod na rin akong pilitin parents namin na ipaconsult siya pedia. Hindi ko na talaga kaya. Pasaway din ako at ng brother ko noon but it's bearable like normal kids are, our sister is literally hell. 

We already did several methods. Kahit pagsabihan nang mabuti, pangit pa rin gawain. Our parents does gentle parenting on her, however they are strict too at pinapagalitan siya when necessary. My brother and I naman are very strict with her naman, nauutusan pa namin siya minsan. Me and my brother grew up decently, I don't think parenting method ng parents namin ang problema. I think yung sister talaga namin. 

Physically abusive siya. She once hit my brother with a wooden block on his face, his nose bled pero nakarecover in a few days. She also threw scissors at me tapos inakmaan pa akong saksakin ng kutsilyo buti nakailag ako. Kahit small jokes lang like di masarap ulam mo. Kapag nagtatabi yung parents namin o malapit ako sa tatay namin, nagwawala siya. Suntok at sipa inaabot naming lahat. Kapag nasa labas sila ng nanay ko at di niya nabili gusto niya o nairita lang siya, ganun din, sinasaktan niya nanay namin kahit maraming tao. 

Verbally abusive. Lahat na siguro ng mura nasabi niya sa amin, kahit may ibang tao. Kapag nag-aaway o harutan lang kami, minsan sinasabi niya ""ah patay na mama niya (referring to my grandma"" sakin. Sometimes she even wishes mawala isa sa amin kung kanino man siya galit. 

SHE'S A FINANCIAL BURDEN. Last week, nahuli siya ni nanay/teacher niya na nagpapasulat sa classmate niya, binibigyan pa niya pera yawa. Kami na nga gumagawa assigment niya minsan kasi nagmamakaawa na nanay ko. Yesterday, pumunta si nanay sa school nila kasi since grade 1 (grade 3 na siya) laging may nawawalang gamit. Halos araw-araw kasi kaming bumibili ng lapis o ballpen niya. Minsan colors, gunting, at ruler. Sabi raw ng teacher, nahuli daw niyang pinipilahan ng classmates niya, namimigay daw ng pera (I assume pati gamit na). Her baon ranges from 50-150, depende sa kanyang s@lt!k (sorry for the word). Hindi pa kasama roon meryenda niya lunch at pag-uwi. Minsan hindi na kaya ng nanay ko kaya pinagbigyan niya minsan, may times na nahihighblood at nahihilo na lang siya. Daig pa niya college student na brother namin. Eh 5 minutes walk lang school niya, madalas laging hatid sundo. Kasama pa nanay pumasok, siya na nga nagpaligo, nagdamit, nagsuklay, etc. Pati pagtapon ng basura hindi niya magawa, ang dumi lagi ng ilalim ng sofa at higaan nila nanay. Kapag nagsosolo siya maligo sobrang sayang niya sa tubig at shampoo. Minsan nababasa na kusina na namin, akala mo may nagleak na pipe. 

Pag-uwi ko kanina from a trip, kalahati na lang yung 1 LITER shampoo na kakabili ko lang last week. Isang araw lang akong nawala. Last time I checked around 50 ml lang bawas nun kasi di kami masyado nagshashampoo sa bahay. Nagalit pa ako kasi I suspected my brother na binaon niya sa gala niya, pero hindi raw siya since may binili naman akong sarili niyang shampoo (I forgot sorry aken bro). Tnginnaaaa. Kaya kinabahan na ako.

I inspected my sister's bag, ayaw niyang ibigay. Nakipag-agawan pa talaga ako. I saw the brand new ruler broken, half na lang siya, and five bottles of my Victoria's Secret perfume which costs around 10k each. I received them as gifts from relatives and treasure them. My brother and I uses them since my parents don't like them. Pati yung pabango ng nanay ko, kung saan-saan niya iniispray. Hindi naman niya ginagamit sa sarili niya.

Madalas din namin siya mahuli ng brother ko na kumakalkal sa kwarto namin, di namin nalolock minsan o kaya nasa bahay lang naman kami. Coloring materials, wallet, pabango, damit, make-up (ginawa niyang pangkulay) madalas mawala. May sariling gamit naman siya pero kumukuha pa rin. Makasarili din siya sa pagkain. Di bale nang masira huwag lang mapunta sa iba (kahit kapamilya niya). O di kaya magpabili tapos hindi uubusin. Feeling ko hindi na ito kleptomania kundi GREED. Grabe. Sobrang sakit niya sa bulsa.

Hindi sa materialistic ako, very sentimental lang talaga sa mga gamit since galing sila sa importanteng tao at important occasions po. Hindi rin naman kami ganun kayaman para magwaldas siya ng pera. Our parents even had to loan for us to survive tapos ganito siya. I don't know what to do with her anymore. Nabibigay naman namin basic needs niya. Minsan pati wants if she behaved. 

I remember noong mga 3 years old pa siya, she would break all of my picture frames. Ipapakita pa niya sa akin tapos ibabagsak  niya mismo sa harapan ko. I even buy her pretty dresses when I'm out of town, but she don't seem to appreciate it kahit siya pumili noong nagvideocall kami nila nanay. One time I bought her an ukay jacket when I went to Baguio, I did not notice there was a broken sleeve loops kaya I bought her other clothes. I felt bad for her and I wanted her to have pretty clothes, only to end up disappointed because she only used them once and just dump them somewhere.

As a panganay I want to break down so bad. If my late grandma and parents didn't care for her, ibibigay ko na siya sa dswd or bahay ampunan. Kunti na lang masasampal ko na talaga siya hoping na magising siya sa katotohanan. Yung ibang bata hindi naman ganito di ko alam bakit siya ganyan.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1buy93r/i_think_i_hate_my_younger_sister/,t2_jao0ut8w0,2024-04-04 01:15:48,139,70
My ex bf who contacts me when he wants to fck ,"My ex bf contacts me everytime he wants to do it. I was with him for almost 4 years he was my 1st bf but I got tired of him always physically abusing me. Bruises were everywhere in my body. Namamaga talaga everytime he abuse me. I remember way back 2022 kamamatay lang ng grandmother ko and I am at the stage of grieving so yung attitude ko nun complicated I decided to go to his apartment for comfort and may konting misunderstanding lang samin then he just decided to hit me so hard because he said he was so tired of my attitude during that time sira yung bed frame niya then kinuha niya yung part nung nasira hinampas sakin. My body was so sore I could barely move I had to stay on his apartment for a couple of weeks to heal myself because I don't want his image to be ruined in my family.

Fast forward 2024

We already broke up because of other issue then now he always call me everytime he wants to do it cant stop myself from seeing him I also have my mistakes but he always tell me na he loves me and he is sorry for everything but ayaw niya na daw pero di niya daw ako kaya iletgo.. Do you really hurt someone you love? I am broken and confused.

BINUBUGBOG SIMULA BATA,"TW: PHYSICAL ABUSE 

Hindi kami naguusap ng kapatid ko dahil nabasa ko kung ano anong sinasabi niya sakin. Hindi ko siya cinonfront basta di ko pinapansin. 

Pag kaharap tong tatay namin nagiging mabait, pero pag nakatalikod demonyo na. Nagwala ba naman kahapon at binato mga gamit pati electric fan nung waa pa tatay namin.

Lumabas ako ng bahay para bumili, pag balik ko binugbog na ko. Nakasigaw sya agad habang ako sinasabi kong kalmahan nya lang. Yung step mother ko habang binubugbog ako ng tatay ko eh tinatakoan bunganga ko. Ending nadamay sya sa inis ko at sinigawan ko siya, sabi niya sakin ""Kaya ka nabubugbog eh"". 

Wala na kong ibang mapupuntahan. Ang dami ko pang gustong sabihin pero lagi akong nauunderestimate. Tangina for context 2nd yr college na ko, F 20. Simula bata binubugbog ako.

What if ibalik ko sa mama ko lahat ng pinaggagawa niya? Kaso...,"From Physical abuse down to emotional abuse sama mo na verbal abuse. Gusto ko siyang bugbugin pabalik, tawaging ""walang kwentang tao"" at paiyakin ng buong araw para naman maranasan niya lahat ng naranasan ko sa kanya bilang ina niya. For past 24 years, sobra sobra na ang pananakit niya sakin even for a minor mistake grabe na siyang manigaw tas sinapak ka pa. Naalala ko noong pinaliwanag ko sa kanya bakit naging 87 ang grade ko kaso bigla nalang ako sinampal at nagalit siya nung nacorner siya ng teacher ko.

Kaso dumating lang ang pandemic. Doon ko nalaman bakit ganyan siya.

Back in 1963, siya ang trial child nila lolo at lola dahil siya ang unang anak na babae sa pamilya. Dala ng religion nila, ang dami nang pinagbabawal sa kanya like typical strict parent rule. Idagdag mo nalang yung micromanaging ng lola ko mula household chores palang and pinarurusahan pa siya (corporal punishment) and pambugbog ni lolo. 

Pero ito na ang pinakamasakit na nangyari sa kanya-- nung pinagbuntis niya si kuya after niya grumaduate ng high school (16-17 years old) sinaktan muna siya ng sinaktan ni lolo hanggang sa tuluyan nang napalayas samin si mama kasama ng isa kong tita na never ko nameet hanggang sa namatay siya last year.

Decades later, nag reconnect sila lolo, lola maging si mama. Wala na kong naalala dito bukod sa napagalitan ako ni lolo. 

Nung Grade 6 ako, pinagtulungan akong saktan nila mama at tita (5th child sa walong magkakapatid) dahil aksidente ko nalublob ang sapatos ko sa baha and nung nalaman nilang Sgt. at Arms lang ako (for them, nothing is special on that position aside for being a tagabitbit ng upuan kada program). They don't take apologies, they don't take accidents. In their eyes, you intentionally ruined your school shoes and taking such a lowest position in your homeroom is a shame.

Mula high school until second year college (2019-2020 SY which halted due to pandemic) , binawal na sakin ang lahat--limiting all the interactions while nag aaral pa. Graduated and got shunned by my classmates post pandemic.

Back to the present, pati personal growth ko she tried to hinder it. Supposed na may work na ko sa isang BPO company bigla na kong pinauwi -- para lang gawing utusan at housekeeper sa bahay and she is no longer encouraging me to explore more opportunities. Basta as long na dito lang ako *dahil wala siyang tiwala sakin the way my late grandparents don't trust my mom back then*

Nung na orient ako sa mga cycles ng abuse, yung napapasa sa anak lahat ng dinanas nila before ay naranasan ng anak nila ngayon, I felt na isa ako sa kanila. Lahat ng frustrations ng magulang sa past nila, binabalik sa anak sa present. Inunawa ko siya at natutunan ko sa kanya ay kapag gagawin mo lang punching bag ang magiging anak mo, wag na lang mag anak.

It has been 13 years,"It has been 13 years since I told my parents that I was seeing then my boyfriend, now husband. It started like a normal day and then after breakfast I told my mother and stepfather I was seeing someone. I didn't expect just how extreme their reaction would be. I know they wouldn't be too happy because they were very strict. But I was 18, a legal adult who was leaving home for university in few short months so I thought that was enough for them to give some freedom. My mother went berserk. She yelled at me, cussed me out and called me a whore. She hurt me physically over and over. She threatened my life. My stepfather tried to play the nice guy by supposedly calming my mother. But I heard him egg her on. He asked to speak to my boyfriend to end our relationship. I was terribly frightened and helpless. Just after 9pm on that terrible day, I had to leave home and stay with a friend because my mother threatened more violence.

That was the start of their campaign of terror which lasted until the end of August when they eventually kicked me out of the house. I've always been abused in that house but they really ramped up the physical, mental and emotional abuse during those few weeks. I didn't even feel like human anymore towards the end. They've worn me down and I thought I was the worse person in the world. A dirty, good for nothing, whore of a daughter. 

Every year I feel the pain. As the months then the days approach to what I coined the anniversary, I am stuck in a cycle of reliving the pain. Some years I don't remember but when I close my eyes in the night I'm back in that moment. 

It has been 13 long years. I'm 31 now. I live in a nice house with the same man and have a good life. But every year, I feel like a helpless 18 year old again. My parents said I would understand their actions when I'm older. I'm still waiting for that day. The older I get, I feel more confused about their actions and their desire to hurt me. 

I feel angry because people in my world have moved on and expect me to do the same. I wish I can. I wish it doesn't hurt and that I no longer remember.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/158ams0/it_has_been_13_years/,t2_8epaki6q,2023-07-24 21:25:12,285,55

this guy is so different compare sa ex ko. lahat ng love language consistent binibigay sakin nitong current ko pero last year, we had a fight and dumating sa punto na sinaktan niya ko physically. hindi lang isang beses to at everytime na ginagawa niya sakin to nakikipaghiwalay ako pero ayaw niya akong pakawalan, possessive kumbaga. 

this year, hindi naman na nangyari pero sa tuwing nakikita ko yung mga scar ko naaalala ko yung ginawa niya sakin which encourages me to end the relationship. grabe yung trauma sis! also, may micro cheating din na eksena (saving and liking pics of other girls on socmed) the fact na isa siya sa pinagkwentuhan ko dati about sa reason ng break up (micro cheating) namin ng ex ko pero ginawa niya rin sakin. sakit.

For future parents,"TW: abuse

Sa mga future parents dyan, kung di nyo lang kayang mahalin at alagaan ang (o mga) magiging anak nyo, wag na lang kayo mag-anak.

Grew up in an emotionally and physically abusive family. I am old enough pero hanggang ngayon ang abusive pa rin ng nanay ko sa amin. Grade school pa lang ako she has been calling us names: tamad, batugan, walang silbi, patabaing baboy. Dad didn't know the  and couldn't do anything since he worked somewhere else. At kahit naman nasa bahay sya, di nya rin naman kayang pigilan yung asawa nya. Lumaki kaming walang respeto sa amin ang nanay namin. Yung baong binibigay sa amin, parang utang na loob pa namin. It was like money that we had to work/slave up for like house chores. Hindi pwede mediocre linis dahil ipapahiya ka nya kahit sa harap ng ibang tao kung may na-miss kang spot. Isang beses, i was beaten hard kasi hindi ko na-mop yung garage. Imagine an 11 year old girl being beaten with broom sticks, hangers, etc. My 2 younger sibs had it better. Nung time nila di na ganon namamalo yung nanay ko, pero the verbal abuse is still there. I admit, I am no perfect child. And I am trying to take the right path naman kaya nga ako bumalik sa school. Before I enrolled, tinanong ko sya kung okay lang ba. Pumayag naman sya, kaso alam ko naman sa sarili ko na kahit pumayag sya, once may f2f classes na di na sya magbibigay ng baon or pahirapan makahingi ng baon at contributions. Tama hinala ko. Katulad nung bata kami, ang hirap manghingi kahit pasahe lang. Di rin naman makaka-save dahil saktuhan lang yung binibigay nya. I tried to work part time kaso my course is demanding. Gusto ko na lang matapos to get out of 'her' house and her life. Or kung manalo ako sa lotto, bibigyan ko na lang sya ng chunk nun para sa lahat ng ginastos nya buong buhay ko tapos aalis ako at magpapakalayo. Di ko naman hiningi na iluwal nya ako sa mundo. Nung bata ako, akala ko ampon ako. Madalas iniisip ko nun kelan kaya dadating yung real parents ko para kunin na ako. As i get older, di naman maipagkakaila na anak nga nila ako kasi kamuka ko naman sila.

Kung magsalita yung nanay ko parang napaka-samang tao ko. I started to think of unaliving myself at 9 years old. Ngayong matanda na ako, di ko pala kaya pero tanggap ko na kung maaga akong kukunin ni Lord.

Hence, I grew up thinking it was normal to meet a guy who is a toxic masculine and misogonyst.

Mr. Bumble is the exact opposite. Open-minded, gentleman, respectful, and dislikes sexism/misogony. I asked him how his parents raised him and he said he never saw his father physically and verbally attacking his mom. Kapag may issue both parents, tatahimik lang and pag-usapan nang maayos. His parents never hit him physically as well. He said he wants to be honest to show how his parents raised him and nakikita ko naman. He also thinks his actions are normal for a guy and sabi ko sa kanya in my case, nagugulat ako kasi nasanay nga ako sa toxic abusive household. 

Sabi nga ng mama ko, mag-asawa ako ng lalakeng hindi tulad sa papa ko. I am glad my brothers are the exact opposite of my dad and they are similar to the guy I am seeing as well. I know bare minimum lang yon lalakeng respectful and mabait but I really appreciate it that may ganitong lalake pa pala aside from my siblings. Somewhat, my siblings are also reminder that not all men at toxic masculines.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/x16ssl/he_was_raised_by_loving_parents/,t2_jsk5ehoi,2022-08-30 10:09:36,85,19
Being Mean/Nice is A Choice,"Don't you ever dare to say ""ay baka hindi naman nya yon sinadya"" ""Maybe He/she didn't mean it"" NO HONEY, HE/SHE MEAN IT, everyone's aware of their OWN actions, stop excusing someone's behavior because of their problems.

There is one girl at my school who are constantly mean, spreading false rumors, and even talking shit about everyone, even her friends. 

Then one time me and this girl had a quick conversation abt life, and she said she is getting abused at home, and she's dealing with a tons of problems. Then i said to my self ""Oh maybe kaya ganon ugali nya kasi ganon environment nya"". So basically parang inexcuse konadin yung mga ginagawa nya because of her problems. 

when i came home, i looked in the mirror, and i realized na i'm getting abused as well in my home by my parents Physically hit, and Mentally. But i don't treat people like that, doesn't matter how bad her situation is, but the thing is her problems have nothing to do with her actions, She choose to act like that.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1alpx9h/being_meannice_is_a_choice/,t2_t5hm7vto,2024-02-08 15:07:43,40,21

karesperespeto padin ba ang mga sex workers??,"Hi guys I would like to open a topic since sobrang sama Ng loob ko and hoping somehow this story telling might help some girls or boys out there who suffer on the same circumstances as me. Hi I'm 18 yrs old and I'm a sex worker. 
 How did it begun?I was a streamer on an app when I was 16. Galing ako sa break up with my first boyfriend. I made the decision since he ask me if I wanted to do porn. I was very much offended at that time and somewhat close minded. But I know that time that my worth is more than that. Time has passed and there are lot of things in my mind but I decided to keep on going. I did streaming and luckily earn money to it. Wala kaming wifi nambuburaot lng ako sa mga viewers ko for load. Syempre while streaming Hindi maiiwasan ang mga nsfw offers like sending of pictures. I felt pressured dahil expectation Ng parents ko is Malaki sahod ko. That upset me and push my self to stream non stop to the point na Wala akong tulog and ung pahinga ko sa cp is 3 hrs. Nakaranas din ako Ng pananalita while streaming. Nababato ako Ng gamit and nasasampal. Maliit lng bahay namin understandable pero ung pananakit nila and pag sigaw is kind of out of the league na. I have trauma when it comes physical abuse. Ung mother ko I think have suffer from post partum and lagi syang Galit sakin napapalo ako even small things. I felt not normal at the times. Akala ko I'm a piece of shit lng walang silbi and all of that. Back to the story, I tried to have worth and so work not to mention I have epilepsy. Nakabili ako Ng mga bagay na gusto ko and totoo nga Minsan nakakasilaw Ang Pera. Nung walang Wala nako nag start ako mag benta Ng nudes. Nung nakita nila na may hawak akong Pera medyo naging Mabait sila . As a daughter to them I sometimes give money to them and buy groceries pero Hindi namn araw araw pasko mag mga times na nga nga tlag and so I decided to be a walker or prostitute. Pumasok ako sa ktv sa timog and doon ko nakita na may mga graduate pala Ng 4 yrs course and nag end as prostitute dahil sa hirap Ng Buhay. 
My problem is my mother and brot5dont respect me anymore. Ung kapatid Kong lalaki binubogbog nalng ako at inaambahan while ung mother ko sinasabihan ako Ng napakadumi ko daw. I'm afraid to be treated like a shit eldest child the way how my mother treated her eldest sister and my father being treated by his younger siblings . So my question is is being a sex worker still deserve to be respected? Sorry guys nalilito na Kasi ako I was thinking to do suicide SInce ung family ko is treating me like a shit habang tinutuwid ko ung sarili ko",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/z518ha/karesperespeto_padin_ba_ang_mga_sex_workers/,t2_p42o1i01,2022-11-26 15:22:07,233,224
"Worked Incredibly Hard, Only to Lose Everything and be Called a Failure.","Already in my 30s, single, with a medical condition that needs monitoring, and soon will lose my job and business, and will be left with loans… And to top all of that, was told by my partner that they regret doing business with me because it was a failure.

I was called a failure because according to them, I let my emotions get the best of me… I was called a failure because basically, I didn’t have as much money as them to save the business… They blamed it on my materialism. 

At the same time, I am also repeatedly described as a slut by my ex (just broke up) for speaking to people online for a few days when I was lonely, when I was physically abused, when I was emotionally abused by ex…

I worked so incredibly hard… I guess they don’t really know because I don’t really tell them. I just work. The business was doing great in its first year. Second year, not so… I continued to work incredibly hard to save it on the second year but my partner wants out. 

Off my chest because… I am all over the place already… I just want to kill myself already. That’s how fatigued I am already… To work so hard and fail… To be at this age and still be nothing… As said by other people… I just worked so hard and for it to just… Crumble in front me… I am so traumatized to start on my own and handle a new business again… I am so traumatized to trust people and find love again… I am so traumatized to believe in myself again…",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1biawvv/worked_incredibly_hard_only_to_lose_everything/,t2_t3k4rk8r4,2024-03-19 11:39:49,0,1
Willing ako maging 3rd party para maka alis sa isang abusive relationship si crush,"me(M) has come to know a certain woman(F) at work let's call her crush, we just started at this company at the same time and throughout this period she'd disclose that her live-in SO of 4 months is an abusive narcissist who gaslights her on the daily.  


she's cried a few times during our mandated breaks due to this, she'd show me her conversations with her SO and it's just a mess of insults and accusations and this cycle repeats nearly everyday, we actually can't talk about anything else unless she's calmed herself down but we can talk for 3 hours on the phone without really running out of things to talk about. I am not the only confidant crush has with her situation as several co-workers of varying genders has been informed about it.  


for context about kay crush, pretty much a textbook abuse victim, I asked her if she has been physically abused and she's said her SO hasn't hurt her physically (doubtful imo). she keeps coming back to her abuser like most abuse victims do. Also has 2 kids from different fathers, and her current SO is actually trying to get her to have a 3rd kid. pretty sad situation in 3rd world philippines.   


from what I know  of her current SO, a 20-ish year old(so young) jobless dude who uses weed but is ""managing"" a family business I have no information about that also brings no money, this guy was crush's +1 on the office team building and he would frequently ogle my other female co-workers unashamedly in front of crush.   


Right now me and crush are pretty close and intimate(no sex, yet), to the point of her saying she wishes she'd met me earlier or getting jealous if I pay attention to other female co-workers and we are aware that this is cheating. I don't feel any guilt towards the guy, but my feelings for crush isn't healthy too, I want crush for myself but I can't make her dreams(wants a happy family with kids) come true because I'm planning to get a vasectomy this year and i'm not budging on my childfree ways.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/14oq1um/willing_ako_maging_3rd_party_para_maka_alis_sa/,t2_lv2me,2023-07-02 22:44:37,0,1
Nobody loves me and I’m such a failure ,"I apologize in advance for ranting heavily. Just need to get this out of my chest and mind. There are times that I just want to disappear from the world because nobody loves me and I’m a fucking loser and failure compared to my friends and cousins. Yes, I think of contemplating su***de more often lately because my life is a joke and full of traumatic experiences and memories. 

 I used to get physically, emotionally and mentally abused by my dad when I was younger. I still remember that time na hinabol nya ako ng kutsilyo and bitayin nya ako patiwarik. And also that time when he used to hit my head against the wall when I was in grade school. Tapos ung mom ko naman binubugbog din siya at natatakot kahit na magstand up for me. Tapos nung nagkawork na ako panay utang and naka-asa naman siya sa akin. I also used to be close with my brothers pero nung inuwi sila sa pinas ng dad ko feeling ko lalo lang ako nalungkot. May mga lola and lolo naman ako pero magmula nang nagmigrate dito sa Canada, I miss them a lot and it’s been 7 years since I haven’t seen them. Same with friends. 

Di pa nakatulong ung mga countless times na naging sawi ako sa lovelife. Halos lahat na ata ng pangit experiences sa lovelife na experience ko na. Physically, mentally, emotionally, verbally, sexually and financially abused tapos pinaasa, got cheated on, and lied to. Tapos ung mga pagcocompare sa akin to my cousin na kesyo siya nakatapos ng pag aaral, nurse na, may sariling kotse na, panay travel and may happy relationship with a canadian (afam) guy samantalang ako wala ako kahit ano nun. 

Diba? I’m so fucking pathetic and living a worthless life. Ano pa ba purpose ko sa mundo? Kung di lang dahil sa pet dog ko siguro kaya di pa ako namamatay.

Sister bonds really make me envious,"I'm so fucking tired of being the emotional punching bag. Growing up, I have always let my older sister be, I never tried to create a bond with her kasi lagi niya akong sinasakit physically even though i am five years younger than her. I was a kid, and still inintindi ko actions niya as my older sister. I thought we'd eventually build a relationship just like any other sisters I know once we get older. But no, it just got worse. 

i just want to know where does her hatred of me stems from? I've never been one to fight back, sinusunod ko naman mga utos niya, i help her out when she needs help. Pero bakit? Bakit ang laki ng galit mo sakin, ate? She'd go home from school, see something na hindi ko naman kasalanan and still blame it on me. I know some of you will say, ""The oldest child has it harder"" but is that really a valid reason for her to literally verbally and sometimes physically abuse me? 

I've grown to just accept na ako yung emotional punching bag mo, pero sometimes it still hurts, you know? Especially kapag si Mama na ang nagtatanong kung bakit ba napakalaki ng galit niya sakin.

My mother got her karma,"I've (20M )experienced my mother's rage and mistreatment all my life because she had married my father whom she doesn't really love. Hilig nya manumbat samin na she should've went to law school this and that but she didn't because my dad told her to take care of me and my sister whos 14 now because my dad was an architect abroad. Often times she'd yell at us when shes tired from work, doesn't cook dinner so I had to learn how to cook dinner, she has these dogs but doesn't feed them so I take care of that, I basicslly clean and man the house because she doesn't bother to do anything, all she does really is just go on the washing machine and wash our clothes and she thinks that it's enough household work for her. 
She's not a great mom and it took me quite a while to notice because I think she's using us as a way to get her accomplishments because she wants me to become a doctor and my sister to become a lawyer, she also hits us for doing bad at school like getting a 70% in an exam for me in College. Me and my sister basically faced all kinds of physical and verbal abuse from her, most notable was when she let me do a squat plank the whole night when I was 7 and even tho I wanted to pee she said she would beat the life out of me if I moved out of the plank so I ended up pissing myself, every time my sister and I tried to talk back or justify my actions she would force feed us chili peppers to shut us up and she doesn't care if she makes us cry or hurt us because dad doesn't know. There's many more but some are a bit private because they feel humiliating to tell even anonymously.
Just earlier this year I've told my dad about it and they're going through a separation, I also noticed that since december last year my mom has only been yelling and not hitting hs because she's gone weaker. 
The thing is she didn't get weaker from age, she got leaukemia, I felt like that was the karma she got for doing a bang up job as a parent. I feel guilty because I smiled when I heard her talking to a relative about it on the phone because that's my mother, but she's also been long dead to me because the thing's I've experienced as a kid.
I don't know if it's karma but I feel like my mom won't be living for long because she is really weak now, I just hope she has it in her to apologize, but even know in her weakened state she still talks to us like we're not her kids, still too much pride in her to apologize, frankly I'm just partially excited because I'll be having peace in my life for once soon enough.
I know I might seem like a bad child for saying this, I think I do care about my mother, but only because I don't want to get hurt when I don't follow her instructions immediately.
I guess I'm just happy that even though I have a shit mom, I have my dad that truly cares and listens to me and my sister.

Nauulol ako every time dominant yung bf ko,"My boyfriend is a very soft person. Very golden retriever energy, sunod sa gusto ko most of the time, napakalambing, napakahina ng boses, napakamahinahon, naiiyak over the littlest of things (like pag namimiss nya ako or hindi kami nagkausap for a huge chunk of the day kasi busy kami both) — overall, a big baby.

But sometimes, when he's being protective over the people he loves, he becomes dominant. Just like nung time na naging physically and verbally abusive yung LIP ng younger sister nya, tinrashtalk nya yung lalaki tapos hinamon nya pa sa suntukan. He made sure pa na his younger sister was safely removed immediately from the house they were living in. Sobrang touched ko noon kahit hindi naman para saken yung ginawa nya.

Today, nagalit siya kasi binabastos ako ng isang friend ko (let's call him P) but I didn't know how to respond to P kasi he's a VERY close friend of mine and sanay na ako na bastos talaga siya na tao kahit kanino. Parang part ng personality nya maging bastos. Sasabihan lang ako na, ""Joke lang yun"" when I respond with seriousness. In the past week, mas lumala yung kabastusan niya maybe because tinotolerate ko din tsaka dinidismiss ko yung inappropriate jokes nya as being part of his raunchy personality. I already expressed kay bf na ayaw kong ginaganon ako pero di ko alam how to respond properly talaga without harming our friendship. Sabi nya na siya na daw kakausap kay P, pero sabi ko na wag kasi I want to deal with it on my own.

Sinabihan ako ni bf today na, ""Wala kayong pag-uusapan this week or some time soon,"" tapos sinundan nya ng, ""I'm not asking."" If hindi daw titigil, siya na daw talaga kakausap. Sabi nya pa na 'wag daw talaga magpapakita sa kanya ulit si P (they've met several times before) kasi baka mabugbog nya daw. Ewan, naulol ako sa pag-command nya saken. Gusto ko nalang sabihin, ""Yes daddy,"" tapos lumuhod sa harap nya or kumandong sa kanya pero alam kong sobrang inappropriate non for that conversation kasi serious na usapan yon. I know I can do that on my own naman talaga kahit hindi nya sabihin, pero my feeling of not wanting to talk to P anymore was validated nung sinabi nya yon, kaya mas na-empower ako to stop communicating with P.

As someone who's been very dominant and independent all her life, nanibago ako sa feeling na 'to. Kasi all this time I thought I wanted someone na submissive saken, pero nakakabaliw pala when someone's being dominant over me. Ang sarap pala sa feeling na ikaw naman yung inaalagaan, hindi yung ikaw lang nag-aalaga palagi.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/13oo6e3/nauulol_ako_every_time_dominant_yung_bf_ko/,t2_9tsta101,2023-05-22 19:26:33,1390,214

toxic household,"punyeta. 

punyetang buhay to, wala na kaming ginawang tama. gusto ko nalang mag suicide, gusto na namin mag suicide para lang maparamdam sa kanila na sumosobra na sila. kaso ang unfair bakit kailangan pa namin kunin at i sacrifice buhay namin just so they can realize na hindi na tama ginagawa nila? 

verbal abuse araw araw. naturingan kayong honor student pero sa mga simpleng gawaing bahay ang bobo niyo. napaka baboy nyo. laging over the belt. 7 years na kaming ganto, wala pa ring bago, gusto na naming sumagot at lumayas kaso mahirap lang kami, hindi pa namin kaya mabuhay mag isa. napaka unfair kasi lahat nalang sinusumbat samin, kami nagpapa aral sainyo, puro utang na loob putangina, kapalit naman unstable mental health at suicidal thoughts. 

kapatid ko nagbabayad ng kuryente, wifi, at tubig, pension naman ni mama sa renta ng bahay. pero kung makaasta sila parang wala talaga kaming ambag ni singko. 

nagbigay sila ng gadgets sa mga kapatid ko only to restrict them from using it. kailangan mo pang magmakaawa para lang makuha mo or magamit mo cellphone mo, sana hindi nalang sila nag bigay jusko. kasi ang gusto nila lagi silang may power over us, it has always been like this for 7 years na. nagka trabaho na kapatid ko which is good pero hindi pa rin nila ma appreciate kasi feeling nila nag mamalaki na, kapag hindi naman nag treat o tumulong sa gastusin sa bahay sasabihin nagsasarili. ganito kami lagi, hindi namin alam saan kami lulugar. lahat ng gagawin namin may nasasabi sila, nakaka drain na sa totoo lang. 

isang mali lang dito o isang sagot lang sa kanila, nagtthreat na sila agad na lumayas na kami. napaka manipulative and controlling. 

simpleng bagay lang na kinuha yung cellphone para magamit sa paggawa ng assignment sa school,  muntikan nang ma physical abuse. hindi mo alam kung mag aaral ka pa ba o ano. ayaw naman namin mag rebelde sa school kasi alam namin na kami rin ang mahihirapan in the future. kaya kahit ang hirap mag aral, tinitiis namin dahil ayaw naming ma jeopardize future namin, ganiyan kami ka practical. 

grabe pano pa ba namin titiisin tong gantong ka toxic na household, sa totoo lang gusto ko nang lumayas kaso alam kong hindi ko rin kakayanin at kawawa mga kapatid kong maiiwan. 

hindi kaya nila narerealize na yung mga verbal abuse na ginagawa nila sa amin atsaka pang gagaslight nakaka apekto sa mental health namin? kailangan pa ba talagang umabot sa itthreaten ko sila na bawiin buhay ko para lang magising sila na tao rin kami? may nararamdam rin kami?

Im tired of being a nice guy.,"So many relationship ended up with me being second. I've met and dated many women, took most to dancing, courted and been in a relationship with a select few. Unfortunately all ended up leaving me(some even cheated). Gave them everything i could and loved them like their the only woman in the world. Learned how to do hair and makeup so i can relate. But sadly i learned the hard way that the phrase good guys always end up last is definitely true. Its hard to trust and go out there again. Sometimes i think it would be best for me to just be alone. They prefer someone that would just use and abuse them emotionally and physically.

I wish my sister an early death,"Pagod na pagod nako sa ate ko. I used to have a love-hate relationship with her pero now it’s just pure hatred. She was my first bully. Bata pa lang kami alam na ng lahat na malala talaga ugali nya, she used to be very physically abusive and now she’s more verbal but her being physical with me never stopped. I remember back then nung hindi ko na kinaya yung mga pananakit nya sakin nag sumbong ako sa my trusted adult pero nothing changed, instead she threatened me and called me “sumbungera”. The “trusted” adult didn’t even do much kasi miski sila mismo walang magawa sa ugali nya. She started providing for us kaya ngayon mas lumala na lalo ugali nya kasi whenever di nasusunod mga gusto nya, isusumbat nya lahat sakin. And the saddest part is i idolized her. I wish i could be as cool as her growing up kasi i guess you could say na i felt inferior besides her, i was insecure growing up because of her. She can carry herself to the point na pati mga matatanda kaya nyang sagutin and she’s an angel sa mga mata ng mga kaibigan nya or strangers. She was prettier than i was and mas matalino sya kesa sakin. That’s why i couldn’t stop myself from wanting to be like her. Kaya despite of endless abuse, i always defended her against the elders. Ang daming nag sasabi sakin na “close kayo ng ate mo naiinggit kamo ako” and i wish na sana ganyan nga yung case kasi for me, mas better na na hindi close kesa sa yung kapatid mo mismo yung bully mo. She always finds a way para ipahiya ako or to invalidate me and never even thought about apologizing. Never nya akong cinompliment for something that i worked hard for. Pero recently, i think i’m reaching my breaking point. I guess i’m not as submissive as i was tulad nung dati kasi the way she’s been treating me lately is more hostile than how it used too. She drove me to the point na yung suicide thoughts are being applied sa real life. Have tried many ways of ending myself pero would always wake up in bed alone, still in hell. Gustong gusto ko na umalis but i can’t kasi i’m a minor and tama nga sya, she’s my provider and wala ako ngayon kung wala sya. I’ve tried many things like asking for help and finding a job for myself pero nothing works.

Contemplating on leaving my deadbeat husband.,"We have 1 kid, (a toddler), and I a have a WFH job. My husband is unemployed. He has a business before but it went under. He has no experience working for a company because he said he doesn’t like having a boss. He hasn’t done anything to bring in money to the household eversince I got pregnant 2 years ago. This, and his attitude is causing me to feel resentment towards him to the point that I am contemplating on leaving him now.

I pay for all of our bills (food, groceries, electricity, water, internet, gas, baby needs). Heck, even car maintenance sa akin pinapa-sagot. Ang kinakainis ko ay lagi niya akong kinekwestyon saan napupunta ang sahod ko, kasi pag nagpapabili siya ng luho niya, hindi napapagbigyan. Mahilig mang-gaslight kapag di nasusunod gusto, silent treatment for a week, minumura ako kapag nagagalit. Wala na ngang ambag sa needs ng pamilya namin, may gana pang mag-request ng kung ano ano. Nito lang, gusto niya kong kumuha ng hulugan na motor na di naman kailangan. Di ako pumayag, at nagalit na naman nung sinabi kong ako na nagbabayad lahat ng bills, wag niya nang dagdagan ang gastos.

Sa akin niya inaasa pag-aalaga ng baby namin kahit nagwo-work ako. Siya, tulog hanggang tanghali. Galit pa pag ginising kasi naka-meeting ako at umiiyak yung baby. Minura ako kasi natutulog daw siya, istorbo raw ako. 

Ang ambag lang niya sa chores ay mamalengke at magluto. May work ako so di ko magawang umalis mamalengke at magluto. Lahat ng ibang gawaing bahay, ako gumagawa. 

Laging may masakit sa katawan araw-araw, literal. Pero walang ibang ginawa kundi mag-phone at magpuyat kaka-scroll. Naiinis ako kasi parang siya lang gumagawa ng problema niya. Pwede naman niya alagaan health niya. Pag sinabihan pa-check up, ayaw kahit may HMO naman dahil dependent ko sila. Pag di sinamahan, magtatampo, di raw siya marunong magpa-check up mag-isa. Feeling di inaasikaso. Pero ang sa akin, dapat mga ganung bagay kaya niya na gawing mag-isa. Almost 30 years old na siya, di pa rin kaya mag-isa?

Alam ko kasalanan ko rin kasi pumayag ako na magpa-kasal kahit may mga red flag. Mali ba ako kung pipiliin kong iwan siya at buhayin mag-isa yung anak ko?

Iniisip ko baka sabihin ng iba ang OA ko kung iiwan agad, hindi naman physically abusive. Pero hihintayin ko pa bang umabot don? Verbally abusive na siya sa akin. At nagsasawa na ako maging cash cow at yaya niya. Nag-asawa ako para may katuwang pero pakiramdam ko single mom ako dahil ako naman gumagawa ng lahat. 

Nagsabi na ako sa mom ko kasi lately hindi ko na kaya yung iniisip ko. Na-trigger to nung naospital anak namin at di ko maramdaman na pwede siyang maasahan kahit sa pagbabantay. Di niya raw kasi kayang makita anak namin na tinutusok, nahihirapan etc. Pakiramdam ko ako lang yung malakas para sa anak namin.

My older sibs are all migrating abroad and I’m left to care for my abusive dad,"I find it unfair na lahat ng kapatid ko are living abroad na and I am left to care for my abusive dad(58) who’s having a hard time walking pati na din sa 6 dogs namin. I’m the youngest of 6 and ung mga kapatid ko nagsipag asawa na ng foreigner. So dun na sila maninirahan lahat. And here I am, juggling my life with my work and small business making ends meet.

I’m not bitter or what, I’m glad they’re successful in their own ways but I am scared na di ko magawa ung gusto ko sa buhay. I want to move out of the house permanently kasi the house is a living nightmare for me. I remember my dad verbally and physically abusing me on that house ever since I was a kid. 

My dad haven’t worked since I was still a kid kasi umaasa sya sa grandparents namin and he’s an alcoholic. Every time na malasing sya, he would sometimes punch me and he even threw a chair to me. There was a time na iniintindi ko sya kasi baka dahil sad sya na wala ung mom namin. (My mom died when I was a kid due to cardiac arrest days after she gave birth to me. Pinagsabihan na kasi na di na sya pwede mag anak ayun). But I developed to not care sa kanya.

Now, I feel like wala akong choice. I’m left with an abusive dad na walang retirement plan, can barely walk and I feel trapped.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/12jrzvt/my_older_sibs_are_all_migrating_abroad_and_im/,t2_63b4n9pz,2023-04-13 00:43:41,10,10
I hate my boyfriend's fraternity. So. Much.,"I love my boyfriend so much but lately I can't stand his behaviour. His org, his fraternity, takes pride in their application process which involves psychologically hazing and hurling emotional abuse to its applicants. It also interferes with their acads which is already mentally draining to begin with. The whole idea is to break their applicants down psychologically, emotionally, and mentally so that they can see who can withstand pressure and will be worthy of joining their org. There's no physical abuse, but they are made to do physically draining tasks and military-like exercises. I know a lot of orgs do these kind of application processes, but that doesn't make it okay at all and his seems to be longer in duration and stronger in intensity than the average org. It's all so unnecessarily cruel. 

I hated this org when he applied, as I felt like it was putting so much pressure on him when he already had a lot of change to deal with. I hated to think that he was being shouted at, humiliated, forced to do tasks that he would normally be embarrassed to do; plus there was so much to do that it took away a substantial time that could have been used for rest or to study for acads. To the point that he would get physically sick from exhaustion. All in the guise of creating a support system and friends. 

Now that he's no longer an applicant, but a facilitator,  it's all so much worse. How could he be okay with shouting at his juniors? Making them do embarrassing, tiring, menial, and at the same time physically and emotionally draining tasks. To the point that some of the applicants break down or self harm themselves to cope with the pressure. How could he not see the hypocrisy of wanting to be each other's ""family"" but the same time hazing these people? I hate it. I hate knowing that he is capable of bullying, and worse that he can't see that it's bullying. He is justifying all of it; that it is necessary, effective. I hate the self righteousness of it all.

I can't hide my emotions (no poker face at all) so he can always tell that I am not thrilled when he tells me about his org activities. I am trying to be supportive and understanding so as to avoid possible arguments but I just can't yet control my emotions. Yet I can't be open about it as much as I would like,  how much I hate this org, because he LOVES this org. He LOVES this org so much. It is his support system and barkada. How could I possibly take that away from him?? 

So I am left to swallow my comments, my thoughts, and my judgement as often as I can stand, so we won't fight about it. 

Tonight however I feel like I might explode from frustration so let me get this off my chest, PH.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/162u822/i_hate_my_boyfriends_fraternity_so_much/,t2_i1n45wjls,2023-08-28 00:00:56,13,6
my bf is still seeing his ex gf behind my back,"I'm 19(F). May boyfriend ako, bago pa lang kami ng boyfriend. Mag one month pa lang kami next week. But, a few days ago may nag chat sa akin thru pm. She introduced herself as the friend of my boyfriend's ex. They told me that I should not tell my boyfriend about it. I asked her what's the problem. She told me that my boyfriend used to physically abuse her friend which is my boyfriend's ex. Hindi agad ako naniwala. I ask for proof first. So they created a group chat. Doon inamin sa akin nung ex niya na they still seeing each other. She sent me proofs, such as their pictures together and conversations screenshot. But the screenshots are a bit sketchy since all of it was cropped. When I ask her about the physical abuse, she immediately changed the conversation and told me that she is not ready to share about it. I respected that. She is very pushy with me, gusto niya malaman kung ilang beses kami mag meet up nung boyfriend ko. And when I told her that I don't wanna tell her anything. She got pissed off. Doon na nila ako inaway nung friend niya sa gc na they created. They keep on telling me that I should not believe my boyfriend. They are mad that I don't want to believe them. I confronted my boyfriend about it. He send me proof that the pictures are from last year. And he said sorry and that he loves me. When we had our first date my boyfriend warned me about her ex. That her ex girlfriend used to that everytime he is with a new girl. But ever since that day, I cannot fully trust my boyfriend. I don't want to break up with him, because I am already attached. I am convincing myself that maybe this was just a test to our realtionship. I've been crying myself to sleep these past few days because I am overthinking everything. I am starting to get paranoid and I hate that. I don't wanna be like that.

Told a student that it's okay if he does not come to school anymore,"
I'm a teacher. Now, I had a Grade 5 student named ""Nico"" (not his real name) na sobrang disruptive sa klase. Parang little version ng mga siga sa kanto. Mahilig maghamon ng away, mahilig gumawa ng mga kalokohan during class, and mag - ingay.  

So you could imagined how stressful he is during classes for teachers. Madalas ko siyang masaway at mapagsabihan.

Then kanina, while ihahatid ko na yung Grade 5 students ko sa gate ng school to be fetch by their guardian, he was being rowdy again sa classroom pati sa pagpila. 

I am stressed and tired kanina but I know it's not an excuse why I said these words, ""Alam mo, okay lang sa akin kahit hindi ka na pumasok sa school"".

Then Nico replied, ""Ayaw mo na sa akin teacher?""

Maybe it's my imagination but I could hear some sadness in his voice when we he replied to me. 

Then I suddenly realized the meaning behind my words that I said without thinking. And I thought to myself, what the hell am I saying sa isang 11 years old na bata? To think, I even know his history. 

Nico has been the problem of the teachers ever since pumasok siya sa school namin so I already knew him kahit hindi ko pa siya nahahawakan. His father is in prison for being a drug pusher and as a young child, he was exposed to verbal, physical, and mental abuse from his father according to his previous adviser. I've even heard that he was abandoned by his mother.

Kaya I really regret my words but I was not able to retract it or played it as a joke kasi talagang nablangko ako and the next thing I knew nasa gate na kami.

Maybe he'll forget the words I've said to him kanina, maybe it's really my imagination when I heard the sadness in his voice and he doesn't think it's a big deal. Nevertheless, I will assume he is hurt by it and I need to make amends with him on Monday.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/12kp24c/told_a_student_that_its_okay_if_he_does_not_come/,t2_vpj5hn4v,2023-04-13 21:22:59,267,83
I don't get it!!!!,"I don't get why people seem to EASILY throw their relationships away despite the shallowness of the fight/problem. Gets ko yung mga malalaking problema like cheating or physical abuse, ayun, talagang hindi katanggap tanggap yun.







Pero yung mababaw na away lang na kaya pa naman sana ayusin o pag usapan, sabay itatapon nalang yung relasyon bigla at maghahanap ng bago... yun ang di ko ma-gets. Pagdadaanan at pagdadaanan mo din naman sa ibang babae/lalaki yan. Lahat naman talaga ng relasyon may misunderstandings, eh. Ngayon, nasa sa inyong dalawa nalang ng partner mo kung gusto nyo patagalin o ipaglaban.







Natritrigger ako. My last relationship ended because of shallowness and selfishness. I didn't want to end it but what can I do? Gusto na itapon e. AYUS AYUSIN NYO MAKIPAG RELASYON PARANG AWA NYO NA. 







Para sakin, nakikipag date ka sa isang tao kasi potential syang asawa. Ano yun, pag kasal na kayo, onting away, hiwalay agad? Napaka hihina ng quality ng relationships ngayon. Otherwise, if you don't have a plan to marry that person, then just fuck him/her. Make sure lang na PAREHO kayong nagkakaintindihan sa set up nyo. GIGIGIL AKO!!!!




EDIT: I didn't expect that this post will have a different POVs and versions. When all I'm trying to say is that the relationship nowadays are so easily to end. Seems like everything became so fast paced. Others will break up without even trying to fix it. Everybody's patience became low. Some married people are here as well. Na imbis ayusin problema nila sa mga asawa nila, maghahanap ng landi sa reddit at sa ibang platforms. But who knows, baka nga talagang malala na. Thank you for sharing your POVs. I've learned something new. Also I was not trying to invalidate anything or anyone, never my intention.

Ang sakit na magwalk out sa isang toxic relationship,"Alam mo ung love mo ung person pero alam mo sa self mo na pag nafall ka ulit sa “promises” nq magbabago siya, uulit nanaman ung cycle ng emotional and verbal (sometimes physical) abuse. I decided not to accept ung pakikipagbalikan nya kasi sobra na kong nasaktan at napagod sa lahat ng effort ko na di naman nya naappreciate. Parang kahit anong gawin ko, mali, nakakainis, hindi enough. Ang sakit marinig

 Anyways di lang kasi ako makatulog kasi baka part of me nagguilty na kahit nageeffort naman sya recently eh ayaw ko parin. Kaso sa time na tintry nya ayusin nag away nanaman kami (take note di pa kami okay) so ano na????

Sobrang totoo pala ung phrase na “sometimes love is not enough” kasi kahit gano mo kamahal ung tao, mapupuno at mapupuno ka rin talaga. Siguro fault ko na rin kasi binottle ko lang pero everytime nagaaway kami before, lagi ko naman cinocommunicate ung frustrations ko pero it always fell on deaf ears.

Anyways sa mga katulad ko na kakaalis lang sa isang magulong relationship. I hope makahanap na tayong Peace pati narin sa partners natin. Sana magkapeace of mind na tayong lahat.

Off my chest,"I love my bf so much. Di ko na alam pano ko pa ieexpress sa kanya online haha. Lahat na yata ng way ng pagsabi ng I love you nasabi ko na. Di ko na rin maexpress kung gano ko sya namiss. Kada mababakante ako sa mga tasks ko naaalala ko sya at namimiss. Pano kasi sobrang sweet. Di sya cheesy pero sweet sya in a realistic way. Soft spoken pa at walang vices/ di nagmumura. 

Pag naiinis or nagagalit ako parang ako pa naguguilty kasi di nya naman deserve 😭.

He assured me agad tas he took me out for dinner and sinamahan nya rin ako manood ng theater show na gusto ko 🥹💖 nagluto pa sya ng packed lunch namin bago kami magmeet. 

May times na feeling ko bagong magjowa lang kami kahit 3+ yrs na. Siguro dahil ldr na rin

Pano ko naman di mamimiss kung ganyan? Ksksjsjsksksksks


Ps

I Came from a somehow verbally abusive household. Dati may physical abuse din pero nabawasan na as we got older. This affects my relationship now. Ayoko talaga ng nagmumura or sumisigaw pero may times na nagagawa ko sya. I dont wanna be like my dad in my relationship. Super saya ko na hindi ganun bf ko. Pero may fear na what if maging ganun din sya pag tumanda? kasi di naman daw ganun dad ko bago sila ikasal ni mama. Scary. Lagi ako may fear na ganun.

Idk how to cope with this,"
I (m19) a good son and a student. Like every parents could ever dream off. But still im not perfect human being. For background . So my aunty (F50) she got no kids just mainly her life revolves around helping our family and being a corporate slave for god knows since when she started being one. As we all expected from her. Shes really strict and got a high superiority complex attitude. To the point where i have to tell my friends i should be at home by 6 or else my whole family especially my brother whos the golden child.  (M23) i dont really care tbh who happens to be a controlling coward and a manipulator would be calling my ass off. He would mentally abuse by gaslighting me for not being a good son and mainly rebellious by staying late and lying. Well he do the same. For the side note. I go to my friend’s house just to escape from my aunt and mainly the household.He would sometimes physically abuse me for talking back inshort defending myself. Because he always been exaggerating about everything just to make sure he got it all right. I became not really close to all of them. I left my religion and open up to islam. they didnt support me but wanting me to die. I dont really know im so close from ending myself. I felt like i cant find a partner or be in a relationship. If my family would be like this.  They always say that ill be the one taking care of them once they got old and shit. Which i dont really like. I cant live up with this kind of thing. Idk for how long i can endure this because im so close to ending myself.

How I ruined my Ex's life for Getting with my Best friend,"**\[LONG POST AHEAD\]**

&#x200B;

First of all, I already know maraming magagalit saakin, perhaps because masyadong harsh ang ginawa ko. TW lang sa mga mambabasa, this post will contain sexual harassment, physical abuse, and religious CULTS.

SO, my first ex boyfriend and I began dating noon high school pa, precisely 8th grade. We dated for almost 4 years until niloko niya ako sa best friend ko. I'll call her ""A"". Noong una, sobrang perfect ng relationship. He was my first boyfriend and akala ko my last. I would say very low maintenance ako that time, tipong kahit hindi niya ako binibigyan ng bulaklak during Anniversary namin or Valentines, presence niya was enough for me. Naintindihan ko rin ang situation niya since noong una palang sinabi na niya saakin ""mahirap lang kami"". This is because Typhoon Yolanda severely affected his family (he grew up in Tacloban ) financially and naghirap sila. Prior to the typhoon his family wasn't financially stable na rin. So mas lumala lang ang situation nila, tapos madami pa sila magkakapatid. This explains why kinailangan niya lumuwas sa Maynila at mag aral. Matalino ang ex ko, like no joke. I studied in a well known private school in Manila, perhaps the whole Philippines pa. So to be a scholar there was a big deal. He excelled in everything, ma-pa sports or academics, which explains why na in love ako sakanya. I didn't give a single F kung mahirap siya, I fell in love with his intelligence, passion and ambition for success.

Fast forward to my 12th year of HS (4 years later),  biglang nagiba ang ugali niya when he entered college (he was a year above my grade level so nauna siya mag kolehiyo.). I was so confused and frustrated kasi 3 years consistent ang princess treatment niya saakin. He got physically abusive to the extent na wala na sa lugar. Pinapahiya niya ako in public, tipong sisigawan ako sa harap ng maraming tao. The first time he abused me was when sinampal niya ako. And not like yung mahina na sampal, but yung tipong FULL FORCE na sampal. Imagine, I am a 5'2 female and he's a 5'8 male na slightly malaman ang physique -- not to mention main sport pa niya in HS was volleyball. Sa sobrang lakas ng sampal niya I fell to the ground and nagka pasa ako sa face for one week. For most girls, the first thing they would do is makipaghiwalay, diba? Kaso, t4nga ako that time. He apologized and comforted me after this incident and nagsinungaling ako sa parents ko na natamaan ako ng bola sa mukha during intrams. I let it go because he apologized profusely and nangako na it would never happen again. But of course, it DID happen again. Multiple times in fact. I was 18 years old at the time pa.

Months later, I received a long message from him, stating na gusto na niya mag ""repent"" sa mga ""sins"" niya saakin. Nakipag break siya saakin. He joined a church, which I later found out was a cult pala. Sa cult na ito may ""quota"" sila, like how many people they could recruit to their church. They would get praised pag na reach nila ito. Dinamay pa niya ako sa kulto niya aaaah! And as expected, it was a living hell. In this Church you were monitored most of the time, dating was prohibited without the approval of the pastors and you had to take an oath na kailangan mo ibigay ang life mo sa church (ang reasoning nila is because Jesus did the same for God). Despite being in the church though, patago kami gumagawa ng indecent acts. The slightest physical intimacy was ABSOLUTELY prohibited but ginagawa pa rin namin sa likod ng mga sisters/brothers/pastors. Not gonna lie, at some point I was genuinely committed to serving the Lord, but it was so difficult for me to stay ""holy"" when my ex would pressure me to do indecent acts with him. Sobrang hypocritical niya, yung ip-pressure niya ako makipag talik pero the next day he would be preaching about staying holy until marriage. Like what the F! And yes, technically break na nga kami but I thought wala lang yon because he still treated me like his girlfriend.

Bob0 kasi ako, akala ko kami pa. Kaso, he started showing interest kay ""A"" and completely disregarded me. He began pursuing ""A"". *For context*, ""A"" was my best friend sa church. She was sweet, intelligent and kind. My ex met ""A"" through me and naging bff din sila because they go to the same University apparently. When my ex began pursuing her yung money na hinihiram niya saakin (but hindi naman binabayaran) ginagastos niya kay ""A"" for flowers and gifts. The audacity. Although, habang nililigawan pa niya si ""A"" saakin pa rin siya pumupunta, perhaps because of the uncertainty. As a T4nga, hinayaan ko lang. I thought if I treated him better pipiliin niya ako. Umabot pa sa punto na  nagmakaawa ako na ako nalang. *Wa epek*. When pinayagan na siya ng pastors to pursue ""A"" he ghosted me completely and avoided me in Church. Sa harap ko pa siya nag ""Will you be my Girlfriend?"" kay ""A"" at a special Church event. P0ta!  After niya ako paasahin, gawing sugar mommy and Fbuddy????

**Ito na ang exciting part**, I had so many mix emotions like heartbreak, frustration and anger. Mostly anger. Because I felt used and manipulated. So, sinabi ko kay ""A"" everything, that we were doing indecent acts, na ginamit niya ako, na kami pa when we entered the church and LEFT the Church. When I left the Church I gave myself some time off and decided to forget everything nalang. UNTIL narinig ko na my ex completely twisted the story and pinagkalat sa Church na I was the one pressuring him (huh?). Sa sobrang nandilim ang paningin ko I decided plotting a plan how I could completely ruin his life. Since pilit nag mamabait other sisters/brothers ko sa Church I would frequently message them, acting all buddy buddy, pretending na I am completely oblivious sa mga pinagsasabi nila behind my back. Praise the Gods my OG akong friend sa church (who eventually left din) na chinismis saakin na my ex sexually harassed ""A"". Hinalikan siya ng walang consent ni ""A"" and also pressured her frequently to do indecent acts. Their relationship went downhill from their because nag sumbong si ""A"" sa pastors. HA! I put this information to good use and pinagkalat sa University niya of what he did to ME and ""A"" (without uncovering our names). I anonymously posted sa Freedom Wall ng University niya and name dropped him. Like, name, batch and course pa. I exposed how he was an abuser, predator and manipulator. Inexpose ko rin ang darkest secret niya, na nanonood siya ng child hentai (which is technically child p, diba?). Nahuli ko sa gallery niya na he had hentai vids and pics of sexualized versions of child anime characters (like yung mga white blood cells sa Cells at Work anime). Alam ko, na b0b0 ako for letting this slide, but he reasoned na they were just drawings. Huh? Anyways, when the post gained enough attention I deleted it to cover my tracks. A week later, my ex's friend (who eventually became my friend na rin) informed me na my ex was being completely alienated in campus hehe. Receiving dirty looks, anonymous threats, and getting bullied almost. A month later nagpost siya sa FB na he felt unsafe sa campus and had to drop out and needed financial support from his ""brothers and sisters"" in Church. I know ang sama, but sobrang saya ko when I read that post. The thought na I had ruined his reputation sa University niya, relationship and Church ... sensational.

Also, if you're thinking about his family, I also took care of it. I told them everything via messenger na ginawa niya saakin and they were on my side. Sabi saakin ng sis ng ex ko (close ko rin) binugbog ang  ex ko ng father niya when he came home for Christmas sa Tacloban for being ""kahihiyan"" and for ruining his future. THANKS TITO ILY!

PS. Also, I know dapat I should have been the matured one and walked away nalang para walang gulo. Sabi nga nila, God forgives even the greatest sinners. Unfortunately, for my ex, hindi ako Diyos.

Mahirap ma abused ng babae sa Pilipinas,"My ex (now colleague) still harasses me kahit na ilang beses na akong nag plead na layuan na nya at tigilan na nya ko. Ilang beses akong nagmamakaawa pero hindi nya marespeto yun. Lagi nya kong hinarass sa chat/text at in person. We broke up for almost 6 months and she still thinks na kami pa rin until now. Guarding me with my every move. 

She's confronting or harassing me because:

1. Nagmamakaawa siya na maging kami ulit
2. She keeps saying na ako yung sinungaling at manipulative. 
3. Manunumbat siya sa lahat ng nagawa nya for me
4. Tinatakot nya ko na mag suicide siya pag di ko siya kinausap. 

I've been enduring that cycle repeatedly week for 6 months. Masakit lang sa part ko na she's making things up para mag mukhang victim and the fact na nagmakaawa na ko sa kanya na to stop confronting me everytime may relapse sya. Tbh, sobrang draining sa mental health and I can't seek for help Kasi I'm a guy and ang hirap i prove na I am verbally, physically and psychologically abused.

But she also hurts us when she gets angry. I hate how I am becoming like them. I'm literally trying hard to control myself when I'm feeling overwelming emotions because I usually hurt myself but this time I JUST CANT.... : (

My mom’s friend raped me,"

I was raped when I was 18 by my mom's friend, and when I was 20, I told my mom about it. My mom has been my trauma since I was a kid; she has physically and verbally abused me since I was a child because I think she  despise my father so much. So back to the topic I told her na I was raped nung 20 na ako pero ewan ko di nya ata ako pinaniwalaan and now I’m 23 and I accidentally open her account kase nagbakasyon sya dito sa condo namen ng husband ko and unang una kong nakita na magka chat pa din sila nung lalake na nang rape saken, all this time pala di nya ko talaga pinaniwalaan and super sakt for me kase pinatawad ko na sya ng buong buo sa lahat ng pambubugbog nya saken dati and I even support her financially until today kase may sakt sya pero kaht naman nung wala pa syang saket lahat lahat ng kinikita ko sa modeling and work ko napupunta sa kanila nagtitiis ako dito sa manila just for them ng mga kapated ko sa province, She never treated me as her daughter pala talaga lalo na siguro kung wala akont nabbigay na pera sa kanya . Sobrang saket talaga lalo na nasa kanya trauma ko , dahil lang talaga sa kapated ko kaya di ko sya kina cut off sa buhay ko naawa ako sa baby brother ko which is 9 yrs old pa lang kc nakikita ko din minsan na verbally abuse sya, gusto ko na ngang kuhain un pero di naman ako mananalo sa batas kase sya pa din nanay and half sister lang ako. Growing up without a father is really hard pero mas mahirap na lumakeng may abusive mom like her.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/18yfndk/my_moms_friend_raped_me/,t2_umv32oti,2024-01-04 23:23:35,105,0
I hate how co-GenZs friends reacted and looked down on my dream about being a good mother/housewife,"Idk if this is a right sub pero nakakainis hahahaha. 

I really don’t get the amount of hate I got from my friends when I told them na I want to be a housewife, be a good mother figure and create a cozy family pag napag-uusapan yung ganap sa sarili or plans in future sa catch up. Napatungan pa ulit when my friend screenshot yung repost ko sa tiktok which is vid about family, dating, marriage na nakacollage ganon. Ako naman medyo matagal ako mag check ng gc and grabe na flood na nung nakita ko. I know it’s supposed to be a joke to jump with but I was hurt. They be like, “Can’t relate”, “Hirap magka-anak teh”, “Yung pinaiyak ka sa nursing tas magiging nanay ka lang”, “Si **** puro repost ng ganyan.” 

Medyo na-off lang ako kasi I thought I’m already in supportive friend group since I cut off my old friend group last year. Ano bang meron? Ano bang masama sa pagiging housewife? Funny how most of them are self-proclaimed feminist but doesn’t tend to support their co-female dream, I mean I’m not being forced naman eh, I don’t get the hate ba’t pinagtatawanan eh choice ko yun. I want it. I WANT IT SO BAD.

I grew up in chaotic family, I don’t have a father figure, I was raised by my alcoholic and physically abuser mother (she died early) then passed on to my grandparents. I always envy people who have a complete family simula bata ako. May pangarap rin naman ako to be a nurse, I’m doing great sa academics but having a complete and happy family talaga pinakadream ko. Minsan natatakot ako kasi baka matulad ako sa mother ko, iniiyakan ko yun pag nag o-overthink ako sa future pero I know to myself na I will try my best to treat them like how ng grandparents treated me. I want to have children na mababatayan ko so they wouldn’t feel lonely. I want a loving husband. I want to be a supportive and loving mother/partner. 

Hayyy. It’s just so hard to expressed feelings like this nowadays kasi napupuno ng back flash. Please mind your own dream. If you think yours is superior, good for you but walang madaling pangarap. If you don’t wanna get married, have children, that’s fine but please don’t judge people who want to create one.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1ak4c8s/i_hate_how_cogenzs_friends_reacted_and_looked/,t2_t2o6wc46i,2024-02-06 15:33:46,78,36
Not sure anymore,"I’m in my mid-20’s already, and sobrang dami kong narealize from life to dating and everything in between.


Sometimes, I do question myself if I’m not enough for someone. I've had at least three exes, all of whom were short-lived.

1st ex (college days): 11 months lang kami, this was a mutual breakup because nagiging toxic na ang relationship to the point na I was mentally and physically abused.

2nd ex (dated him 3 years after my 1st relationship): 11 months lang din kami because he ghosted me, and then I asked him the night before our 1st anniversary, and he said he just liked the idea of having someone in his life, but he didn’t really love me at all.

3rd ex (the most recent one): it took me again another 3 years for me to try dating. We were in the talking stage for like 6 months, and then he courted me, and it felt like everything was right, not until he broke up with me because he doesn’t feel like continuing our relationship anymore. So we dated for a month, officially.


I even came to a point where I questioned myself and thought negatively. I am not actively looking for love,  and then when we really start dating, they really leave me at the most inconvenient time of my life. Yes, naisip ko na rin yan na baka hanggang gantsilyo lang din talaga ako until pagtanda, and also self-aware naman ako na I have my flaws or negative traits tao lang rin naman ako. But for now, susuko na ako.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1bmds33/not_sure_anymore/,t2_my6jqx73h,2024-03-24 14:03:30,3,0
My entry of ‘Abused by Ex BF’,"I was 18 when I got into my First Relationship. 2 Months into the relationship, we would cuddle and he would try to touch me. When I refuse he would gaslight me by saying “Anong masama? ginagawa din naman to ng ibang mga magjowa. Mas malala pa nga sila”

And then we started having sex after a year into relationship. Sinubukan ko icontrol kasi ayoko talaga but everytime I do, magagalit sya at makikipaghiwalay. Being the young girl that I am, I had no social life, sya lang yung friend ko and I can’t lose him.

I stayed in that relationship for almost 3 years. Ex bf ay walang pinipiling lugar, he would get a boner even in public places. I thought nakakaboost ng pride yon kasi wow ganon ako kahot emz
We couldn’t watch a movie without him asking to touch my boobs, or for me to touch his little longganisa. 

It felt dirty, ayoko na din ng amoy nung white liquid nakakagising ng trauma tf. We would do it in his car, his room even sa pool (masakit pala sa pool)

My last straw was when he forced me kahit na may sakit ako at pagod sa work (we often meet after work) Bitch slapped my nipples so hard kasi di daw tumitigas tf (at that moment I could feel malapit na ako magkadalaw so my breasts feels very painful)
Hindi din kasi ako turned on, I guess hindi gumana fake moaning 🤏

And then we broke up…. BUT STUCK NA AKO SA GANONG CYCLE

The next boyfriend was the same except the physical abuse part. Second ex would call me while he is at his work because he wants to jerk off (pampagising daw because he work nightshift)


Akala ko kasi normal lang, na ganon talaga. It took me a lot of years bago matutunang I don’t have to do it if i don’t want to. That I can say no without explanation. I am kinda-okay now, though there are times that I would remember how it feels and mandidiri ako sa sarili ko. Wala na akong balita sa kanila and I never looked back nung nakipaghiwalay ako. My new bf respects my decision not to have intimacy until we are married. I’m 28 now.

I already feel numb at this point,"TW: Physical abuse, emotional and verbal abuse

Hi Reddit.

I’ve been contemplating writing here, but I have a lot of thoughts right now and I just want to unload.
Kakauwi ko lang mula barangay. I tried to find out the best legal ways I can to file a case against my biggest abuser - my brother.

I started the fight tonight. Nagparinig ako na medyo malakas kasi for the nth time in a row, kinuhaan na naman ako ng gamit. I’ve had enough. We live in a compound, nakatira sya sa ibang unit, ako nakatira sa mismong bahay namin. After nya ako marinig, he came barging in with the item he stole and shouting “May problema ka ba?! May problema ka ba?!” then he grabbed me by my neck and threw me outside. I didn’t want to fight, I know that if he inflicted more damage to me, he’d be more in trouble, and alas, as I was trying to go inside the house again, he was stopping me. At one point he punched me multiple times that I lost count. I’m already numb with the pain. I have been hit by a baseball bat when I was 16 and a monobloc chair when I was 17. I’m now 30, but things haven’t changed.

While the commotion happened, my mom just watched. She didn’t stop my brother or anything, she just watched at the side. She just watched me being punched and kicked. I grew up in the same way. She wasn’t really the best parent, as she coddled my brother saying “away kapatid” lang yun, but I still love her. Even when she blamed me for being diagnosed with cancer when I was 14, I still love her. She said na magastos, at naiinis sya dun - I get her though, she’s the only one working in the household. My dad was an alcoholic, a gambler as well. My brother followed his footsteps. Thankfully, my lola helped me with therapy. Pero you know, what set apart my dad from my mom before he died? He actually defended me. He saw me getting hit by the monobloc chair from earlier and he defended me. Sadly, even if he was battling cancer that time, my brother picked up the broken pieces of the chair and hit my dad the same way he hit me, and things were peaceful for a time dahil pinalayas sya ng dad ko, kaya lang my dad died eventually and my brother used that “opportunity” to come back home.

We weren’t really on good terms ever since. He physically hurt me multiple times since I was 6. Verbally abused me as well. But what I can’t really fathom is the fact na nung pandemic, nung 2020, winithdraw nya yung buong retirement fund ni mama - nearly half a million pesos - and it was all gone. My mom didn’t know that my brother was getting all her hard earned money for months, pero eventually pinatawad nya, kasi nagdala ng pancit nung umuwi after nya makuha yung pera. Ako? I cared for my mom when the pandemic hit, even if nawalan ako ng income that time. I tried my best, but what did I get in return? I heard my mom say to me “Sana hindi ka na pinanganak, sana hindi ka na naging parte ng pamilyang ito!” when all I did was serve her canned sardines because that is all that I can afford.

I am numb at this point.
I have to get a medical examination later for my scars at sa mga onting bukol sa mukha ko.
My best friend heard the commotion, and recorded the audio all while it was happening. We have evidence.
But personally, weirdly, I’m stoic right now.

Para bang oo, binugbog ulit ako, pero it’s like “I’m disappointed but not surprised.” The only insult he can throw to me is “Ano lalaban ka? Bakla ka kasi!”

At the end of the day, I try to be the best human I can be. I volunteer for a non-government organization helping out people in need. I know that I am loved by my peers and that is enough for me. I have a job now that gets to sustain me. I have achievements under my belt that I never knew I could accomplish. Irregardless of my sexuality, I am living my life trying to help those who need it most, and the people who stand by my side, and I am happy with that.

He may hurt me outside, but he cannot reach the light I have inside.
As much as he hurt me, he helped shape who I am today.

A fighter.
A survivor.

And at the end of the day, I’m okay with that.
Ika nga, the best revenge is living your best life when your abuser is living (or gonna live) the life he deserves.

I’ll be okay.
I’ll do things the right way. I will fight the right way. Not through fists and force.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/191ssmp/i_already_feel_numb_at_this_point/,t2_jgbvr4tl,2024-01-09 02:58:08,46,0

"It is my late Pa's birthday, and I'm still resentful","My father died in 2014 due to diabetes complications (which is his own doing since he refused to take insulin even though the docs already advised him years before to consider). He was a chronic cheater - he got my mom pregnant and they're not married then. He cheated on her, and got the other woman pregnant too. The gap between me and my half-sibling were mere months. He had another child with the said woman and then he got my mom pregnant again (mom really has issues to deal with her own too, apparently). He had two more children after my sister with the other woman, AND CHEATED ON HER AGAIN, WITH ANOTHER WOMAN. That another woman also got pregnant, and he got twins - who were just turning two or three when Pa died.

Pa is an asshole, and he never been a good father to us. On my 7th birthday, my mom invited him to eat with us in a local Jollibee store. He showed up, but said he was in a hurry and merely THREW a fucking 500 peso bill on our table where we waited for him. He left without greeting me a happy birthday, my mom cried as we ate.

I cannot wish you a happy birthday Pa, sincerely - fuck you. Fuck you for all the trauma you gave me and my sister. Fuck you kasi kahit sa mga half-siblings ko tinraumatize mo sa iyong constant cheating, emotional and physical abuse. Fuck you at lahat ng mga kamag-anak mo na in-others kami. Taenamo, ngayon lang kita mamumura, ang sama pa rin ng loob ko kahit na sinasabi ko na pinatawad na kita kasi patay ka na. Kaawaan ka nawa ng Diyos pero bahala ka na diyan.

Pagod na akong umintindi sa friend kong religious na nasa toxic relationship,"My friend, in her 40's, has married a guy 20years her junior. 

Before they are married, they were happy nong una. Guy was sweet and I think what got her heart is the guy is really proud of her and their relationship despite their huge age gap.

Years down the line lumabas ang tunay na kulay ng guy. He's a cheater and a liar. He can't stop contacting his exes. Heck, tinago niya na may anak pala siya sa ex niya. Also, ginawa niyang sugar mommy ang friend ko. Pag hindi napagbigyan ang luho or di nabigyan ng pera, he will be verbally abusive towards my friend. 

Pero si friend, oh my god. She will try and justify all his actions with bible verses kahit nasasaktan na siya. Kesyo 'asawa' na daw niya di daw niya kayang hiwalayan. Ipapasa-diyos na lang niya at magdadasal siya araw araw para magbago siya.

Then nagpropose si guy. I completely oppose to this. Again, di nakinig si friend kasi hopeful siya na through marriage, magbago na si guy dahil their relationship is 'blessed' by God na.

Unsurprisingly, hindi nagbago si guy. In fact, he got *worst*. Mas lalo siya naging verbally abusive cos my friend does not have financial means anymore to sustain the lifestyle he wants. It has now escalated to physical violence. 

My heart is breaking for my friend cos she's such a sweet, beautiful person and she does not deserve this. Kaya din siya nagstay with the guy cos he grew up in a broken family and my friend just wants him to feel the love he never felt from his family.

My friend left his abuse for a few months. I fully supported her and binibigyan ko ng advise and make her realise her worth. Akala ko natauhan na siya but boy I was wrong. 

Bumalik si guy and he 'changed'. My friend thought na 'answered prayers' yung pagbabago niya. Nagbunga ang araw araw na pagdadasal niya. Sweet na sila ulit and mukhang masaya na sila ulit. 

This morning she is messaging me again on how guy is going back to verbally abusing her and it has escalated again. She asked for some money na pamasahe to leave him. I am happy to do so pero how long will this cycle go?

Sa totoo lang pagod na pagod na ako sa linyahan niya na ipapasa-diyos nalang niya lahat na magdadasal siya lagi para magkaayos sila. 

I hope she will leave him for good.

We are so fed up of our dad,"He never fails to ruin Christmas and New Year eversince we were a child. Even the simplest celebration, he always makes a way to ruin the joy of it by drinking too much then verbally and physically abusing my mom. This already gave us a deep trauma. He doesn’t even care. Even his grandchildren are already having a trauma.

He still doesn’t realize why the hell we didn’t want to celebrate any occasion at home anymore. We are so fed up. Me and my siblings told mom to leave him alone this coming new year. Or just leave him there alone forever. We are willing to find a separate place for mom and the kids (my OFW sibling’s kids).

He is a narcissist. He blames everyone about any bad thing except himself. He will always choose other people over his family. He will side with the people who did bad things to his family. He is an extreme people pleaser. He is hypocrate. He is very pretentious. He is toxic. There is no peace everytime he is around.

We already did what we can to adjust for him. Tried to talk to him when he is not drunk, but too egoistic to talk about the issue. When he’s drunk he will open it up but you will never ever understand him (because he’s f*cking drunk).

We are so fed up. He is a hopeless case.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/18ska22/we_are_so_fed_up_of_our_dad/,t2_40hyu5etu,2023-12-28 11:50:45,3,0

I'm still healing,"I didn't realize how bad it was until it was over. You don't think it will ever happen to you until it does. He was verbally abusive, would scream at the top of his lungs, gas lite the fuck outta me, and tried to become physically abusive. 

I left the day he threw me from the door to the couch after I broke up with him asking for another chance I only made it out because I had it ready to call the police and showed him I would call if he didn't move from by the door and let me leave.

He followed me to the car stood in front of it and hit it once before I hit call and put it on speaker he ran back to his place. I left so the police never came. 

This guy was going into the military so I told him while he was in basic. I was going to move to Utah for college and go to school. He ended up getting into an accident and getting a dui so he could not go anymore. He expected me to cancel my plans and stay and when I told him no, he accused me of leaving the state so I could leave him.

Now almost a decade later happily married with a baby and I realized how much he messed me up.
I would constantly check in with my husband to make sure I wasn't doing anything wrong as soon as I felt like I disappointed him I would cower waiting for the yelling and name calling slut shaming.

My ex apologized to me years later and was mad that his apology didn't garner the response he expected. I have you blocked how are you even contacting me sir!!!!

I still find myself sometimes falling back into those behaviors and then I'm reminded that's no longer me so I don't need to wear those wounds anymore

I'm so sick of my dad who emotionally tortures me,"Idk why, but for some reason my dad is angry at me all the time. Hindi siya yung galit na may verbal or physical abuse. Yung galit niya involves his general interaction towards me. I can sense his anger just by his facial expressions also. Mahilig din siya magdabog when I'm around. He also barely talks to me. Kakausapin niya lang ako if may kailangan siyang sabihin or itanong na importante. Actually, he avoids me as much as he can. Like for example, hindi siya papasok sa kitchen if nasa loob ako, talagang hihintayin niya akong lumabas bago siya pumasok. He's also emotionally unavailable, so I was never close to him growing up. 

Matagal na siyang ganito sa akin, bata pa lang ako ganyan na siya, I'm already 22 btw. For a while I was so angry with him, lalo na nung high school period ko. But actually natanggap ko na na ganyan na siya forever, so I made peace with his actions na, or so I thought.  Recently kasi, I felt that pain and hurt again when he would do those things to me. I'm so sick of it. 

I wish he wasn't my father. Actually nasabihan ko na siya when I was a kid na sana hindi nalang siya yung dad ko. I honestly forgot why I said that, and I honestly don't even remember saying that to him. Sinabi lang sakin ng mom ko yun, and I still mean it to this day. But I won't let him make me suffer forever. I will remove his power to hurt me, and one day it won't hurt anymore.

I want to break up with my partner of 7 years,"We’ve been through college together and are almost done with grad school. Been through almost every struggle together, in school or personal.  I preface this by saying my partner comes from an abusive household. Some verbal abuse (and sometimes physical, usually throwing things) has happened at their home, and I’ve even been an audience to some at times. My partner has also been verbally abusive to me during fights during the past years, which he has honestly been improving  and changing significantly on.

&#x200B;

A few months prior, we had a huge fight that resulted in me calling it quits. Things got quite ugly. It started as screaming in my face, begging, crying. Then when I rejected all of it, things got physical — not at me though. They started harming themselves in front of me which didn’t amount to much (just a few scratches, thank god). I've put the trigger warning so I won't go into detail, but it involves a certain kitchen tool and household cleaning product.

&#x200B;

I’ve honestly been fucked up ever since. I didn’t confide in family until last week (I’ve lived apart from them since 2015), and only one of my friends knows about all that happened but they live very far away. I can’t hear a knock on my door without fearing they will burst through or start screaming at me. This is the first time they’ve ever done anything remotely physical, but I’m scared it wont be the last. I’ve since moved to a new location  and never told them about it (they don’t know where I live now, but it’s still really close to where I was prior so they could easily find out if they asked around). I want to break up with them, I just don’t know how to do it without potentially being  physically hurt.

&#x200B;

Thing is, they appear to be a model partner in public spaces. Everyone knows them as the funny and smart guy. They always post us when we go out to have dinner, and looking from the outside they really look like the model partner. They have connections that can get me to a great career path too. But I want to break it off now, regardless. None of my graduate school friends know about the incident, because news spreads quickly and I don’t want to ruin his future. But it’s really jarring to think how crazy he can get behind closed doors like that. I don’t know how to end things without it getting ugly.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/146qxo1/i_want_to_break_up_with_my_partner_of_7_years/,t2_hi7gew77,2023-06-11 18:53:55,5,0
Stop procreating!!!,"I've been hating my life for the longest and suicidal. 

Here's why, 
Mom and dad is not emotionally matured enough to raise a loving family. 
My dad ended up cheating leaving my mom in misery, Became an OFW to support us. 
Our oldest brother end up being a criminal, My Oldest sister became the head of the family since dad no longer with us and mom is abroad. (She was just in 3rd year college btw) 
My other brother who is 5years older than me plays the victim role and the bully alternately. 
I am the punching bag. 

- I grew up having a conflicted personality coz I always need to be conscious with the way I behave, They are easily irritated and gets angry. My childhood years was like walking on eggshells, constant fear and anxiety. 

- I thought that my emotion never matter since I am always invalidated growing up. 

- We were poor and my sister needs to sacrifice her studies for us. 

- My sister lived in with her partner, I end up living with my brother which was hell. I always cry at night, He screams at me all the time and verbally abused me, Physical abuse was also present. I thought all families are like this. 

- Present- I am now 29, living faw away,  No plans to get married or have kids,  Why? I still have all the traumas in me. I still hear voices in my head. I have issues socializing, I still cry, I dunno bounderies, I am so hard on myself everytime I fail on something. I even caught myself repeating the behavior of my brother to my colleagues. I feel so mentally fucked up in life. 

I am writing this to whoever may read this to please THINK a million times before you procreate. 
Ask yourself if you can give your child a complete loving and supportive family, Financial support and emotional support. 

You might not see the bigger effects of this neglects yet, but try to dig deep why there are psychopaths, sociopaths or increased with  depression cases,  uproductive prople of the society etc. 

I am speaking from a perspective of a neglected child who constantly fights depression, traumas and urge of wanting to k*ll someone/myself. I never wanted to be born anyways. What choice do I have coming to this world. 

 Educate yourself and stop procreating if you're not ready.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/18oei18/stop_procreating/,t2_oou8dbe7,2023-12-22 21:06:14,1,0
I got diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder today,"I've been dealing with PTSD for a long time due to childhood trauma and physical abuse, but I know that I've made so much progress since I've been diagnosed in 2018. Late last year, I moved to a stressful job for a higher salary because I am paying for my brother's tuition and I'm preparing for his college education.

Starting January this year, I started noticing that my episodes and breakdowns have gotten more frequent, even with medications. I also experienced new symptoms, like sudden highs that I can't explain/control (which usually precedes a breakdown), severe forgetfulness (like nagugulat ako sa hawak ko kasi nakalimutan ko na may hawak ako), and insomnia.

Today, i got diagnosed with bipolar disorder. My meds will be changed up gradually from boosting my mood (antidepressants) to stabilizing my mood. 

I am extremely overwhelmed. Just when I thought I had a chance of living a semi-normal life since I've learned to manage my PTSD, I got this diagnosis. Mas mahal pa yung meds. And I've lost friends to bipolar disorder before.

Hindi ko maimagine yet how to go forward from here. Do i tell my friends? My family? My boss? I don't even know how to tell my boyfriend because I know it has been difficult for him too to have a partner with mental health issues.

Should I tell my boss? I'm trying to do well at my job as a manager, but I'm scared of being judged, that i am a risk to the team. I don't have the confidence to say that I can prove otherwise with my performance. On the other hand, what if it gets bad and I really need someone to cover for me while I'm out/not functional? I also don't want to give the impression that I am asking for concessions. TL;DR, I just want to be perceived as a normal (preferably high performing) employee, but I also think it's necessary to have a failsafe.

I guess that's my dilemma in general -- i want to have a semblance of a normal life / I don't want people to tiptoe around me, but at the same time, i acknowledge that I need help. 

Oh i dread purchasing the first batch of meds.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1b9ning/i_got_diagnosed_with_bipolar_disorder_today/,t2_vk4bswpl,2024-03-08 21:08:11,2,0
A relative committed suicide,"I'll start this off by saying that me and that relative were not really close as of recently, but when we were younger, we were neighbors and would often play outside.

A younger relative, who was 15 last year, took his own life. His immediate family is saying that he did it because his gf broke up with him, though honestly, most of us think that it's a cover-up since he had shitty parents. I can't really say much since we're not that close anymore. The person who was first to discover him hanging was his younger sister; they were able to rush him to the hospital, but he was declared brain dead, and after three days, he was gone. 

The younger sister is traumatized by that sight and we would often see her posts on socmed that she wants to off her self too. Some of my cousins who see the said posts are badmouthing her, saying that the younger generation is so sensitive and goes on romanticizing the physical abuse they had growing up. I'm doing my best to cheer up the kid by recommending ways to cope with this, but the supposed ""grownups"" are not even batting an eye. It makes me disgusted.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/zpgvrh/a_relative_committed_suicide/,t2_flpshucf,2022-12-19 11:38:35,25,3
I want to run away but I'm scared.,"TW: physical, and emotional abuse mention

(Sorry for the wrong Filipino terms English is my first language even if I'm half-Filo)

Hi, 18 na ako since last year pa - turning 19 this year. Trans male ako, I knew since I was a teen pa. I live in a upperclassmen home, no rent just bills but I want to run away and go somewhere far far from my family.

 I have been abused since I was a kid, my dad had a bad temper cause of his own dad. He would hit us when we did something wrong, or yell at us if we didn't do it quick enough or right in his eyes. He has lessened the physical violence since we're older now, but won't hesitate to shout and cuss us out if we don't meet his standards.

I live with my mom, brother (24M), sister (19F), and dad's side in the house. Hindi ako pwede umalis without permission, kasi girl ako. My sister is treated much worse, as a black sheep for some reason hindi ko alam why. She is a good student, very loud but very bubbly to everyone, really nice. Yet my mom doesn't like her, says she's being influenced by her friends? but I know her friends, they're fine - just loud lang.

Just recently lang, my sister got too loud and was yelled at - told off for being a disturbance, kasi she got too heated in a game. My mom pulled her aside, and I won't go into detail, but she is in danger of getting kicked out.

I don't want her to leave, I don't know what I'd do without her kasi, but she's at risk of getting hurt before kicked out daw. I want her to be safe, but I don't want her to stay here too. Our home is very unstable but it's a good home outside of the family issues.

I only have debit and gcash but it's not enough if she leaves, I want to go with her if that happens, I don't want her to be alone. I want to get a job but not even allowed part time bc of college. Everything I own belongs to my family, aside from a few things that aren't important.

I want to keep her safe bc she raised me, but I don't want to get hurt and kicked out too. I want to support her in every way possible.  I'm not skilled in anything but drawing.

Sorry po if this is disorganized, I'm very worried for my sister and I needed to rant.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1b5elln/i_want_to_run_away_but_im_scared/,t2_ocddjwbam,2024-03-03 18:59:56,1,0
Grieving because I miss my grandma during her pre-dementia years,"
My grandmother looked after me from my early years until my teenage phase. This was due to my mother being overseas to avoid her parental duties, while my father had another family because my mom was his mistress.

My grandmother's approach to parenting was authoritative, which caused me to hate her while growing up. She used emotional and physical abuse as a means of discipline. In my opinion, these are disciplinary methods of the silent generation.

During my teenage years, I often returned home late just to avoid her presence. I avoid  discussing my school experiences with her and would immediately go inside my room.

 I regret my decision of hating her during my teenage years. My perspective shifted drastically when the person who had cared for me ended up in the hospital.

Despite her strictness, she taught me values and beliefs that have shaped my character, something only a family member can do. I now recognize that I was not alone in life.

Regrettably, after multiple hospitalizations, her health deteriorated, and our family doctor diagnosed her with dementia. 

While she's still alive, her communication skills lack the receptiveness and expressiveness they had before her dementia.

Taking pictures together now requires me to prompt her to smile, which is heartbreaking. Her ability to carry out daily activities independently has diminished due to dementia, intensifying the grief I feel...

I deeply regret underestimating her significance in my life yet I'm now committed to providing her with the love and care she deserves in her remaining years. 

However, I doubt I can fully repay her kindness of molding me to become the person I am today.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/15yybmj/grieving_because_i_miss_my_grandma_during_her/,t2_7x9u2t51,2023-08-23 17:06:55,3,0
My boyfriend made me cry.,"I just want to get this off my chest.

Crying has always been a painful thing for me. When I cry, there's a genuine pain deep in my stomach and it makes me cry out both from the sheer mental pain and from the physical pain. It's like the deep hurt I have bottled up takes physical form.

But today, I didn't cry because I was in pain... There was no pain... **Just happiness!** My boyfriend made me cry happy tears for the first time in my life.

Kakatapos lang namin mag-dinner at pinagluto ko siya kahit I sucked at it. I tried, I really did.  I was already working when this happened. Busy ako sa pagpapakaalipin ng salapi.

He spoke in a neutral tone and said, *""Love, alam mo ba?""*

*""Hindi pa""*, I replied.

*""You're the best partner.""*

*""Thank you.""*

Patlang.

*""I want to have a future with you.""*

I didn't know how to respond. I looked at him and gave him a sly smile. Sabi ko what's up? Was it the tuna sandwich I made earlier? Tapos bumalik lang ako sa pagtatrabaho. I looked at him again. Nakatitig lang siya sa akin. Sabi ko what's up ulit? Wala raw. I continued working tapos paglingon ko, he's still staring. Nilapitan ko na siya and I hugged him. I jokingly said na taga-probinsiya ako pero hindi ako marunong manggayuma. We laughed tapos naging seryoso siya ulit. He started saying such kind things like:*""You're beautiful, you're smart, you're kind and caring. You're compassionate. Sobrang alaga mo. I couldn't ask for more. I appreciate you. I want to have a future with you.""* I hugged him and I wept softy.

I've never been told anything like this before...  Zero, nada! My whole life, I've been used to abuse and hurt. Ni kahit thank you sa mga tao, wala. To hear such simple yet kind sentences as these... shook me to my core. Words like that were so alien to me. I cried on his chest for a good hour. He just held me. I think a part of me healed tonight. This guy made me believe again in a concept often dismissed as hackneyed -- LOVE.

Deal breaker sa akin ang kasal at pagaanak but there's nobody else I'd rather spend the rest of my life with... I want to have a future with my boyfriend too...",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/171k0a3/my_boyfriend_made_me_cry/,t2_qgtnxp4f,2023-10-07 02:32:54,100,10
emotional roulette,"the usual. wala namang bago, but i can feel it taking a toll on me na talaga both mentally and physically. walking on eggshells sa araw-araw, sasabayan mo pa ng pakiramdaman sa mga tao sa paligid mo na para bang roleta ang emosyon. do i get the calm attitude? do i get the aggressive one? (always the later haha) sobrang nakakapagod manghula, mag-abang, at maging cautious all the time. do i only get verbal abuse, or do i get the side of physical threats this time as well? buti na nga lang its been months since the last physical thing that i've experienced and all that i have to worry about at this moment are the verbal things.

hindi na natalab sakin 'yung hayaan na lang pumasok sa isang tenga, labas sa kabila. namumuro na ko to the extent na lagi na kong na-ttritrigger and be on the verge of relapse every time i hear someone raise their voice, or just even talk. sobrang rattled ko na lately, my neck and head hurts, and hindi na napapawi yung antok sa katawan ko.

Here in the US bứt terribly depressed.,"As the title says I’m here moved here in the US not too long ago, leaving all my friends and adoptive family behind to look for a job so that I can sustain myself and my future family. I know I cannot complain, I’d be ungrateful if I did, but right now there’s just this huge empty feeling in my chest. I cannot stop crying whenever I miss the Philippines. 

America has its own culture, one where I cannot or I don’t want to understand. Especially living in a red state where guns are legal and education is considered insignificant. Sometimes just walking down the street or driving makes me fear for my life.  Life here feels like a competition, you always have to one up the other otherwise you’ll get looked down upon. They’re just so angry sometimes. 

Even staying with my family is making me so sad. My parents are here, luckily they don’t stay in the same house as I do, but every time I see them, my trauma resurfaces. We don’t have that familial connection. They have sacrificed their family for work, work, work, and work. That we never had a relationship. Both verbally abusive parents (though separated, thank God, well dad is both verbally and physically abusive) still breathe down my neck, not letting me pursue the career that I want. They act like they own me even I after I already finished my degree. 

 I feel like there is no purpose for my life. I will be stuck at a career I never chose for myself. I don’t talk to anybody about this because it sounds so ungrateful. I have little to no money, nõ emotional support, no one to rely to, no one to ask for guidance, no beaches here, no scenery, nothing to ease my anxiety or depression. I’m so homesick.  Sometimes I really don’t see a way out of it. I want to live my life, I don’t want to sacrifice all my time to work like they expected me to. Maybe I just want to be okay.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/16e396r/here_in_the_us_bứt_terribly_depressed/,t2_76niz8p4d,2023-09-09 19:21:40,0,2
as a tired friend na akisma,"pagod na me maging available sa friend kong tumatawag or mag chachat lang pag nag away ng jowa nyang abuser. she has a history of depression and she said parang it's coming back dahil dito sa jowa nya na di nya kaya hiwalayan kahit ginagawa na syang punching bag physically and emotionally. she'll call when im working kahit tambak na ako ng workload kakausapin ko muna sya ending mapapa OT ako pag ok na sya she will not reply to my messages asking if how's she doing na. 

this morning while im asleep, nag chat sya and pet peeve ko talaga ang mga nag chachat ng walang context or tatawagin ka muna sa chat.  pagod na pagod ako sa work this week dahil 3 nag resign sa amin so bigat ng workload isang week 2-4 hrs OT. so tulog pa ako mga teh nagising ako ng freaking 5AM dahil sa tawag nya pag sagot ko umiiyak na naman ang gaga. this time, nag sorry ako dahil gusto kong magpahinga dahil ako pagod na pagod na rin ako sa life and wala naman akong mapagsasabihan so di ko na kaya pa mag accommodate pa ng problema ng iba.

most of my friends are like that. ako pa mag aaya sa mga tropa ko pag may isa kaming friend na sad but pag ako nag aaya sa kanila na di ko sasabihin na ""kasi malungkot si ganito"" no one's available. very relate ako sa certain lyrics talaga nung song na Maps na ""I was there for you in your darkest times
I was there for you in your darkest night. But I wonder, where were you? When I was at my worst down on my knees. And you said you had my back. So I wonder, where were you?""

edited: i'm not the type of friend na masalita or know how to comfort through words dahil di ako ung sweet type of friend. what i do is sasamahan ko lang friends ko kumbaga i express it through action not words. maybe, ako takbuhan nila because i'm a funny girl na madaldal pag magkakasama kami kahit anong group of friends pa yan i am the funny one. the joker of the group. but when it comes sa pag hingi ng advise or comforting words, di ko kaya yun.

broke up because it’s Ramadan,"I still can’t believe I was almost manipulated and gaslighted into marriage by a Muslim who can’t even bring food to the table para lang mafeed ko ego niya kasi malapit na Ramadan.

Don’t get me wrong, may kaya naman sila pero he chose to do haram relationship with me and live with me (gulat na lang ako lumayas na siya sa kanila) kaya nawala access niya sa pera from his Family. We’ve been together for more than a year and yung last year Ramadan ewan parang kasalanan ko pa na hindi siya nakapag Ramadan last year eh di ko naman siya pinilit na lumayas sa kanila it was all his decision

Before we broke up, pinipressure niya ako ikasal last month para daw umabot sa ramadan tapos okay lang daw kahit wag na sabihin sa family ko (which is a big NO for me). Nagworry ako sa gastos kasi kahit di naman bongga gusto ko maayos dream wedding ko sabi di naman daw need 500 pesos lang daw yun HAHAHAHA. Tapos yung singsing nagtitingin siya sa Lazada ng tig 200 💀💀 

I love him tho pero abusive physically and mentally. Sama mo na financially haha. Napa oo niya ako in one point but ended kicking him out of my house since di niya nga kaya sarili niya idadamay niya pa ako. Di ako materialistic na tao but from what I’ve learned is that in Islam, men are the provider for basic needs, kind and compassionate, a spiritual partner and should respect my autonomy. Kaso hindi siya yun.  

Kung nandito ka man at mababasa mo to. Sana di ka na temporary muslim boy na matino lang pag ramadan tapos back to normal na ulit 😂 at least may tolerance break ka 🍃🍃😂  

Ps. I loved him and willing ako magconvert kasi gusto ko din maging Muslim. I fell inlove with the beliefs and culture. Kaso si guy … nahhh a real Muslim will bring me peace not death to his woman.
