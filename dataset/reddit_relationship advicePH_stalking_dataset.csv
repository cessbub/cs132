I (21F) keep stalking my ex (22M) and his new girl's socmed accounts even though it is bad for my mental health.,"For context: Me and my ex were broken up for only a month nung nihard launch na niya ung girl sa ig niya. The girl also posted my ex on her story. Funny lang kasi supposed to be 23rd monthsary a sana namin yung day na yon (when they posted the story)

Nagusap kami 2 weeks after break up and sabi niya ayaw na niya magjowa, wala na raw siyang gana lmao 

I know that break na kami and wala na dapat ako pake since wala na ko control sa life niya pero I feel disrespected since they're like rubbing it in my face.
I keep stalking them parang nasa daily routine ko na yon üò≠ and I wanna stop na for my peace of mind and I wanna protect my heart. Any tips how to deal with this?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/14gqkcn/i_21f_keep_stalking_my_ex_22m_and_his_new_girls/,t2_vwoza4il,2023-06-23 14:08:04,20,39
Found something while online stalking my boyfriend's ex's social media and don't know what to do about it,"TW // mentions of sexual assault, minor mentions of suicide

This was already posted in r/Advice, just need as much advice as I can get. 

I've been incredibly torn on what to do about this for a few weeks now and really need some sort of advice. 

I (21F) have been with my boyfriend (22M) for around a year. I am incredibly nosey and, though I have no fears in my relationship, occasionally stalk my boyfriend's ex's (22F) social media accounts. Recently, I found my way onto her Facebook page. I scrolled a bit and found a post from a few months ago that has me incredibly freaked out. It was a post from some months back saying that on that day one year ago, my now boyfriend had sexually assaulted her. They had broken up just a few months before but were still living together at the time. No details were given on what happened so that's basically all I know about the alleged assault.

I have always thought of myself as someone who would immediately end a relationship if my partner were accused of something like this, but I have what I think is fair reason to be suspicious of these claims. 

After a few months of bf and I being together, ex messaged and told him she wants to get back together. Throughout their relationship, she was incredibly mentally abusive and controlling, causing him to have no life outside of their relationship because she wouldn't let him. He declined to get back together and she lost her mind. This lead to months of stalking and harassment from her. For the next few months, her attempts to get him to take her back include:

‚Ä¢ Showing up to his house multiple times unannounced until he had to threaten calling the police so she would leave. 

‚Ä¢ Messaging his friends and family to ask them to try and convince him to take her back. 

‚Ä¢ Multiple threats on her own life, including holding a knife to her throat when she found out he was so much as in the talking stage with me.

‚Ä¢ Spam calling him and spam messaging him on every platform constantly, even when she got no response.

‚Ä¢ After he finally blocked her, showing up at his job to confront him.

All of these incidents happened many months after the alleged assault. He had finally blocked her 3 months before she made the post about the assault. Taking all of this into account, I don't think it's crazy to wonder if the post was some way to get back at him for not taking her back. I don't want to jump to any conclusions, I think I'm just terrified of what he'll say when I talk to him about it. The absolute best case scenario is that he didn't do it, but if that is true, that means there is still a post out there accusing him of something so horrific. There is no good outcome in the conversation, as the worst case scenario just means he DID assault her. 

I'm not worried about how he'll feel about me finding the post (I am incredibly open with him and he knows that I stalk her accounts on occasion), I just am scared for what the outcome will be. It's so easy to say this, but I cannot imagine him assaulting someone. He has never been anywhere near pushy when it comes to sex, and I cannot fathom the possibility that he might've assaulted someone. 

Everything I detailed about the he endured throughout their relationship or the time she was stalking him I was either there for or have been shown proof of, so I have no reason to doubt that. 

I just don't know where to go from here. He's noticed me being very upset and panicked recently but I've told him I can't talk about it yet. I promised that I will bring it up though, because regardless of the truth, it isn't fair for me to not share what I know. The part of me that has been assaulted myself is mad at me for doubting her story, but the part of me that was there for her stalking/harassment and knows him well is still so skeptical of everything.

I just need some honest advice on if my logic makes sense and how to confront him with this, please. Thank you for reading. 


This is my first Reddit post and I don't know how it works yet, I am just hoping this post doesn't get too much attention so that I can make sure it isn't found by any involved parties. Just need advice from a few people please.

"my boyfriend [M 23] don't want my [F 22] nudes anymore but keeps stalking and liking sexy pics on ig, this has been going on for months and i just feel neglected","First time ko here sa reddit, not even sure kung tama yung pagpost ko (my untechy a**), genuine question tho, ako na ba si OA nyan?... mind you, we are already 4yrs in a relationship, this is not even my thing but he made me feel crazy got me posting in reddit seeking for advice.

I can still recall how much he is into me before, to the point na naiiyak ako sa overwhelming love nya, i felt secured and special, but now i kinda sense he currently at the 'slowly hating your gf phase' is he unattracted to me na? inaaddress ko paulit-ulit sakanya na uncomfy ako sa mini-interactions w/ sexy random girlies (instagram likes) plus as a partner (di ako forced mag send) i feel the need to compensate our intimacy needs by doing so (LDR kami), also i made sure the intervals of me asking are not frequent and aligned on his free time, before naman appreciated ako at gustong gusto nya rin ang nudes ko, he used to initiate frequently, pero lately... is it because we are long term na? na di na sya interested? i am trying to make-up for the ""physical touch"" unfulfilled love language nya and i really understand how he is not good with communication (considering na words of affirmation ang love language ko)... istg i only act crazy with the silent treatment, pero nad-drain na ako kaka overthink at kakaexplain na i've got needs too, all i wanted is assurance and i know for sure you need extra effort kapag LDR, I even worked on learning the game he plays (another thing that triggers me to learn is yung shini-ship sya sa girlgamer on their circle (online gamer friends), i know what matters is his response, but i'm insecure enough to say their interaction is threatening) so i can understand his stories, and even get addicted (neglect studies) improving my gameplay so he can play with me. I WAS BUSY FINDING ACCESIBLE ACTIVITIES (online games etc.) TO COMPENSATE FOR THE DISTANCE So yeah, kinda desperate for appreciation aren't I? also whenever i address something he would reply as if nothing happened lang, dinidisregard concern ko then pag pinoint out ang behavior mapperceive nya na gusto ko ng away, i just feel misunderstood. Is it normal on long term relationships for communication and intimacy to hit rock bottom or am i just over reacting lang ba?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/185zgvm/my_boyfriend_m_23_dont_want_my_f_22_nudes_anymore/,t2_naoyfi9n0,2023-11-29 00:03:24,22,17

he was the one who broke up with me at nantaboy. his mind was so clouded that he didn‚Äôt listen to my explanations after he accused me of cheating when my friends and i have all the proofs that i didn‚Äôt. i begged him to stay in the relationship. nung sobrang gulo na talaga, i had to go to their house which took 4 hours and 4 rides just to beg him to stay. i called him numerous times to stay. pero all he was saying was ‚Äúayoko na‚Äù ‚Äútapos na tayo‚Äù ‚Äúnaooff na ako sayo‚Äù. sobrang dali sakanya para sabihin mga yon sakin while i was sobbing so much, telling him how much i love him. tapos eto siya ngayon, laging nagpaparamdam sa tiktok ko, namumuhay lang naman ako ng tahimik.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/12jhdcl/my_ex_22m_stalks_me_almost_everyday_ever_since/,t2_ontk5854,2023-04-12 18:14:10,6,7
My [F20] bf [M21] of 1 year and eight months still stalks his ex's FB account. How should I take this?,"My bf \[M21\] and I \[F20\] have been together for one year and eight months and friends for four years before becoming official‚Äîkilala talaga namin isa't isa as we are so close and always there for each other. We both had jowa before we ended up together, both firsts, both didn't last long. Pero we are not rebounds of each other since we tried dating others again after the first relationship.

Beginning of the relationship, I made it clear na I don't like him reacting or commenting sa posts ng mga past flings and ex niya. At first di niya kaya itigil pero unti-unti naman nawala din. Pero after months, nakita ko nagrereact na siya ulit sa ex niya, yung mga nirreactan pa ay may connect sa pagiging single ni girl. Syempre inopen ko 'to sa kanya and he was sorry about it again. 

Pero today I saw he stalked his ex again. He is currently nasa outing with fam and friends. I logged in his account and saw he visited ex's profile last night. Probably because nag-heart react si ex sa story niyang nasa beach. 

How should I take this? Dapat ba hayaan ko na lang? Ipa-block ko si ex? Maybe this is actually fine and oa lang ako?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/133dqyh/my_f20_bf_m21_of_1_year_and_eight_months_still/,t2_9al2fruw0,2023-04-30 10:37:01,4,8
Am I (F21) overthinking that my bf (M22) likes someone else that he recently followed on instagram?,"My bf of 2 years went out with his friends para sa birthday last last week, it really didn't bother me then since I know his friends and most of them have gfs naman. Yung fren ng bf ko na may birthday may isang sinama na girl na tropa daw non. Wala pa ko pake masyado non.

Then days after, I posted some stories and since my account is public nakikita ng iba profile ko. I checked the views and may nakita ako which surprised me na yung nagview is yung girl na nakasama ng boyfriend ko sa birthday. May nagfollow din sakin na lalaki (I stalked him, friend din nung girl na yon) Then may nagview pa then I stalked her, bestfriend din nung girl. Both didn't attend the party. Yung girl lang na isa.

That bothered me pero di ko na inisip masyado, wala naman ako sa party pero bat alam socials ko bigla? Weird. Then kanina nagffollowan na sila ng boyfriend ko. I asked him sino yun sabi niya, ""yan yung tropa ni *his friend* nuon"". Eh yung ibang friends naman ng jowa ko na may girlfriend di naman finollow nung girl. Siya lang? Then di na ko nireplyan ng bf ko after I said na niview nung girl na yon mga story ko. I feel disrespected sksk

Maybe because tinanggal ako sa highlights niya. If you browse my bf's account parang single lang siya. Lol.

Note: Siya yung nagagalit before na bawal daw magfollow ng ibang lalaki, I even removed some of my guy friends sa ig. I compromised kasi ayaw niya non then siya naman gumagawa ng ayaw niya ü´†",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/12sel8w/am_i_f21_overthinking_that_my_bf_m22_likes/,t2_vwoza4il,2023-04-20 07:39:38,28,34
"I (F23) found out that my fubu (M27) has a girlfriend. Naging kabit na pala ako, di ko man lang alam.","LONG POST AHEAD
I met this guy on a dating app.  
He's 4 yrs older than me so he was thinking of settling down na daw. Kaso we're not on the same page, kasi I still want to explore after leaving my 5 year relationship. But we still continued talking despite that hanggang sa nagkita na kami since magkalapit lang naman lugar namin. Also, according to him, last relationship nya is 2 yrs ago pa. 

Long story short, we've been fubu for more than a month now. He wants us to be exclusive, because I told him I also had a fubu before him, which is fine with me for safety rin naman kasi. May times na nagsasabi sya ng 'ily' sakin which I think wala namang meaning pero sometimes he would ask me if wala pa rin daw ba akong feelings for him, which I would answer na wala (kasi I see him as a walking red flag & I'm just there for sx) and ayaw ko pa rin magkaron ng relationship pero sya gusto nya. I also know that he's been talking with other girls pero 'kalandian' nya lang daw yun na taga malayo which is okay with me if yun lang naman kasi I'm talking to other guys din.

Then one time, while we're together, he asked me, ""Pano kung bigla akong mag-asawa?"". I was confused, so I asked if meron na ba syang aasawahin. Sabi nya wala naman daw so sabi ko, ""Ikaw bahala"". Tinawanan nya lang and parang nang-aasar, tapos sabi nya, ""Di kita iiwan kahit may asawa't anak na ako. Kabit kita ganun."" Parang nagpintig yung tenga ko dun so sabi ko, ""Di ko pinangarap maging kabit."" Then ayun after that day may onting usap pa then biglang one week syang walang paramdam. Chinat ko pa sya sa ml after 2 days na walang chats kasi magkalaro rin kami dun, asking in a pabiro na way kung nag-asawa na nga ba sya. Naglalaro sya pero di ako nirereplyan. A week after no contact nagdeact ako ng fb tas akala nya binlock ko sya kaya napachat sya sakin sa ml, di naman daw sya nag-asawa & wala rin daw syang jowa. Tas after nun sabi nya miss nya na raw ako & he wants to meet me again, but I'm loosing interest na so di ko masyado inentertain.

I don't know what happened to me that day. Matagal na rin kasi akong kinukutuban nun so I decided to stalk his account which I wish I did before talking to him. Wala pang 3 mins, I found a girl's account na one of his fb friends na cover photo yung pic nilang dalawa and nung March 9 lang pinost. Tapos meron din silang pic nung Dec. 2023 pa and may comment pa si guy na ""I love you"" dun sa pic. Ibig sabihin in a relationship sila di ba??? Then last kita namin, nung March 13 lang. Di ko kinaya. Grabe lang the audacity of this guy, gustong exlusive pero sya naman pala may iba. Di ko man lang alam, naging other woman na pala ako. :(((

Naawa ako sa babae so I tried to chat her using a dump account. Asking what's her relationship with the guy to confirm. Kaso di pa nagreply, binlock na yung account. I don't know why, maybe nagaslight na sya nung guy or hawak yung account ni ate girl at yung guy unang nakakita. 

Until now, chinachat pa rin ako ni guy kasi nagmaang-maangan lang ako para di nya alam na ako mag-expose kay girl. Tho sobrang dalang na ng chat nya kasi di na ako pumapayag makipagkita. Should I just ghost him or sasabihan ko pa si guy sa nalaman ko? Gusto ko rin kasi masabihan pa si ate girl kasi kawawa naman sya if di nya alam kalokohan ng jowa nya but di ko na alam paano kasi blocked na. 

Update: I stalked the girl ulit. Locked na fb profile nya and nagchange na rin sya ng cover photo, family nya na ata. I'm not sure if nagbreak na sila (hopefully). I didn't talk to the guy, and he didn't chat me anymore.

"My(24F) boyfriend(31M) got a comment from his ex on instagram, I considered it disrespectful towards me for her to comment and asked him to delete the comment and block her. ‚ÄúInvestigating‚Äù further found out that they had small talks in the DM‚Äôs","
**TL;DR - My boyfriend got a comment from his ex on a post and he engaged with her on dm‚Äôs for the first 4 months into our relationship. This made me uncomfortable and talked with my boyfriend and he deleted the comment, after that they stopped talking and she blocked me on instagram(she was the one stalking initially). I saw that they had small conversations but it‚Äôs bothering me because she is an attention seeker 
**
Me(24F) and my boyfriend(31M) are together for an year now, the problem is that he still follows his ex(from 4y ago, a 4-5y long relationship, extremely toxic on her end as my bf describes it), which it's not that big of a deal, but when we started posting stories together I noticed she was keep watching my ig profile. Naturally I went to my stalking account to look at her profile and I saw that my bf is still liking her posts, then I went to his profile and I noticed that she left a comment on one of his pictures(picture made by me in one of our vacation). I told him that the comment bothers me and he should block her and delete the comment because she is being disrespectful towards me commenting on his post, and he doesn't really have a reason to still follow her. He didn't want to do any of the things initially, but in the end he agreed to delete the comment, because she was a very toxic person and doesn't want this bad energies in his life anymore. Recently I looked in his phone(I never did this before because I trusted him) because I had a really strong gut feeling and couldn't stop thinking about this whole situation that happened 3 months ago. I went to their conversation and I noticed that she was keep texting him (last message was from 4 months ago) about random things (example: she texted him that he has a ""debt"" cause he didn't liked her last post, and he actually went and liked it afterwards and other small conversations like this that were kind of regular until that comment was deleted). He replied to all this kind of messages but didn't really entertained the conversations too much. I'm not concerned that he is cheating on me with her because she is in another country, but I feel really bad that he still answered to her messages even though we were in a relationship when she texted. How can I talk to my boyfriend about this whole situation that still makes me uncomfortable and also I'm worrying without a reason? I still have this strong gut feeling and I don't know how to approach the problem
PS. We have a really good relationship and we respect our boundaries, I think we had just one small fight the entire relationship because usually we discuss things


Questions: 
1. What should I say to my  boyfriend about still feeling uncomfortable with the situation?   
2. How can I talk to my boyfriend about this without accusing him of wrongdoing since I snooped through his phone? 
3. Does the regular contact from the ex crossing boundaries in the current relationship?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/1ajm04q/my24f_boyfriend31m_got_a_comment_from_his_ex_on/,t2_tkh1yfach,2024-02-06 01:24:44,24,12
"I (23F) discovered that my live-in partner for 8 months (26M) had a Google Drive folder with sexy, pretty, bikini photos of his close friends, classmates, exes, and celebrities for kamanyakan and as a sleep aid.","He doesn't allow me to access his phone, laptop, iPad, and PC, and becomes upset if I try (I did it twice, and he was very angry). He explained that this was due to his past relationship; his ex-girlfriend broke up with him after finding na nag save siya ng pictures ng ka insecuran niyang mga babae and lagi niyang inoverthink. And naka folder pa each babae. Yung iba kilala niya, classmate, friend and ex MU.

He assured me multiple times that he won't do that to me, and that he's content with our relationship and our intimate life.

Recently, I became curious about his iPad and was able to guess his passcode. 

Here's what I discovered:

1. He has a folder containing selfies of his ex. Two months into our relationship, I asked if he still had pictures of his ex on his phone. He said yes and then he showed me na he started deleting them, which gave me relief. Pero yun pala sinave niya sa google drive during sa time na kami na (4 months na kami non). 

2. He has a dummy Instagram account para pang follow ng mga sexy na babae, including those he knows but aren't his friends, and to stalk his ex. The problem is he lied about this because there was one time I sat next to him while he was on his phone and when he opened his google chrome browser sa phone niya, unang lumabas is isang dummy instagram account na naka view sa story ng ex niya, nag ask ako kung ano yun and kaninong account yun. Sabi niya old dummy account niya daw yun. Pero matagal na dawng deleted.  I asked if I can check his history sa chrome pero hindi siya pumayag and ang bilis niyang nag clear history. Pero nung na open ko yung ipad niya, i found out na hindi pa pala deleted yung instagram account and he still stalk his ex sometimes pag curious siya.

3. He saved sexy photos of his ex MU, past crush, and female friends na magaganda. I caught him doing this two months ago, and he was not even sorry kasi daw hindi daw siya nag masturbate sa pic, gusto niya lng daw isave, and he claimed to have deleted them. However, I found out he saved them again last October 8. while I was traveling (October 6 to 10.) I asked kung anong purpose ng pag save. Gusto niya lng daw tignan, masarap daw sa mata. ‚ÄúMen stuff‚Äù daw

4. I found a collection of selfies and bikini photos of his female friends na sinave niya recently lng (during our relationship). According sa screen time ng ipad, he had viewed this folder for 5-10 minutes a day nung nag travel ako (Oct 6-10).

He apologized and admitted his wrongdoing. He also mentioned that this is a typical male behavior. I'm unsure if cheating ba to. He argued that physical cheating would be worse. 

I'm deeply hurt and emotionally distressed by this betrayal.

He begged me na not to break up with him, and promised that he will not do it again, he will share all his passwords and he‚Äôll allow me na to open his devices, so I gave him a chance. 

But yesterday, umiyak ako ng grabe kasi sobrang sad ko,  but he got mad kasi parang hindi daw enough yung mga assurance na binbigay niya (24hrs palang yun since nahuli siya - didn‚Äôt bother him while he was on duty for 12 hrs so less than 24 hrs palang siya nag reassure sakin and napagod na agad siya) and decided to breakup with me kasi busy siya sa internship niya (medicine) and nauubusan daw siya ng energy mag reassure all the time kasi marami daw siyang iniisip. I felt bad so I begged him to stay. 

If ikaw nasa situation ko, pano mo to ihandle? Di rin kasi ako strong enough to leave this relationship. Is it normal for men to do this?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/17h21u1/i_23f_discovered_that_my_livein_partner_for_8/,t2_hpn6n674,2023-10-27 01:42:31,72,63
How do you respond if your Exes Wife wants to hangout with you? She‚Äôs asking me to get a coffee and have a talk but the question is ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù since there is nothing to talked about?,"
My ex (M25) got married last month. his previous girlfriend (now wife) (F23-24?) had a history of stalking me on social media during their relationship. We‚Äôve ended our relationship on end of 2017 or 2018 as far as I remembered, but it was ages ago. 

Despite me (F26) moving on to two different relationships, she still showed interest in me, frequently messaging me from dummy accounts and adding me/ blocking and adding me again on various social media platforms over the course of four years.

A month before their wedding she started following me on Instagram again. (2 months ago). (I wasn't invited to the wedding.) <‚Äî‚Äî I only included this since I am not sure if she really wanted to be friends with me and WHY. 

This morning, I received a message from her saying she wants to have dinner with me to get to know me better. ü´†

I'm not sure how to react to this since I don't know her intentions, and I've never done anything to interfere with their relationship just to be in situation like this. 

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? What did you do?

I (25F) am struggling to get past the fact that my boyfriend (27M) still looks at other women and models on social media ,"Me and my boyfriend have been together just over a year. When we first got together I did notice he followed a lot of insta model accounts on instagram and especially a lot of girls who game or are into F1. 

Since being together he agreed to unfollow them but I have noticed them still coming up in his watch history and as his top searches. 

I told him this makes me annoyed as I don‚Äôt look at other men, and it knocks my confidence to think he‚Äôs still idolising or stalking these women. He denies it totally and says he hasn‚Äôt looked once since we‚Äôve been together. But why are there still new ones coming up as top searched on his socials? If you enter 1 letter they come up as top recommended. After a year if he really wasn‚Äôt still looking surely this wouldn‚Äôt be the case? 

Of course I don‚Äôt know for sure. And I‚Äôm grateful he doesn‚Äôt cheat or interact with anyone. But I still struggle to get past the fact that he has a thing for these women - when they look nothing like me and have all these traits like gaming or F1 which I don‚Äôt have. I want to feel like I‚Äôm my man‚Äôs ideal woman and I don‚Äôt. Even though he claims I am. He gets very annoyed at me not trusting him but I‚Äôm struggling to pass it off‚Ä¶

I (21F) am a Catholic and my boyfriend (23M) is a JW and it feels like our relationship will jot work out,"I am a Catholic whilst my boyfriend going 2 years is a Jehovah‚Äôs Witness. For the first year of our relationship, I didn‚Äôt really know what his religion was and I didn‚Äôt pay no mind since wala naman sa‚Äôken iyon. And he never wanted to talk about his religion, very secretive siya about it, even until now.

Only after a year na I found out na JW siya through stalking his mother‚Äôs FB account. And only until recently did I find the courage to ask if pwede ba sa kanila to date another religion to which he said ‚Äúbawal, but we‚Äôll make it work‚Äù. 

I just feel sad and worried. I have been searching all about JW and they‚Äôre all so strict, and they do not allow to compromise. I feel so alone din since whenever my BF goes home to their province, wala akong kakilala sa mga tao sa buhay niya doon. Whilst he knows my mother, my sister and my bestfriend. Whenever he goes out with his friends (churchmates lang din), he never talks to me until he goes home na. Not to atleast make pakilala his friends or anyone. 

I don‚Äôt know how ‚Äúdeep‚Äù he is into their religion but I found out his sister is very active in her faith, I just don‚Äôt know about him. He has been saying he isn‚Äôt too proud of his religion noon and its tradition kaya he didn‚Äôt want to tell us what his religion was, but he is still very much following all of their teaching, not even just making bati ‚Äòhappy birthday‚Äô to me. 

I am so afraid of talking to him about this yet. He says we‚Äôll make it work. But I don‚Äôt know how we will. Natatakot rin ako na baka kapag pagusapan namin, doon magsstart kami magkalabo.

My boyfriend [M21] of 2 years have a history of cheating on me [F20] and now I saw he visited FB profiles of his 2 female classmates na puro thirst traps ang post.,"Bf and I have a great foundation of friendship (4 years) but cheated on me few months during our relationship (mag-2 years na sa 21 haha). Nagbago naman siya kahit papaano, kahit ang tagal and until now nasa process pa raw. Kaso ang daming times kasi na para siyang umuurong sa progress niya, biglang ginagawa niya na naman, tapos pag-uusapan namin, tapos wala na ulit, repeat. Parang nagiging cycle.

He stopped studying during pandemic to work and is now back as a freshman college. Just now, I saw he stalked the FB profiles of two female classmates na nagchat sa gc (hindi pa nagmeet ang class and online pa lang sa next days). Display pictures of the women are pretty na may pagka-thirst trap. Tapos after a few minutes nawala na yung history na inistalk niya, dinelete niya hahaha. I asked him about it and reason niya is tiningnan niya lang sino-sino yung active sa gc nila, na yung iba naman inistalk niya rin kasama ako. I checked naman kung sino sino bang active nung time na yon, meron din namang lalaki pero di niya inistalk, yung ibang active inistalk na namin ng magkasama dati. 

Madaming beses nang nangyari tong pang-sstalk niya ng girls, and syempre madaming beses ko na rin nilinaw na ayoko ng ganon. Madaming beses ko na rin tinry iwan siya, breakup, blocked, pero wala andito pa rin ako. Ewan ko, ano bang gagawin ko? Kung iiwan ko na siya, paano ba? I need advice please.

I (F20) just found out that my ka-date (m23) came from a 3-year long term relationship and as a nbsb person i somewhat overthink it lol,"We have been talking for a month now and seeing each other 3 times. (dates were roadtrip, museum, and cinema)

I stalked him after I fully know he's name and as I did that I realized that he seems to be in a long term relationship. but I did not clarify or open to it kasi naffeel or just assume ko pa lang.

Last night, I had the courage to ask him if he came
from a long term relationship and he answered, yes. 3 years. he also added na detachment is the key to happiness daw. 

at this point, I questioned myself kasi he's not really affected naman daw...eh the fact that if you loved the person youll really have a hard time to fully heal, right? because that shows how you cared and loved one person. 

pero, since he said na nasa process naman na raw kami he sees me as a potential partner (is this the intention?). we go on dates and looking forward for more. As a nbsb person, I can't help but overthink sa mga possible na mangyayari but do you guys think that he's a green flag or it's just a normal thing?? I don't know kasi minsan, yung mga sinesend nyang reels is about relationship/couple na eh wala pa naman kami sa ganung level. 

Also, naooverthink ko rin na namimiss nya raw cuddling ganon and ang nasa isip ko baka miss nya lang yung mga stuff like that and he doesn't like me as a person t____t what assurance should I get ba para not to overthink sa ganyan? hahaha tho I am really trying to be expressive and open to communicate my feelings to him naman pero at some point, I seek for advice sa friends ko na lang. what do you think?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/14tnpg6/i_f20_just_found_out_that_my_kadate_m23_came_from/,t2_8cee9fdpn,2023-07-08 07:55:06,13,13
I (22F) feel like my boyfriend (29M) is not yet ready to confront and face his father's secret with his family.,"I somehow left the title as it is since he's an avid reader here. I might twist some points to make it look like it's not our situation. So, this is not something about marriage or regarding our relationship. This is about his father (M50) whom I feel like was being secretive with his family. His father rarely go home even though he's working here in Luzon. My boyfriend is a family oriented guy and open with his family. We're already in a relationship for a year and so, I met his mother but I haven't met his father. Let's cut the story short. Months ago, my boyfriend and his family was talking about me then suddenly, I received a friend request on Facebook. There's no pictures about that person but I suspect that it is his father due to the name initials and the dummy account uses his father's middle initial. I stalked the ""About"" info and saw the dummy account followings, the followings are group of women na parang pa-revealing mga posts, there are also I think in their mid 20s and most of them are near or within my boyfriend's father's work location. I also saw a page na nagooffer ng massage with extra service. I immediately told my boyfriend about it and he has speculations also that it was his father.

A little information about his father, he's non expressive with my boyfriend's mother. Doesn't want to be touched by his wife, or sleep in the same bed. Basta, nung tumagal daw hindi na masiyado expressive father niya sa mother niya. Hindi rin gentleman at hindi masiyado kumikibo. Ang kwento ng boyfriend ko about his father is hindi raw malapit sa mga babae, may mga instances daw na sa inuman, may dumidikit na mga babae sa father niya pero his father kept on ignoring those women. I kept on insisting sa boyfriend ko nun to do some stalking about this account since baka may tinatago sa kanila pero I don't know gusto rin naman niya alamin pero 'di natuloy that time. So we just kind of somehow, shrugged it off.

So fastforward, nagmeet na kami ng father niya in their house. I expect na hindi siya masiyado kikibo. My boyfriend left us alone kasi kukuha siya ng plates sa kusina nila, until medyo chinika ako ng father niya and then his father said something na na-caught off guard ako. ""Ang cute mo pala."" Hindi ko pinansin 'yung sinabi niya since nagulat din ako kasi ang alam ko hindi expressive father niya. I shrugged it off. Then ayon, need na umalis ng father niya and decided to part ways. Bago umalis, nakwento ko na nasabihan ako ng father niya na ""cute"" daw ako pero wala 'yung mismong tono kung paano sinabi ng father niya 'yun sa akin. Nagpunta na lang kami sa mall. Kinwento ko ulit 'yon sa boyfriend ko, but this time, may tono na.

Medyo nagulat siya kasi raw ever since, wala siyang narinig na sinabihan ng Papa niya na ganon. Kahit daw mga babaeng lumalapit sa Papa niya, hindi niya pinapansin. Nagulat ako sa reaction ng bf ko kasi akala ko 'yung shinrug off ko kanina ay normal lang pero hindi pala since base na rin sa reaction ng boyfriend ko.

Bf: Sinabi niya 'yun? Gago ang creepy nun. Pagsasabihan ko nga na huwag ka sabihan nang ganun.

E ako since alam kong family oriented siya, ayaw ko magka-issue tsaka benefit of the doubt na rin.

Me: Huwag na baliw. Pero paano kung ganun nga?
Bf: Palalayasin ko siya sa bahay namin.

Narelieve ako na sinabi niya 'yun. Hindi niya ako ininvalidate. He also assured me na kung totoo nga 'yun, iiiwas niya ako sa father niya. I was groomed before when I was 15 years old and was raped din by my ex (M28) My boyfriend's family knows about this experience of mine pero not really detailed at all, but they know na may experiences ako and I am into older men/guys. I am not sure kung cause nitong pagkabothered ko dahil sa past ko, delulu ako o talagang may something wrong akong nafifeel? And since na nangyari 'yon, nabother na talaga ako nung last week pa and cinonfront ko kagabi boyfriend ko. Inopen ko ulit 'yung topic about sa dummy account ng father niya (speculation) na kung anong gagawin niya do'n? He said na may gagawin naman siya pero need niya muna magplan, but of course, benefit of the doubt din siya na baka hindi naman daw gumagawa ng kababalaghan since nandun nagstestay Papa niya sa Lola (F76) niya para alagaan. But I don't want to buy that reason, the dummy acount is what for 'di ba? Bakit need gawing secret ng father niya sa family nila? Ako I have accounts din naman but my face is posted there, and hindi ko tinatago 'yung account na 'yon sa SO ko. I feel like he's not yet ready to confront his father about this and I really have this instinct na may tinatago 'yung father niya sa kanila, not to mention na once a month or once in two months lang umuuwi sa kanila.

And at the same time, natatakot din ako na if ever totoo, ako pa maging dahilan kung masira sila ng family nila. How should I convince him to do something about this and how should I approach my boyfriend about this since kakagaling niya lang sa depression that lasted around 6 years and kakarecover niya lang ngayon?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/1c32d25/i_22f_feel_like_my_boyfriend_29m_is_not_yet_ready/,t2_8ti4tk563,2024-04-13 21:47:18,1,0
I[22M] is experiencing retroactive jealousy towards my girlfriend [23F] She had 1 ex and 2 flings and I have only 1 ex.,"For context, I have only 1 ex and she has also 1 ex but had 2 flings with other guys. So in other words, I have 2 body counts while she has 4. That fact is stucked in my mind ever since we started dating yet I still decided to go forward on our relationship because I thought I can overcome it. But we are now dating for 4 months and I cannot still get over the fact that she had done it with other 3 men while I have only done it with my only ex. I am not jealous about the fact that she has more body count than me but I am jealous about the other 3 men she'd done it with. I am constantly insecure and conscious about it. I know I am the best looking one base on appearance yet I am still insecure. She even consider the  other guy she had done it with as her FUBU or fuck buddy. That shit hurts me so bad. It felt like unfair on my side. I constantly stalk her previous flings' soc med accounts, yes I am that insecure. Even when we are getting intimate and making love, I can still picture in my mind that she was doing it with someone else. Please I need some advices. My girlfriend is great, she's the best. I love her so much and she loves me so much too, but I cannot take her past. I cannot get over her past. Tho, I wanna continue my life with her, as my partner. Help me overcome this because I want to continue living my life with my girlfriend. 
Would you please help me overcome this matter? 

Addtional context: Im maybe like this because I came from an 8 year long relationship. And everything is new to me. My ex and I were both ""first"". So I never had been with someone who had previous experiences just like my girlfriend now. I am used to be the one who gives and experience the "" First times"" ; first kisses, first intimacy, etc. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/1927lvk/i22m_is_experiencing_retroactive_jealousy_towards/,t2_5uqyje32,2024-01-09 13:55:28,1,0
I like some guy(20M) that I used to have a talking stage relationship but I have ghosted him and till now I still like him I'm a (21F),"

I have a guy(20M) that I like for six years and we have a past we have a stalking stage relationship Before but i suddenly stopped and ghosted him for the reason of being scared and not ready for any relationship and I know I'm being an asshole and coward but We are literally just a teenager that time and I'm scared that when my mother knows about it, she will be saddened so I stopped talking to him without telling him the reason and I felt really guilty and so after that months pass I still want to talk to him but didn't do anything and when I learned that he has another girl talking to I really felt jealous about it but just denying it and so many years have pass i still like him but For what I know he already have a girl he like which is I don't know who and I heard about it to my friend's friend which is someone a friend of him and I still saw him time to time since we are in the same school where we both attend to and just yesterday I had a dream and I still remember that dream, Let me tell you what i dream about.
 
I had a friend (another Friend) who went with me to a store. I'm sure there are many who know what 7/11 is. And when we were going to the glass door of 7/11, I immediately saw one of his friends, but I didn't pay attention to that, my friend (20F) and I (21F) immediately entered and when we entered, my friend went straight to where the item she my friend was looking for to buy was located, and I was at the place where the ice was located, which is just near the glass door when suddenly I saw him and we made eye contact I was embarrassed but I still smiled at him after that he walked past me then suddenly he came back to where I was and I was shocked because it was like he hugged me from behind out of nowhere then he suddenly brought his hand to me like he wanted to make a peace bomb so I do it then suddenly he whispered to me and I literally still remember that and This is what he said 'wait for me in the white garden'.

And I don't know what the white garden is or where it was located until I search for it and there's a place and And the white garden is said to be where the people who love white flowers go there so I searched again what is the meaning behind the white flower and its about purity, peace, innocence, sympathy and I search again what is the meaning behind it when i dream about white flower and it mean purity and love. Do you guy's think it's giving me a sign to confess or what?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/18zdb6w/i_like_some_guy20m_that_i_used_to_have_a_talking/,t2_r8jnivznx,2024-01-06 02:08:37,1,0
"My mother (51f) is disapproving of my (24m) relationship with my gf (25f) becuase of her background, family, and how her house looks like??","In 2021, during the pandemic I met an amazing girl and three months later I asked her to be my girlfriend. We have been together for 2 years. It was obvious in the beginning that we werent from the same social class. I am from alabang and have been going to international schools my whole life. For college I went to csb and became good enough at tagalog that I can converse with pretty much anyone. My girlfriend on the other hand is from Binan Laguna. She went to Csa and has always been a scholar. Her parents worked hard to put her through school and she worked hard to maintain her scholarship. In college she was a scholar aswell and when she graduated she got a really well paying job. 

Both of our backgrounds are very different but we still got along well and eventually started dating. My mother is a single mom and im the only child so she is very protective over me. When i first told her about having a gf she was uninterested and didnt even want to meet the girl because she didnt recognize her family name. 

My mom is very much a snob. Shes is from a rich family and went to boarding school in the states. She only likes to eat in highend restaurants and always has something to say about other peoples fashion. 

So unsuprisingly she was quite uninterested in my girlfriend. Almost two years pass. My mom met my gf once because I begged my mom to meet her. After they met mom slowly started to be more accepting. Even sending her food and gifts. I thought things were going well. Until last night. I spent the day with my gf and we were on the way home. I put my phone on silent mode and was unable to answer my moms calls. This prompted my mom to look up my gf on facebook to msg her. From there my mom started to stalk and snoop around my gfs family and see that her upbringing was very different from mine. 

When i got home, she was upset at me for choosing someone who was from an upbrining like that. She kept mentioning that her parents look terrible, that their house looks terrible, and that her families livelyhoods are pathetic. She repeated the phrase ""have i taught you nothing?"" She asked why i could not just choose someone from our own social class. 

There is obviously no way i am breaking up with my gf and whenever i try to approach the topic logically, my mom ends up getting really emotional which makes me really emotional also. How do i get my mom to understand that this is what makes me happy? How do i get her to accept my choices?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/17mlj8i/my_mother_51f_is_disapproving_of_my_24m/,t2_7ur95p0kr,2023-11-03 11:09:07,7,3
i think that my (19F) friend (20M) likes me but im not interested in him because he‚Äôs a total creep. how should i tell him?,"so i have been friends with this guy for the past few months. we‚Äôre freshmen by the way and we‚Äôre not from the city where our uni is located.

we both found out that we spoke the same regional language so we got closer since we were the only ones who could relate to each other on a lot of stuff. after that, he would sometimes request to study with me through video calls and meet-ups (only happened one time though, it was in our uni) so we got to know each other more.

and maybe because of spending time with him he became interested in me. he would message me kung kumain na ba ako, kamusta, etc. because i was too dense, i didn‚Äôt even realize that it was already considered a ‚Äútalking stage‚Äù? excuse me please pero i‚Äôve never been in a relationship before so i didn‚Äôt really know hahshshg.

but what really surprised me was that he put a childhood pic of me as his twitter header. kahit di naman kami ??? excuse the language but it‚Äôs just so fucking weird. maybe speaking for myself rin kase i stalked his twitter tas yun. saw me as his header. ang creepy lang. never revealed to him that i know about this. initially thought he wanted to be good friends w me because of familiarity like we speak the same language.

he doesn‚Äôt give off bad vibes, studious, tas circle of friends niya ay girls so i thought why not be friends too he seems like a good person (not saying that those who have a circle of guy friends are bad ha, i just view those w girl friends as approachable para saken :)).

but me as his header pic just creeps me out. eventually learned that being friends with some straight men (not generalizing all pls) is impossible for me. :)

should i leave it as it is? should i just tell him na i see him as a friend lang and ask him to remove that pic of mine because he didn‚Äôt even ask for my consent? i feel so disrespected lang.

is it ok to still have these weird feelings for my ex [m19]? is this part of moving on? [f19] here,"I had a relationship when i was still 15 y.o. it lasted for almost 3 yrs. At that time there was no problems to think about since we were still young. I broke up tho because i became guilty of hiding it behind my parent's back. We are a Christian fam and my mom kept on reminding no boyfriends til i find a job so i should obey her.

We broke up during pandemic through text and for almost half a yr i felt lonely. Add the times when there was lockdown, its only my family whom i can have f2f contact with so i cant really share my pain.

Fast forward to me at college, school gates have opened for f2f classes. We went to the same school and enrolled at the same course. This was one thing we were looking forward back then since we both want to pursue medicine. But things took a different turn and i try my best to avoid him but he doesnt hesitate to say hi to me. I just wave back and smile cause it feels... weird. The fact that back then we used to be so close together and so clingy together, now there's a big gap i need to maintain with him.

Just now, i decided to stalk his social media and his pfp has a girl i know on it. Some of his posts are with this girl. Ngl, my heart felt heavy. There's also a hind of pride within me that i should also be in a relationship again so he wont see me miserable.

I want to move on, i want to forget everything about the past because everytime i look at him, i remember and feel things i dont want to remember and feel. I hate that i remember how happy we were back then, and that happiness was just destroyed by my sense of guilt. I hate that i feel hurt when i see him in a relationship when i have no right to feel hurt anymore. It feels kinda freeing that i have no secret on my parents anymore, but it hurts at the same time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/11sugmo/is_it_ok_to_still_have_these_weird_feelings_for/,t2_vl31gujg,2023-03-16 21:39:19,1,6
"My (26M) girlfriend (26F) have been together for a year, fell out of love for me and is now seeing her ex of 5 years","I'm dividing my story into 3 sections- backstory, relationship, lastly issue (feel free to skip if you want to pero I want to give as much context as I could): 

Backstory:

We've known each other for a year now. Back then, madalas pa nga nya akong kinukulit to talk to her nung nasa talking stage pa kami. One night my friends and I were drinking and they noticed na may kachat ako so they asked me, ""bakit di mo subukan sa kanya?"" I really wanted to, so I did some stalking on her socmed. Turns out she's still with her ex kahit na magkausap kami so I really wanted to keep my distance. Pero nauusig ng mga tropa like, ""try mo pa din"" or ""save a damsel in distress"" , plus I can feel na she's really into me

One time nag aya sya na manood kami ng concert. Sabi ko ayoko, since alam kong sila pa ng ex nya (cover photo pa nga nya sa habang kachat ako lol) so I said have a closure and end things up with him before we meet. To which she did (pero as the title implies, this is a major spoiler alert)

Here comes our relationship:

We met at the concert and had a great time. She stayed at my place for a couple days kasi galing pa sya ng malayong lugar (and I was living alone in my apartment that time), and that's where all the good things happened- too good, to say the least. Ambilis ng mga pangyayari afterwards. She even got to meet my family. Pag di kami magkasama ang clingy nya super sa chats and calls, kahit na alam nyang busy ako with work and life which was medyo nakaka off-putting, pero gets ko naman 

Fast forward inaya sya ng friends nya from another province and nagstay naman sya ng ilang days doon. During that time, nawawala pagiging clingy nya sakin sa chats and calls- which is fine, para at least alam nya na need din makisama sa friends even in our relationship

One time nag chat ung ex ko before to grab her stuff na nasa bahay pa din namin and I was very open to my GF about it especially kapag usapang exes. I really wanted her to know na I've moved on and wala nang namamagitan sa aming dalawa, tho I can tell she was quite bummed up about it

Now here comes the issue:

Our relationship continued for a year. Habang ako I'm very open with her about everything, pinakilala ko sya sa family and friends, sya naman never akong pinakilala- except sa tito't tita and dalawang kapatid lang nya. Which really set me off kase kilala na ata sya ng buong angkan ko.

Now she fell out of love for me dahil di na daw ako madalas mag take ng pictures nya and i-story sya sa IG ko, along with other things.Napa ""huh????"" Ako doon, like after giving my all and sacrificing my time sa work and sa family para sa time nya and needs. Ganon ba kadali ma-fall out of love?

Eto pinakamasakit sa lahat: she's keeping her communication with her ex (26M? We never talked much about him) a secret from me. No matter how irrelevant yung conversation ninyo together, siguro naman pwede mo i-open sakin yon. But why would she even hide it from me?

Turns out while she's meeting with her friends, may times na kasama ang ex nya. Yun pala, naging kaibigan nya lahat ng mga tao doon gawa ng ex nya. ""They"" have invited her to a resort and magkasama sila ng ex nya all throughout the trip

Now she's somewhere in visayas and may plane tickets sila to Taiwan next month. Oo, kasama ang friend/s nya, pero nandun din ang ex nya.

I feel like being straight-out cheated on. Pero iniyakan nya ako, and ayaw nya akong mag overthink. She says she still misses me and kaya nya daw nagawa yun kase gulong gulo sya. I don't understand what's going on. Should I just cut her off entirely in my life?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/18gmfiy/my_26m_girlfriend_26f_have_been_together_for_a/,t2_ofewapwsr,2023-12-12 21:56:35,9,7
What was the best way to handle the messy situation regarding a breakup which involved ‚Äúsumabatan‚Äù & ‚Äúkeeping score of mistakes‚Äù,"Hi all,

First time poster here. I just wanted to ask, what could‚Äôve I done better during the breakup or how could‚Äôve I handled the situation better?


Context:
Me (27M) and my ex (26F) has been dating for over a year now. We recently broke up because of what I did and what she found out. 


1. She stalked one of my previous MUs and saw that I was still liking her pictures however she didn‚Äôt say anything. 


2. After our Zambales trip, she encouraged me to fix my IG feed (photographer) and I then proceeded to unarchive and reupload some of my previous shoots with that person (MU). She still didn‚Äôt say anything 


A few days before my exit date from our company, she then proceeded to breakup with me due to the reasons above. At first I was in shock however I needed to keep my concentration since it‚Äôs a few days before my certification exam (I passed!!) 


After the exam I kept on asking why? What‚Äôs the reason and she finally blurted those out. I told her that I only posted the photos since it looked good (dumb move) and it was to improve my feed (color coordinated/aesthetics) but that didn‚Äôt help my case. She then proceeded to explain her side in which I fully understand, posting someone else‚Äôs pictures on your feed specially someone whom you had a romantic relationship before, hurts. I told her I‚Äôm sorry and then proceeded to remove and block the person from my IG however she was very firm in her decision. 


I told her it was an honest mistake since I never thought it would be an issue since when we began dating the pictures were already there and she never showed any negative reaction. I was trying to make her understand my POV since I really didn‚Äôt know and she then proceeded to remove her pictures and reinstate the pictures that her ex-BF took of her last Nov 2022, a week after she introduced me to her parents. I‚Äôve been trying to convince her for around a week. 


Note: We began dating around Feb 2022. And she went on a trip with her ex last Nov 2022


This is the part where my patience was wearing thin. I then accused her and told her some hurtful words. Then I proceeded to make ‚Äúsumbat‚Äù for all the past misgivings that I had. 


I admit I went overboard however I just couldn‚Äôt control my anger that time and said those hurtful words. 


What could‚Äôve I done better during that time? Or what was the wisest move to explain my POV? How could I make her understand all the sacrifices (switches to higher paying job) that I took for her so she could just reconsider her decision?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/13ib51s/what_was_the_best_way_to_handle_the_messy/,t2_39jlix5h,2023-05-15 23:14:11,1,7
I (23F) is in a talking stage with my crush (23M) & idk how to emotionally detach/ not get hurt from him incase this doesn‚Äôt work out.,"Any advice how to emotionally detach? Or slow down my emotions? :((

I didn‚Äôt know talking stages would be this hard din pala, kasi sa lahat ng naka talking stage ko naging boyfriend ko sila. So wala talaga akong maraming experiences when it comes to dating since 2 lang naging ex ko. Ang hirap pala lumugar pag talking stage lang :(( kasi walang label, pero nag uupdate ganon. Nakakairita lalo pag crush mo yung tao kasi may leverage siya sayo. 

For context: this guy has been a consistent instagram story liker for months, not until may 2023 na napapansin ko na yung name nya sa mga likers and kasi inadd nya ako sa FB. Then I began to get curious sa life nya, stalked his social medias kung saan mutuals kami. Then I got interested. In short na crush talaga ak (its so unusual for me kasi bihira lang talaga ako magka crush ng diehard) tapos I prayed and kept manifesting na mag slide sha sa DM ko (kasi i dont wanna make the first move)  after 5 days nag hit up talaga sha. Then the rest is history na, everyday na kami magka talk kadalasan umaabot kami ng 2am, then theres this acknowledgement na din from both ends na na mag geget to know kami and see if we can potentially translate this to a relationship. (We haven‚Äôt met/ gone out to a date in person yet pala pero schoolmates kami). To be honest, na attach na ako kasi base sa chat, ang chill and laid back nya which is exactly my type. D ko alam if na ooverlook ko yung red flags kasi crush ko sha or wala talaga shang red flags. (Help!) 

Now the problem is, he is planning to work sa isang call center company and graveyard yung shift kasi summer term pa. Now, hearing stories about cheating sa mga ganyan na workplace, i laid out my hesitations about it, explained, and told him i might need to stop the talking stage if ever he gets to go in na sa job. (I was in a relationship kasi before na grabe yung anxiety kaya priprevent ko lang anything na might rekindle those feelings to keep my peace) and his answer was so uncertain and walang assurance, he just said if i wanna walk away he‚Äôll respect it daw. It gave me an idea na this talking stage will soon end din and parang na huhurt na ako thinking about it kasi ang attached ko na. 

Kaya how to detach po ba? How to slow down my emotions? How to not give him an easy pass kasi nga crush ko sha? (Di nya alam na crush ko sha) 


Thank you po in advance sa insights niyo! It will really help me understand these feelings. 


TLDR: how to detach from a talking stage especially if crush mo siya pero you have a hint na mag eend din soon yung talking stage.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/143eliv/i_23f_is_in_a_talking_stage_with_my_crush_23m_idk/,t2_n57j5dd9,2023-06-07 22:21:50,5,4
"I (27F) have trauma issues and the guy (29M) i love, told me that he‚Äôs tired. I‚Äôm overthinking why he‚Äôs still here despite him telling me he wants to wait and see me be a better girl for him than leave and find someone else.","TLDR: My guy friend of 2 years has been asking me out to be his girlfriend for 5 months na and I am not yet ready to enter a new relationship after my 7 year break-up. He has never pressured me to say yes agad and he is waiting for me to heal. Everyday I have accused/assumed him of doing sneaky stuff behind my back with other females until the day came he blocked me from everything and said he will not date me until I improve on my toxic behaviour. We are semi-okay na hanging out/video calls for hours after he added me back on discord. He says iloveyous back and he is talkative more on a jokey/flirty side pero less sweet na. He used to send me flowers din and tell me how much he misses me all the time.


Kahapon tinanong ko siya after namin maghang-out sa discord video call and sabi ko bakit ka nagstay? Originally ang sagot niya days ago was kasi daw he wants to stay here and wait for me to be a better girl for him. Sabi niya he loves me pero nakakapagod daw ako intindhin all the time lalo na daw nacocorner siya at hirap siyang i-explain at idefend sarili niya since ako daw yung type na kahit ni-reassure na parang hindi pa din daw good enough yung sagot for me and I keep playing investigator ganun. Sinabi niya kagabi na wala na daw siyang energy to even be mushy right now kasi nga napagod na daw siya sa mga assumptions ko tuwing lalabas siya/accusation without evidence ko, and sa mga arguments namin halos araw araw. Sabi niya he can‚Äôt be bothered to even look for anyone else at wala na siyang energy talaga and he is not looking for anyone else and he doesn‚Äôt want to be alone either. Whether daw he is tired of me or not, he still wants to be with me and choose me. Sabi ko kasi maging honest siya if he is just settling for me until he finds someone new and better with a spark, I always told him naman na if he‚Äôs done na sabihan lang ako, sabi niya uulitin daw niya he is not trying to find someone new, and sabi niya sakin if he was trying to settle, bakit nagawa daw niyang i-block ako from everything nung nareach na daw niya breaking point niya so sabi niya, proves he can leave and he is not settling for me that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs here. Mahal daw niya ako pero wala siyang energy to exert sweetness kasi exhausted nga daw siya.

I‚Äôve been cheated on multiple times po by previous exes, and dun po nagstart yung anxiety and trust issues ko and i‚Äôm trying to be better slowly but surely every day.

I want to trust him kasi he is still investing spending time and hanging out with me the whole day on his days off pero nagooverthink na po ako malala. 

May nasabi pa siya kasi nagkakwentuhan kami sabi niya why do hot girls daw mostly pick ugly sleazy guys. Sabi ko bakit ka fixated sa topic na yan is it because wish mo yung mga girls pumatol sayo instead tapos sabi niya ganito daw thinking niya noon and sabi niya hindi daw niya talaga magets why, and sabi niya a part of him feels more eligible than those guys kaya hindi daw niya maintindihan. Tinanong ko naman siya if he thinks other girls are hot right now sabi niya no, hindi daw and he only used the description it as comparison lang para makita ko daw yung pinopoint out niya.

Any opinions po? I don‚Äôt want to aggravate my overthinking since I‚Äôm in the process of building my self worth again and throwing my insecurities away. I don‚Äôt want to be the girl na forever nagpapalamon sa fears and insecurities ko and stalking his social medias. (I‚Äôm also considering therapy for my traumas).

I want to show na I‚Äôm doing my best to improve for myself to be a girl that is still worthy of him.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/13lfr8w/i_27f_have_trauma_issues_and_the_guy_29m_i_love/,t2_ayels6bkw,2023-05-19 08:27:20,2,12
"Hi, people who have not receive the closure they deserve‚Ä¶ how did you move on? Esp when he has someone new that quick...","Hello. My ex (M33) broke up with me (F25) via messenger chat last January. We had a fight and hindi kami nagkaintindihan‚Ä¶ to cut the story short it was just another ‚Äòpetty fight‚Äô.  
We were together for 2 years. I was the avoidant type, and I don‚Äôt wanna hear abusive words from him pag naga-away kasi puro nalang pagmumura and lait sinasabi niya kahit alam kong heat of the moment lang. So, I went home bc I had nowhere to go to. I wanted him to approach me first sana, kasi lahat ng recent away namin ako lang ang di makatiis lagi. After 2 days, nagpunta ako sa kanila para makausap na siya kasi di ko na talaga kaya, pero mainit pa rin ulo niya so nagdecide ako na umuwi nalang ulit. I was so sick of the words he has told me, pagmumura and all. It lasted for another 2 weeks, I was overthinking na talaga kasi hindi umaabot ng 1-week ung di namin pagpapansinan usually. But this time, 2 weeks and counting. When I messaged him hi, don na siya nagreply na ayaw niya na. He was pagod na raw to understand my mood and shits. He broke up with me via chat LANG.  
I believe he is not that type of guy so I still hold on to him. He did not unfriend me and erased all of his IG posts with me. Pero isang buwan na after nung nangyari and nababaliw na ako. I tried to contact him, left him a long message pero wala siyang reply, he blocked me then (pero late niya na nadelete ung IG posts niya). That‚Äôs when I decided na puntahan na siya sa bahay ulit and texted him na I need to find answers kasi for me it was really biglaan. We were happy naman talaga pero that fight lang nag-give up na siya. Hindi niya manlang pinaramdam sakin na napapagod na siya. Ang dami kong tanong sa sarili. Kaya tinext ko siya ng mga tanong ko, and added ‚ÄòMay iba na ba?‚Äô kahit alam kong sa sarili ko never niya magagawa sakin yun. He replied na he doesn‚Äôt want to see and talk to me anymore, wala raw siyang ibang babae, wag na raw ako mag-overthink. I accepted na, kasi medyo nakuntento ako sa sinabi nyang wala siyang iba.  
This time‚Ä¶ I had a feeling lang bigla. I tried to stalk him, found out he has a new girl. Masakit, pero curiosity kills nga talaga. I found out that they have been talking a week after nung last text niya sakin saying wala siyang iba! And magfofocus daw siya sa sariili niya! I can‚Äôt confirm kelan sila nagkamabutihan kasi lahat ng friends and family niya di ako pinapansin since then. My friends said baka naguusap na sila during our relationship‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm so fucked up bc if it‚Äôs true, bakit di ko napansin? ‚òπ  
I am still in pain‚Ä¶ I trusted him because I know he is not that kind of guy. Hindi niya ko ‚Äòlolokohin‚Äô or ibebetray ng ganyan. I knew and I felt how much he really loved me‚Ä¶ or ang tanga ko lang talaga. All I wanted was closure, yung kakausapin niya ko in person and makikipaghiwalay siya in person pero no‚Ä¶ kahit ngayon wala kong natatanggap. Tapos ganito pa malalaman ko. Ang hirap‚Ä¶  
I am truly sorry for the rant and magulong kwento‚Ä¶ I just don‚Äôt know what to do. All of the people in my life naging friend niya and I had no one to talk to because I don‚Äôt want to ruin his image. They all believe na he will not do this type of shit. But f\*ck, I really don‚Äôt know what to do. How to move on without closure? How to accept the fact that he is seeing someone na that quick? How can I erase the thought na he is not the good guy I thought he really was‚Ä¶? How can I forget him?  
TL;DR‚Ä¶ Ex broke up with me via chat, without any closure. Found out he has another girl a week after our last convo saying he doesn‚Äôt have any girl and he just wants to focus on his self.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/13s2373/hi_people_who_have_not_receive_the_closure_they/,t2_c2f74v3o1,2023-05-26 11:34:56,15,26
Me (M19) and my girlfriend (F19) have been dating for months but I don't know if she's just using me as a rebound.,"Hey everyone, I need your help. This will be a long story and I appreciate it if you listen. I just need your opinions on this and any advice is highly appreciated. Thank you!

Me and my girlfriend have been dating for months now, we're a relatively new couple but in that short time she made me very, very happy. She always puts the effort, made sure she has time for me, makes me her priority and gives me gifts, is clingy, and understands me in the times I'm having a hard time. It almost seems like she's the perfect girl any guy would want and frankly I believe it too. She's just too good to be true. Up until now, I'm starting to believe that.

We met December of 2022, I courted her nung January and we started dating February. We've been through a few dates, all went well. Like I said, she always made sure I was happy and I appreciate it more than she could ever know.

However, there was an incident that happened when we started dating and it made me question everything there is about what's real or what's not. Her ex contacted her and they called. They didn't text, called. I didn't know how long they called, but she told me they called. Apparently, her ex found out that she had a new man and of course like all psychopath exes, he wanted to come back to her just so he can prove a point and that he's better. Fortunately, she said no and of course that's the least you can do about someone that hurt and treated you like trash. 

Speaking about her ex and past relationships, this specific one is the one that destroyed her life. Saying that this guy is the worst is an understatement. (Physical and Mental Abuse, Sexual Assault is one of the FEW things he did to her. Everytime I think about it, my blood boils.) They dated for one year, and here's the first thing that bothers me; they broke up November of 2022. One month only after we met.

Which leaves me on the next thing that bothers me: Even with all that, She brings him up in times, defends him when I talk badly about him, and she STILL has contact with her ex. Although they barely talk, her ex still interacts with her social medias in a way. I stalked her Facebook profile and I even saw that she's still friends with him. She also has contact with his family, more specifically his mom and his aunt. Her approach to this is that they don't have bad blood with each other, the only problem is her ex. Is it normal to feel bothered by this? Or maybe it's just me overthinking again? What can I do to stop thinking about it? I'm scared to confront her about this because she might feel like I'm controlling her. What should I do?

Although I questioned her about it, she said that she has in fact moved on with her ex, but not the things that he did. It's understandable, considering that she went through so much and she didn't deserve all that. That's why it hurts me writing this post because of a person I love. I really love her so much, and I don't wanna lose her. It pains me to think that maybe she's just using me to forget about her ex and I really hope it doesn't turn out that way. Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you.

"6 years on and off in dating stage, [F20] and [M21], after I broke up with him last January,I still have feelings for him. Balikan ko ba siya?","**TL;DR I still have feelings for him despite both of us being toxic and wants to get back with him**

I\[F20\] and my ex \[M21\] been dating on and off since 2017 which is nasa high school pa lang kami, sa first 3 months, okay naman siya and masaya dahil ayun start pa lang ng relationship. Masyadong mahaba if ikukwento ko lahat ng details but inend ko yung relationship the first time kasi I felt disrespected sa sinabi niya. I think it is because hindi pa talaga ako ready sa mga ganoong topic. Nag usap kami and ayun we got back together. Nag Senior Highschool na kami and ayun nakipagbreak ulit ako kasi ayun he disrespected me again. Nagkabalikan naman kami ulit kasi ayun nananaig pa rin yung feelings namin sa isa't isa.

Last 2020, which is start na ng college life namin, naging busy na ako at nagwork online since I have to support myself and family. nawalan na ako ng time sa kanya and ayun eventually, nilayuan ko siya kahit hinahabol niya ako. Dumating yung 2021, nakipagbalikan ako sa kanya and we started dating again. I ended the relationship ng biglaan dahil na rin I can't see any progress and hindi niya sinunod yung usapan namin which is huwag muna ipagsabi sa tropa namin na nagkabalikan kami.

This last quarter ng 2022, I messaged him na nagsabi na I still have feelings for him and it is up to him kung ano ang gusto niyang mangyari about it. He decided naman na maging dating stage kami na which I agree on, sa una palang medyo frustrated na ako sa kanya since he doesn't have time for me kahit 1-2 hrs a week lang. Super focused niya sa acads. Nag open naman ako about it and ayun naglaan naman siya pero ayun kahit ganoon, I still feel na parang nakakaabala ako sa kanya. Naging open naman kami sa mga dapat ayusin, I even told him na sa 2 months, hindi ako happy sa realtionship namin. Nakikita ko naman na he is trying pero ayun wala pa sa bare minimum yung pagtreat niya sa akin. He even forgot my brithday and naalala niya ay hapon na. Nagdahilan siya na hindi naman daw medyo mahalaga sa kanaya ang birthdays.Dumating sa point na parang nauubos na ako at hindi na talaga masaya. We tried naman until December. Magkausap kami almost morning na yun and medyo napressured niya ako sagutin ang tanong na very personal for me. Ginaslight ko pa ang sarili ko that time na okay lang 'to, normal pagusapan ng couple. I realized after ilang araw na I felt disprecpected. Magakausap kami and I confronted him na hindi talaga kami compatible pero ayun sinabi ko na iend na lang ung relationship kasi di ko din maibibigay for now ang mga magiging needs niya sa future. I am not a fan of physical touch which is his love language. I'm still trying since may phobia ako sa touch.

3 weeks after namin iend, he messaged me saying na may ibigay daw siya. Akala ko ay magbabalik siya ng gamit pero he gave me a gift. He even insisted to give me a ride home pero I didn't accept the offer. I asked for explanation sa binigay niya and he said na he was unfair daw and he wants to make up for that. 2 weeks after that, I blocked him in all of my social media accounts and he messaged me all of the sudden sa dummy account ko and I explained na I blocked him because I want to move on.

Okay naman ako sa first 4 months, nag grieve ako noong 1st month. I even tried talking to someone online and we met as friends lang naman. I end up being happy naman kaso kinabukasan I realized na ayun same ang nararamdaman ko kapag kasama ko siya at yung ex ko. Naalala ko lang yung ex ko sa kanya since medyo same sila and ayun I stalked the reddit account of my ex and sabi niya ay mag momove on na raw siya. After that, nagrelapse malala and parang bumalik ulit yung feelings ko ng buo. I end the convo with the guy also. I am feeling the same for 2 weeks na parang biglang nagburst ulit ang feelings ko for my ex. Like may part of me na gusto ko siyang balikan. What should I do about it?

To add more info, hindi boto ang friends and family ko sa kanya kasi I am too good for him daw. Naiinis na mga friends ko kapag binabalikan ko siya. I can see naman sa kanya na he is trying to be better. I admit din na parehas kaming may toxic traits.

[F24] in a relationship with (M35). We have been together for 6 months. LDR. I have been arguing with my bf for months and it is affecting him.,"im 24F. independent since 16. i had an ex bf for 3 yrs and that man made me insecure in my life. example: back then i was so fit, pretty, workin out. he got insecure so he tells me bad things that lowered my self esteem. he compares me to his ex gf - that im not good enough, mabuti pa raw ung nasa bahamas, may masters degree. ung ex gf nya daw beauty queen.  he was very toxic. i tot he was loving me, but looking back he manipulated me. i was 18 at that time, he was 10 yrs older than me. after the relationship i stayed single for 3 yrs. and entered this new relationship of mine we are in 6 months now. LDR.  
he lives in the US. ako andito sa pinas. he is 11 yrs older than me. sa simula po, ,sweet naman kami, we love each other. he keeps on sending me flowers every month (how deep is ur love? üòÜ) until one day i changed. inaaway ko po sha, arguing everyfreakinday. i always initiate the fight. for 4 months we keep arguing, to the point where in i was jealous with his ex gf of 7 yrs, everything about her. i hate her. i get insecure cause they are in the same community and church in the US.  
i stalked her. her family her friends. i get insecure with the ex gf kasi sabi nya ginawa nya lahat para sa babae na un, pero di sakin?  i told my boyfriend about it. he gave me assurance, he affirms me. but its not enough. everytime we fight he would literally cry because he cant handle me anymore. sabi pa nga nya ""first time nyang magka jowa na parati nag aaway"" and so i came up a solution. my love language is words of affirmation -never got that in my family plus the trauma i had from my 3 yrs ex. i told my new bf to constantly affirm me, everyday. he did that - but he got tired of me. he said its suffocating. i asked him to be sweet again just like the first months when we were together - he tried - still not the same cause he thought of the fights. the fights we fought affected everything. he is an avoidant type of person, he would turn off his phone and talk to me the next day so that we wont fight anymore. and im this anxious person , every time he does that - my anxiety is killing me to death. i turned into a toxic person. i want more of his attention. im very insecure.  
as for me: I HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR HELP!!! \*i go to church - maybe because i lack of faith and maybe i need to socialize more \*as i mentioned i have bpd - i got bpd when i was 18, stopped medication. and my friend told me that i still need to talk to a therapist cause im still not clear. i will have my counseling next saturday. \*i always ask my half sister about my emotions - if its right or no. \*i always listen to Dr. K, i listen to wizardliz, i watch ted talks, i watch anime, i watch movies \*i just went to the gym 4 days ago - i enrolled 6 months!!!!!!!! 5am in the morning!!!!! \*i read self help books \*im planning to learn new musical instrument , and planning to enrol dance class  
\--- i do these things to become a better person. i didnt tell my bf about this, i want to come up as a healthy person, by that i can be healthy into him.and if u are wondering if we are still together - yes we are still together.  
right now, im withholding my love for him. people on tiktok would say ""dont show much of love to the man, cause they will leave u if they get what they want"". guard ur heart. dont expect much. dont do efforts fpr that man, let him chase u. now i reply to him - one word and im very cold to him. sometimes i dont reply just to avoid small fights. im also afraid if i risk too much sa love baka mawala ko sarili ko. but deep inside i want to loveeee him, i want to show everything for him.  
im a very good person, im a very good friend. if u are my friend, i will treasure our friendship - its just that with my boyfriend , im a different person.  
problema ko talaga utak ko, pwde po ba ipa brainwash to? pero seryuso po, pano po ba maging healthy gf? napaka unfair po kasi para sa kanya if i keep on treating him badly.tenchuu so muchi",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/15rjogt/f24_in_a_relationship_with_m35_we_have_been/,t2_7q6qsclb,2023-08-15 13:47:01,1,0
"I [19M] found out that my boyfriend [19M] has been using another Twitter account to meet up with random ""alters""","I'm gay and ive been with my boyfriend nang mahigit isang taon na. Ever since we met, never ko syang nakitaan ng tendency to cheat or mangaliwa in general. We both live in a province in the Greater Manila Area and attend the same school.  
  
2023 has been a very good year for us, though August-December of 2022 was a kinda dark time in our relationship; away-bati, ganon. The first time na nakitaan ko siya ng sign of the slightest hint of cheating was in October, when I saw grindr in his playstore search history and at the same time, a screenshot ng convo sa grindr but i couldn't read it since ni-swipe ko agad, katabi ko kasi sya nung time na yon.  
  
Then, umamin siya during one of our fights in November na he did install the app and have conversations when we fought last September. Sabi niya he did that just to vent out and dinelete din niya right away since he said he thought it was wrong. I consulted this to my friends and they said it was a form of cheating na, pero pinalampas ko na lang and moved forward with the relationship.  
  
Fast forward to a few weeks ago in early May 2023, I was browsing his phone, and I opened his Twitter to see a completely different account from his real account. It was full of pornographic content and yung mga finafollow niya, lahat either alters or basta nsfw accounts. Tbh this wasn't a surprise and it wasn't a big deal for me since I watch porn din naman. I didn't tell him na I discovered this account.  
  
Kaso when I got curious and stalked his nsfw account last Sunday, I found out na he had replied to a certain post na nagpapa-meet up in a particular city in Metro Manila, nagreply siya. This reply dated only a few weeks ago, considering din na April 2023 lang binuo yung account according sa bio nya. Naconfirm ko agad na siya yon, with the intent to meet up with an alter and do ""stuff"" since at the time na nagreply sya sa post na yon, nasa metro manila siya away from me, celebrating his birthday with family.  
  
When I saw this, natulala ako for quite some time before crying. What was more painful was nagkita kami kinabukasan non, pinuntahan ko siya sa manila to celebrate our long-planned first anniversary; without me even knowing he was trying to meet up with someone and do ""stuff"" the day before.  
  
To this day, I've only told a single close friend of mine about the entire situation. Hindi ko pa siya kinoconfront and I currently don't plan to. Graduating SHS students kami and the next few months are very crucial for us both since transition na to college, so I'm trying to hold back muna. We already have a lot of major plans for college, especially financial plans, since we're planning on entering the same university, but tbh after everything I just mentioned, I'm really not sure if dapat ko pa bang ituloy with him.  
  
What's bothering me is, bukod sa parang wala syang ka-guilt guilt na nararamdaman after doing that, continuing to treat me like normal and sweetly hanggang ngayon, sobrang casual lang ng pagkakareply nya sa post na yon, as if sanay na sanay na siya sa ganong ganap. Not to mention, last december, after another major fight, nakipagayos sya agad sakin since he wanted me to accompany him magpacheck up since he was in great pain and showing symptoms of a particular STD (magaling na sya now, and not HIV). So ngayon, napapaisip ako, what if he had met up during the period na magkaaway kami last December? What if madaming beses na pala siyang nakipagmeet-up kung kani-kanino, lalo na't April 2023 lang ginawa yung twt acc na nadiscover ko, what if may account pa pala siya before and doon siya nagseset ng meet ups?  
  
And most of all, maiintindihan ko pa na magagawa niya yon kapag hindi kami okay, pero when he replied to that post a few weeks ako, we were totally fine. Okay na okay kami nung time na yon. Nahihirapan na akong magtiwala kasi ngayong okay kami nagagawa niya yon. Aside from worrying about my health as we are quite sexually active, what bothers me most is how cool he is and seemingly guilt-free about what he's done/is doing.  
  
I don't plan on breaking up with him, I don't plan to confront him since hindi ko kaya, but this is really taking a toll on my peace of mind and I feel like I should do something, but I don't know. He's literally perfect, a walking green flag and has all positive characteristics one could ever ask for in a partner, but this issue isn't a small deal na basta basta ko lang dapat palagpasin.  
  
I need advice.  
  
tldr: need advice for what to do for a cheating boyfriend meeting up with random alters online, haven't confronted him yet and he seems awfully cool about it. are incoming college students with major plans and i dont intend to break up, should i?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/13sbwcu/i_19m_found_out_that_my_boyfriend_19m_has_been/,t2_mxfkv6gd,2023-05-26 20:29:36,3,3
