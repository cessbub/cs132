"i (25F) want to move out because my mother (46F) is physically, emotionally and mentally abusive and i need a safer space to heal. ","hi redditph! it‚Äôs my first time posting here but before i get this off my chest, i just wanna say i appreciate all of you here.

so, here goes. (TW: abuse, sexual harassment, suicide attempt)

short bg, i‚Äôm 25F and the eldest daughter of a broken family. parents are separated but both already have their own partners now. i have 2 younger brothers, aged 23 and 16. 

i‚Äôve only been working for 2+ months because i graduated at 24. i never stopped school, i just transferred schools due to 3 separate incidents involving sexual assault, sexual harassment from a prof and theft by fraud. 

why am i telling you this? because it‚Äôs part of the reason why i want to move out‚Äîmy mother did not offer me support in circumstances like these wherein i needed the counsel of a parent. 

she didn‚Äôt believe i was sexually assaulted by a classmate. she instead screamed at me and asked me if i was drunk when it happened, what i was wearing, and if the guy who assaulted me was my boyfriend. (did not drink, was wearing my uniform and the guy was bi‚Äîhe had a bf and all.) i reported it to my former uni but also to no avail.

she never did anything about my prof who continuously harassed me for 2 years. i explained to her countless times that he kept asking me out to dinner and drinks, just me and him. he also keeps inviting me to chat through secret conversations in messenger. i never budged so he failed me on one of his classes. i lost my chance to be a dean‚Äôs lister because of him. she just shrugged it off like it was nothing.

although, she did something to my classmate/dormmate who failed to pay her share for rent that she borrowed from us. she had her blottered at 2 barangays. 

these are just a few examples of the challenges i faced in life. since then, i‚Äôm sad to say, i had to go through worse stuff and my mother still wasn‚Äôt there even after i reached out. 

apart from that, there‚Äôs also the pathological lying, violent tendencies and deep unresolved anger issues. 

lately i just realized she constantly lies about our family. she had been telling people that she paid for my tuition even if my dad did. (he rightfully deserves the credit.) the worst one was one time we were together and someone asked if i was her daughter, she denied it. 

there‚Äôs also the violence i can‚Äôt take anymore. whenever she gets upset with us while driving, she goes into a road rage. she speeds through highways to get her point across. she throws things at us and somehow i always get the brunt of it. the worst one happened last year and i finally had the courage to record it (sound recording). it was clear in the audio that she was hitting me while i was telling her it hurts. 

in 2014, i was diagnosed with major depressive disorder during my parents‚Äô initial break up. in 2020, i relapsed and (shamefully & regretfully) tried to take my own life. now i even developed severe anxiety and a slight eating disorder. i‚Äôm only 38kg at 5‚Äô2‚Äù. 

there are still nights when i feel too overwhelmed. but i never went to my mother again. i‚Äôm more scared of hearing what she‚Äôll say than of hearing my own last breath. 

i know that i make mistakes, sometimes it‚Äôs really my fault why she‚Äôs mad. i‚Äôm not the perfect daughter. i already constantly beat myself up for it‚Äîwithout them needing to add to it. 

but i finally see now that i don‚Äôt have to be perfect to be loved and cared for. i don‚Äôt deserve to be hurt anymore.

right now, my simple wish is to start my healing journey, far away from her. to have my own safe space, to establish new boundaries and to have a place to finally start living after being on survival mode for so long. 

i worry about my brothers but after i asked them, they confirmed that she never hit them, unlike me. and they know enough not to depend on her for emotional support. 

one of my brothers will be graduating and working soon too. but i promised my youngest brother that they both have the option to live with me if they wish. i only survived because of them. i want to give them a better life. 

but the thing is, even if my mother has been a great burden to my emotional, mental and physical wellbeing, she is still my mother. i still want to move out with her approval and blessing. i still want to support her financially and maybe when time comes, even more than that. because maybe i‚Äôm not the only one who needs therapy. i want to help her. when she‚Äôs ready too. 

me, i‚Äôm finally ready to put myself first. but how do i even start telling her that i‚Äôm moving out? do you have any advice for a situation like mine?

thanks, redditph! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/1armukf/i_25f_want_to_move_out_because_my_mother_46f_is/,t2_pid2dds1a,2024-02-16 02:48:15,1
Im currently talking/dating someone that came from an abusive relationship for 2years hes (24M) and I (22F) and I want to know if I should still push through or not,"I (22F) now single for a year now, im running on good energy and somehow stable mentally. I met this guy on that app and weve been talking for good weeks now.
Weve been on dates and really did hit it off. But one night we just had a serious talk about our pasts and that he revealed abt his abusive ex. It washed me down to feeling sorry for him because he even have photos of him having bruises and wounds from his ex. It was so TOXIC that he had to leave, now I dont know. I want to give him some genuine love and care but at the same time im scared if Id push thru this. I dont want him to reflect his traumas on me. I fought and cried my way out of my past relationship and I dont think I can handle one that can cause me pain again. Although, my bestfriend (23F) also was a victim of physically abusive relationship and is now in a happy and stable one. Help, coz theres a side of me that wants to date him and give him genuine love and a side of me just wanting him to be my friend. I dont know how people with traumas love a person after loving such abusers im scared that he will often find patterns about his past that secures him (abusive patterns) and I dont want to be his punching bag of traumas. Please give me advices on what to do I really need it thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/156ibko/im_currently_talkingdating_someone_that_came_from/,t2_uitp7um7,2023-07-22 20:03:02,3
"My (21F) boyfriend (22M) tells me that he loves me, but he consistently hurts me (emotionally and mentally)","It has been a year since we began our relationship, and he still seems unsure of what he wants. We agreed to be transparent and truthful with each other, but we find ourselves arguing for the same reasons repeatedly. After each argument, we discuss ways to improve and make resolutions to prevent future conflicts. However, none of these solutions seem to manifest effectively, as he often forgets and fails to learn from his mistakes.

Another issue is his lack of emotional openness during our arguments. While I openly express my feelings, he tends to blame me for my traumas and emotions. When confronted directly about his mistakes, he initially denies them, leading to prolonged arguments and exhaustion. He even resorts to shouting at me, despite my repeated requests for him to stop. This constant cycle of conflict requires me to constantly adjust and make unilateral efforts to maintain our relationship.

I am always willing to invest time and energy in our relationship, even though we live 12 kilometers apart. However, when I request the same from him, he often cites busyness as an excuse. This becomes even more disheartening when he readily agrees to sex but shows reluctance towards fulfilling my simple requests, such as inviting him out to eat.

This one-sided dynamic has become deeply frustrating. Even on our anniversary, my attempt to surprise him with an air fryer (something he both needs and desires) was met with no reciprocation. I had worked hard to save for this gift, and I had planned it for months.  I don't need grand gestures; even the smallest effort would be appreciated. Not only did I receive nothing in return, but he also failed to make any effort for our date, leading to a disappointing outcome. 

I just want my love reciprocated. I'm tired of self-doubt despite knowing I'm not at fault. I prioritize him and give him what's normal in a relationship. I just want to feel loved and appreciated, and I want him to make the slightest effort and learn from his mistakes.

What did I ever do wrong? Should I remain in this relationship, or are there any steps I can take to improve it?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/18fm85z/my_21f_boyfriend_22m_tells_me_that_he_loves_me/,t2_vkj0wkr3,2023-12-11 12:28:02,9
Is there a way for the emotionally abused boyfriend (28M) to have the full custody of his baby (3B) from his emotionally abusive girlfriend (28F)?,"May way ba para mapunta sa lalaki yung baby dahil sobrang abusive ng girlfriend nya? Not physically but emotionally. Lately lagi nasasabihan yung lalaki ng kung ano ano (""demonyo ka"", ""wala kang bayag"", ""gago ka"" at marami pang degrading words) ng girlfriend nya at lagi pinanakot sakanya na ilalayo sakanya ang bata. May times na pinapahiya na sya sa mga kaibigan nya, kaibigan ng babae at pamilya nya.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/122uosc/is_there_a_way_for_the_emotionally_abused/,t2_6j389n8kq,2023-03-27 02:17:46,2
My GF tells me to leave her because she might cheat on me because of her past,"I'd appreciate if you fully read the text. Thank you.

Me (28M) and my girlfriend (26) are 14 months already into our relationship. Regardless to say, we're in a rough patch right now, so I'll be direct as much as possible.

She was sexually abused many times in the past before I first met her, and she is a legal PWD cardholder because of psychosocial issues. Back in 2018 or 2019, she was diagnosed for at least three disorders, including PTSD and MDD. She took medication until she stopped. I don't yet know when she stopped taking it.

During those years of taking medication, she was still with her ex, who had physically and sexually abused her more than a few times. They broke up in February 2021, after 5 years of relationship, when she found out he cheated on her.

I matched with her on a dating app on November that year, and we started dating on December. On February, we got together officially.

Yesterday, she went back to the psychiatrist to get a medical certificate. After her online psych session, she was crying and I asked why. She said the doctor ordered her to take medication again. She told me that taking that medication makes her numb, since it has side effects that makes her indifferent or apathetic.

She also confessed that she felt SHE MIGHT CHEAT ON ME because of the medication's side effects. She admitted to me that she cheated on her ex then by going on a date with another guy, whom she refused to identify. She did not want to elaborate further what happened with the other guy. But she said she was taking medication then so she didn't feel anything at all when she did it.

Now, she said I could go or I can leave her so I wouldn't risk getting cheated on by her if she takes that medication, which she really fears might damage our relationship and hurt me. She even calls herself a forever cheater for betraying her abusive ex.

I just want to know, what can I do or say to her? What can I do to save this relationship? My heart aches while I'm writing this. I appreciate any sort of help, thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/12ufn7w/my_gf_tells_me_to_leave_her_because_she_might/,t2_9pot9rpre,2023-04-22 03:37:13,16

A tragic story of my life. [Long Story],"Hi! Newbie here Age [26] I am a teenage mom at the age of 17 way back 2012 and been single mom for 2 years. Physical abuse ang unang tatay ng anak ko and drug addict kaya nag hiwalay kami. I had been in relationship with another guy during my college. Wag nyo ko ijudge agad graduate po ako. I'd thought kami na for a lifetime we've been together for 6 years and had 2 kids na. But during those years pinanindigan ko na lang yung sarili ko na hanggang ulirang ina na lang ako at wala ng pangarap. Inalagaan ko yung mga anak ko sa kung ano ang kaya nyang iprovide samin. Minsan i have extra work sa mga kapatid ko to sustain our daily needs. Sa loob din ng 6 years napakaraming pang ccheat na ang naranasan ko. 8 girls in total. Pikit mata ko na lang kinakalimutan at nanghihingi ng pasensya sa mga naging karelasyon nya kahit ang sakit sakit na. Para lang sa mga bata. Pero naubos din ako. Napagod ako. Bukod sa ako na ang ulirang ina ay isa din akong dakilang anak para sa tatay ko na inaalagaan ko nung buhay pa dahil stroke and bedridden. At imbis na may emotional support ako sa lalaking pinagkatiwalaan ko ng buong buo, niloloko lang pala ako. He also been a gambler sa online sabong, playing cards sa mga tropa at kung ano ano pang online games. Buong buhay ko tinuon ko na lang sa pag aalaga sa mga responsibilidad ko. Nakipag hiwalay ako sa kanya. Sa dami ng dahilan. Year 2021 sumugal ako para mag work. Pero hindi ko kinaya yung nature ng work then I met this guy online (foreign) and we had late night talks habang nasa work ako during my stay. He advised me na umuwi samin at patuloy kong alagaan ang tatay ko sya na daw bahala sa sarili kong finances since hindi ko kinaya yung work umuwi ako. Na meet nya tatay ko on virtual pag ka uwi ko and 2 weeks after that namatay ang tatay ko. Hindi na kinaya. Now I am 1 year and 4 months na with my boyfriend abroad we met 4x na personally i visit him in singapore and i have my corporate work as a banker living independently. Pero kinakain ako ng emotional breakdowns ko dahil namimiss ko yung mga anak ko wala sakin. Hindi ko magampanan ang pagiging ina physically dahil feeling ko hindi ako handa. Natatakot ako na magalit sakin yung boyfriend ko which is ang tagal kong wala communications sa mga bata. Araw araw akong umiiyak gabi gabi akong nag bbreakdowns kapag hindi ako naging busy sa work. I never ever had any socialize dahil 24/7 akong on call sa kanya kasi parehas lang ng time dito sa PH. Gusto kong magwala bakit ganito yung naging sitwasyon ng buhay ko. üò≠",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/zl0j9j/a_tragic_story_of_my_life_long_story/,t2_uye82hnq,2022-12-14 00:56:38,0
I [21F] am going through a distressing time with my current partner [20F] of our current status in our almost 3-year relationship. The 3-year itch is a real thing.,"We talked about this last chance but it's really solely on me, my other half gave me the ultimatum. Our relationship isn't perfect just like everybody else. The recent issue was due to miscommunication that led to where my partner and I are now. 

We had a fight, my partner made fun of me for getting a zero in a certain course and I took offense on that one knowing we had a past issue about micro-cheating and I felt like at that exact moment I was being cheated again because my other half chooses to acknowledge and praised someone else achievement over mine. 

I was really mad at that time, I vent out some of what I felt on my dummy account, and I was really pissed off about this one block mate of mine that keeps bragging shit to me, and I posted about that, but my other half thought that specific post was meant for them, but I was pertaining to my block mate who's gotten really into my nerves. I miscommunicated that, I was too late to explain everything because my partner already absorbed what I said. 

We were mad at each other, profanity and everything. I tried explaining things and I wanted to mend it. We both had our wrongdoings, but I had it worse. When I became persistent in making it right with this last shot. I said just give me this last chance and I will leave you be without question or explanation; I will respect that if I mess things up again. My other half perceived my move as me being controlling, manipulative, creepy, and obsessive. That's why I think I fucked up big time around this time.

 In addition to that, there were unexpected events that made our situation worse than it is now. Now, my partner's family knows our relationship and my other half received physical violence and verbal abuse from them because of us being together. My other half is not accepted for who they are. 

We had an agreement about this last chance and If I mess things up again which leads to making my other half feel that unpleasant feelings again, doesn't matter if it's only one mistake then it's over. Right now, we're trying to rebuild everything, we will start with civil interaction and slowly progress back to being casual and back to romantic interactions, but we still have that label until my other half is comfortable again around me. T

his will take time because I don't think my partner trusts me enough that I can make things right and better this time around. I'm having a hard time on what things I should consider; everything feels uncertain even though my other half gave me assurance that they will try to compromise not fully for now but little by little and slowly until we get back. I have to make double efforts in this one. Is it really possible to rebuild a relationship from scratch? **What things can a person do to be able to regain someone's feeling of security and comfort around them as well as how to work this out without losing yourself in the long run?**",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/173nnf3/i_21f_am_going_through_a_distressing_time_with_my/,t2_4d73zrqy2,2023-10-09 17:33:13,1
Me (M19) and my girlfriend (F19) have been dating for months but I don't know if she's just using me as a rebound.,"Hey everyone, I need your help. This will be a long story and I appreciate it if you listen. I just need your opinions on this and any advice is highly appreciated. Thank you!

Me and my girlfriend have been dating for months now, we're a relatively new couple but in that short time she made me very, very happy. She always puts the effort, made sure she has time for me, makes me her priority and gives me gifts, is clingy, and understands me in the times I'm having a hard time. It almost seems like she's the perfect girl any guy would want and frankly I believe it too. She's just too good to be true. Up until now, I'm starting to believe that.

We met December of 2022, I courted her nung January and we started dating February. We've been through a few dates, all went well. Like I said, she always made sure I was happy and I appreciate it more than she could ever know.

However, there was an incident that happened when we started dating and it made me question everything there is about what's real or what's not. Her ex contacted her and they called. They didn't text, called. I didn't know how long they called, but she told me they called. Apparently, her ex found out that she had a new man and of course like all psychopath exes, he wanted to come back to her just so he can prove a point and that he's better. Fortunately, she said no and of course that's the least you can do about someone that hurt and treated you like trash. 

Speaking about her ex and past relationships, this specific one is the one that destroyed her life. Saying that this guy is the worst is an understatement. (Physical and Mental Abuse, Sexual Assault is one of the FEW things he did to her. Everytime I think about it, my blood boils.) They dated for one year, and here's the first thing that bothers me; they broke up November of 2022. One month only after we met.

Which leaves me on the next thing that bothers me: Even with all that, She brings him up in times, defends him when I talk badly about him, and she STILL has contact with her ex. Although they barely talk, her ex still interacts with her social medias in a way. I stalked her Facebook profile and I even saw that she's still friends with him. She also has contact with his family, more specifically his mom and his aunt. Her approach to this is that they don't have bad blood with each other, the only problem is her ex. Is it normal to feel bothered by this? Or maybe it's just me overthinking again? What can I do to stop thinking about it? I'm scared to confront her about this because she might feel like I'm controlling her. What should I do?

Although I questioned her about it, she said that she has in fact moved on with her ex, but not the things that he did. It's understandable, considering that she went through so much and she didn't deserve all that. That's why it hurts me writing this post because of a person I love. I really love her so much, and I don't wanna lose her. It pains me to think that maybe she's just using me to forget about her ex and I really hope it doesn't turn out that way. Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you.

TL;DR: Me and my girlfriend have been dating for months but I don't know if she's just using me as a rebound.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/13qchhk/me_m19_and_my_girlfriend_f19_have_been_dating_for/,t2_bqjlch7ii,2023-05-24 13:31:33,5
I (27F) can't break up with my bf (31M) but I need to soon before we move in together this coming weekend,"God I am so ashamed to be writing this. Throwaway account because he follows my main... Also warning I talk about sex in this a bit...

I (27F) am having a really hard time breaking up with my (31M) boyfriend. We've been together about 6 months. I'll try to be detailed but not write a novel.

We met about 9 months ago in a education setting (being a little discrete here lmao or else it'd be kind obvious to everyone we know). It was a virtual setting and we just hit it off instantly. Immediately, diehard best friends. He fell in love with me and I fell in love with him in a matter of like 8 weeks. I was VERY FRESHLY coming out of a 6 year marriage and I was very emotional and hurt from that. But he was so kind and comforting. I felt like from him I was getting love, reassurance, and support that I've never gotten from anyone before. We planned on meeting in person for the first time after about the 9-10 week mark.

I was so nervous to meet him and I'm very very weird about sex, I told him a few times that I didn't want to have sex the first time we met in person. I had only every had sex with my ex before and I had had some not so good experiences that made me want to wait. He assured me I'd feel comfortable enough with him that I wouldn't have those concerns. When I pressed him by what that meant he was always pretty vague.

That combined with the fact that I was so raw from coming out of a relationship so recently, put me in a mindset of telling him I was too nervous to come visit him yet. I told him I was so sorry but I just needed a little more time to heal from my past relationship and work things out in my head before we get serious (he was already talking marriage and such at this point). I know it was shitty of me to cancel the same day. I felt horrible about it.

That was the first time I saw him lose his shit. He told me that I was fake, that I never really loved him, that I was just playing him and wanted to get back with my ex and that was why I wouldn't go to see him. He threatened me with dropping out of our education course because he was so hurt and couldn't handle seeing me everyday. I told him I wasn't breaking up with him (we had just started dating a few days prior officially) but just that I needed us to slow things down. He accused me of leading him on, which I kept getting confused about because I wasn't breaking up with him.

So I apologized and said I would come anyway, but I told him again I didn't want to have sex and to please be slow with me because I felt really fragile. He reassured me and stayed on the phone with me the whole drive over. He initiated sex with me and I didn't say no. I didn't say yes (I mean he didn't ask) but I didn't say no, so I don't count it as assault or anything. But my god that hurt my feelings so much. He assured me he'd go slow, but it happened in the first 10 minutes of meeting.

That was my confirmation that he didn't really respect me, even though to this day he tells me all the time he does.

After that his behavior totally changed. No more outpouring of sweet words or actions. He got mad all of the time. He still does. He yells at me about my tone constantly. That I have a bitchy tone, but really it's if I have anything but my very happy tone he gets upset.

The fights were usually in that vein or him telling me I'm cheating because I didn't answer a phone call fast enough (that was really only 3 times though).  I cried all of the time and he told me I was just too emotional and needed to learn that fighting in relationships is healthy if no one is physically hurt. Or if there was no verbal abuse and then would grill me ""You don't think I'm verbally abusing you, right?"" and if I didn't give a resounding no he'd lecture me about how I'm too soft.

I totally lost all of my spark. He started telling me it was time to move in together. Really I let myself be convinced that moving in together would fix all of our problems. He got really sweet when he'd tell me he'd love to cook me breakfast everyday and go on walks. Begin our lives together. I got really scared. I kept saying yes but raising concerns. Saying I wanted to weight until we fought less or we were employed in the field we were studying to be in. He would tell me there wasn't a reason to weight.

I was a total pushover and it wasn't fair of me to give in and say yes when I wanted to say no. It was deceitful of me. Eventually it was a week before we planned to move in together and I broke down and told him I couldn't do it. I wasn't ready, I didn't want to break up, but I couldn't live with him yet. I needed more stability in my life and in our relationship.

He was really upset, which to a degree that's fair, it was such short notice. But, he told me that I was fucking with his life by quitting like this. That I was fake and I never really loved him. That people who loved each other wouldn't act like this. That I was so immature for thinking this was. He told me I had to choose right then to either live together or to break up. I told him I didn't want either of those things and he said before he hung up ""Great, well I'm telling everyone you broke us up"".

He messaged all of our friends that I was a liar and a cheater in a group chat with me in it. He then called like 10 minutes later, we argued for a bit and then he reeled me in telling me it would be fine. Nothing I'm concerned about is going to be an issue. He was so comforting. Promising me things would be so much better when we lived together. That we just fought because we were frustrated being away from each other.

I calmed down and agreed that we would move in together the next week. God sorry this is long. Anyway I broke up with him the day before we were supposed to move in together the second time over text (it's shitty and cowardly, I know. I just couldn't say the words, but that's no excuse) and I blocked him on everything. That's shitty to, I know I know but I knew that if he called me I would cave and get back with him. I was so unhappy.

I started getting dozens of calls from an unknown number. I knew it was him. He texted me several times from that number telling me I was fake and how could I do this to someone I loved. Simple, because I didn't love him (his words). It broke my heart over and over. I blocked that number too and turned off my phone for 5 days.

He made a fake linkedin account and got me there. I caved. I read the message and replied. He told me we needed to have an adult conversation about what happened. That it wasn't right to end like this. I thought I owed him that, an explanation. Long story short we got back together and I apologized for how I ended things. He told me he accepts me and my mental health issues that make me like this (even though they don't I don't think, he just says that a lot).

We've been back together like this since early February of this year. So many more fights about my tone and attitude. I'm always crying. I'm always apologizing. But god I love him. I really poured my whole soul into this man. It kills me that I'll never hear his voice, his laugh, ever again. I'm crying just at the thought. It hurts.

God writing it out makes it seem obvious that we need to break up. But sometimes, he's just so sweet and kind that I think this is really all my fault. That I'm just so broken and insecure that I've really caused all of these issues. But regardless of if it's my fault or not, I need out.

We're supposed to move in together this weekend. See my pattern? Bailing at the last minute. I'm shit, I know trust me. Please give me advice. How can I break it off for real this time. Please give me advice that's beyond just do it. I can't be the only one who gets pulled in so easily. I'm a pushover. I'm anxious. Please help. I'm posting this a few places because of the deadline. Be honest if you want. I have a lot to criticize. I know my flaws.

TL:DR: Uhh I'm a coward who keeps trying to get out of a relationship that I think is toxic and my boyfriend keeps convincing me not to and I keep giving in. (Sorry idk how to make this short)  


  
EDIT: I did it guys. I expected to get ripped apart about my immaturity, but I was met with so much support and advice. Thank you. He's blocked. All of my social media with my name on it is deactivated. My number is changed. It's too soon to know if there is fallout yet, but I'm finally free.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/13758if/i_27f_cant_break_up_with_my_bf_31m_but_i_need_to/,t2_ajtl01emi,2023-05-04 08:59:46,13
"I, (F26) and my now ex Partner (M27) were together for almost 6yrs but then I decided to finally end it this time, hopefully for good, because there‚Äôs no growth in our relationship.","Should I move on na? Or still try to make it work? I (F26), broke up with my boyfriend (27M), last September, but we somehow still remain in contact. We were together for 6 years, he is my first boyfriend. I don't count HS rels/flings (two). I tried to block him for 2 weeks, di ko natiis, kasi parang ang dami ko pang gustong sabihin. How do you move on ba from the only person you've ever loved?

  
Reason for breaking up, a lot. But primarily: Trust and Respect. He doesn't trust me nor respect me. When I say my whereabouts, he will always have a follow up video call, kapag na confirm nya na, ibababa nya na. Wala mang lang kumusta or anything. Kapag magpapaalam ako na I will hangout with my officemates (which I tell him ahead of time), sino mga kasama ko, saan at ano gagawin. Di naman nya ako pinagbabawalan, sinasabi pa nga nya na mag enjoy ako. But sometimes, he will say nasty and disrespectful things. He will say sorry sometimes, say na he didn't mean it that he was just angry, that he loves me so much, he can't lose me. When I say all my heartaches, most of the time, he'll say na, *""matagal na yun"", ""tapos na yan"", ""nag t throwback ka na naman"".* Like the first time I asked him for flowers, way before valentines then it came, *""Oh ayan na flowers mo, masaya ka na?"".*

  
When he left me/walked out on me sa MRT/Trinoma station because I can't decide which Chicken restaurant I wanted to go. I ran after him, but he shove my arms away. And continued to walk away. He didn't even looked back. Wala pa akong car nitong time na to, kaya naka commute lang ako. Gabi na nun, I was wearing a dress, so I went home alone. Which he never did before, kasi lagi nya ako hinahatid, kaya it really pained me. Tas when we talked about it, sabi nya it never happened. Na di nya lang ako narinig, at ang usapan namin half-way kaya umuwi na sya. But whatever daw, he apologize if ganun naging dating sakin. Di naman na daw naulit.

  
One time, this was 2022. I was out with my officemates in a japanese restaurant (1min walk from our office in Makati). He called, so lumabas muna ako so I can hear him properly. He got mad. Na bakit ko sa labas sinagot at hindi sa loob. Na natatakot daw ba ako na makita na lalaki ang katabi ko? And bakit may beer? So of course, in my defense, nakikisama lang ako and it's just San Mig light, a bottle or two. Bakit daw ako umiinom. Sabi ko naman, I see nothing wrong with it, before nga sya pa nagpapatikim sakin ng iba't ibang brand. And kilala naman nya mga kasama ko. It's a dinner lang naman with few drinks. And di naman ako palainom. And we'll finish din by 9pm dahil magsasara na yung restau. Tas he hurled words at me na. Tuwang tuwa ba ako na may iba nagsasabi na maganda ako? Hindi daw ba ako makuntento na sya lang nag sasabi non? Na upon his standards kaya nya ako nagustuhan, at kugn di ako susunod, wala daw sya panghihinayangan sa babaeng umiinom. E, hindi naman talaga ako umiinom. 2022 lang ako natuto uminom ng beer.

  
For the record, he never physically hurt me nor cursed me. But there was this instance na, while I was driving, I can't help but voice out my feelings, frustrations, so much that I stopped the car muna. Oo, mataas tone ko, but I never did cursed him nor insulted him. Di ko lang napigilan mag break down.. And what he did.. he shouted *""AHHHHH!!!""* at my very face. Just to imitate me daw bec that's how I looked and sounded like. And he said sorry after a few minutes.

  
Although, would it still count as abuse? If he R\*ped me? But this was a few years ago pa, in the first year of our relationship (months before our anniv?). Bec he got jealous with someone from work. He threw my phone, grabbed my arms. We were alone in their house then. I was trying to yell, telling him to stop, he covered my mouth while he is restraining my two wrists with the other. I can remember the fear crawling from my feet, and the pain... He apologized and I forgave him. Na I thought and felt that his anger was justified because he was jealous and he loves me so much. Inisip ko, if totoo ba na I'm cheating or having an affair, justified ba lahat nang actions and words nya? For him, for the 6 years, sya lang nagbuhat ng relationship namin, na sya lang nag e effort. But if you will ask me, ganun rin naman naramdaman ko. I stopped asking him and begging him for things para di na ako nasasaktan at na d disappoint. And that's what happened overtime.

  
Hindi ko alam if eto yung sinasabing trauma bond. We keep going back to each other. Di ko sya matiis. Lagi ko syang na m miss. Na kapag sinunod ko lahat ng gusto nya, at susunod lang ako sa kanya, magiging okay na ba ang lahat? I told everything to my friends, and they were both shocked and disappointed. Na bakit ngayon ko lang sinabi, at bat ko hinayaan na ganon. Na I am being manipulated. Dahil alam nya na babalik at babalik ako. Na there is no repairing it na, 6years na namin triny, pero nothing changed. Na wag daw ako magpadala sa sorry, babawi, magbabago na ako blhablh. Tama na daw yung 6 years and just cherish na lang the happy memories. Isipin ko na lang daw yung future na masasayang or if magkaron kami ng kids, ganon ba yung gusto kong maging father figure nila? Na I should stop na my delusion that I can fix him.

  
Of course there are happy memories. Whereas he was so sweet and caring. Our shared jokes, laughter, the comfort I find just lying on his shoulder and chest. Those things. Nasanay na ako na sya kasama ko sa lahat, especially my birthdays, holidays... Unang pasko to at New Year na di kami nag date, at di ko maiwasan malungkot at ma miss lahat. Like every other couple, may masaya naman kaming moments. How I wish na ganun na lang lahat. Sino ba namang babae ang hindi pinangarap na ang First and Only nila e ang the One na rin--forever. I can't help but still think na we can still start fresh, anew.

  
SIguro need ko lang ilabas. Gusto ko na rin ng bagong taon, bagong buhay. Ngayon ,naiisip ko pa rin i chat sya. Masyadong mahaba na. Siguro I will answer na lang questions if may magtatanong.Mahal na mahal ko pa rin sya, pero ayaw ko na magulo at malito pa ang isip at damdamin ko. Gusto ko na lang mag focus sa business, sa career, magpakabusy para hindi ko na sya maisip.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/18x5j6v/i_f26_and_my_now_ex_partner_m27_were_together_for/,t2_pp2lxeuqy,2024-01-03 08:38:54,18
My(37M) partner(36F) of 15 years has completely worn me down... I'm at my breaking point... and TBH I'm terrified.,"This is my(37M) first ever reddit post... and on a throwaway account no less. TBH I didn't realize Reddit was used like this till a few Reddit Tik Tok accounts started making content posts several months ago, and between those videos and reading Reddit posts, I decided to seek some help. It will be pretty long so I'll give a summary before I bare my soul, anonymously to you all. Seeking advice, I don't know if I want to support. I have noticed that several posts I've read have mentioned this can be sort of therapeutic. So here goes. 

TL;DR I(37M) have been with my partner(36F) for 15 years. In that time we've gone through quite a bit with our relationship. Between her anxiety, an absolute fear of change, and what I hope is subconsciously sabotaging, I have reached the end of my ropes. I don't want to leave her, I have been open with this with her in terms of explaining how I feel, I've explained multiple times that what she is doing is destroying me, to no avail. Add in that there's been no sexual intimacy between us for over 7 years now... none at all. 
It hasn't all been bad, she at times has been the very thing keeping me together. Shes taken care of me when I was sick, badly injured... First time I cried in front of anyone was her. I truly do love her. Most of the time it's ok, it use to great most of the time, then good.... now we're at ok. But at best at the moment she's a roommate who I don't sleep with, don't have sex with, doesn't pay half of the bills.


Now for the full story, there are about 15 years to unpack here, I apologize in advance as this will be a rather long post, parts of which are going to be hard to read through. I'm going to include a short brief of both myself and my partner first to help keep this long post as short as possible.

- Myself:  I'm a large and tall guy, can be intimidating as I don't smile too often unless I'm with friends, despite the intimidation factor, despite that and being anti-social, I developed the ability to be a great listener, for some reason people like to come to me to vent, still to this day, although only very few can as I've pretty much just withdrawn myself from society, that will be explained in the post. I have also suffered through insomnia most of my life, which does get worse with stress. I think I also suffer from depression, at least of late. 
I am a hard worker, I love to work as it is my only real outlet mentally. You put in a hard day's work, and the negative thoughts aren't so loud. I am not religious, sort of spiritual if that makes any sense, primarily I hate conformity. I do have an extensive history of anger management problems dating back to childhood, years of anger management during my adolescent and teenage years, coupled with football, menial labor, and self-reflection, I had a really good hold on it, however over the last couple of years as I keep taking hits mentally, those holds aren't tight anymore... honestly I feel more like a ticking time bomb now than I ever have... that's the terrifying part. 
Lastly, I believe in mutual respect in any relationship whether it be with a friend or with my partner. Mutual respect includes trust, privacy, cooperation, and understanding.

- My partner: While on the shorter side, She's the life of the party. Loves to go to parties, loves to be out and about, and loves her family and friends. She's essentially the, ""If walls would talk, she'd talk to them"" type of person. Loves her pets, and if she can figure out and take care of her anxiety and fear of change, she would/will be a great mother. That last part is key as she's based her entire being on being a mother. On our third date, we had a rather frank conversation about what we wanted and did not want in our relationship. We went over fidelity, goals, wants, etc... and one thing she made clear was that she wanted children, and while I explained that I didn't want children, if this worked, I'd do what I could to make that happen. It's harder on her side. Over the years we have both put on weight, but I don't find her any less attractive. Unfortunately, that weight hasn't helped her in that department, but it's pretty much mute as we've not had any physical intimacy in a long time.
The negatives are forthcoming, and at times crippling fear of change coupled with uncontrolled anxiety that she will not seek help from a therapist, she does have medication, which she refuses to keep up with. I have spent countless hours researching ways for me to help her with it, and have spent too much money, to no avail. Lastly, there's what can only be described as laziness, which I've only now realized is laziness putting this together. 
Alright, now from the beginning. 

When we first started dating, I had roommates, despite having roommates, within the first few weeks she was spending more nights with me than her parents. Gradually moving more and more stuff over in terms of clothing and personal items. I didn't mind as I loved her being around. Call that the honeymoon phase. We went out, had adventures, decent amount of sex, etc... life was good mostly. The problem came up with her trust and respecting my stance on mutual respect. In a relationship, mutual respect to me goes as follows.
- Respect: Both public and private, talk and treat me with the same respect you expect yourself. Keep any and all hostility out of the public eye. Allow me to be a man and you a woman. If I need to protect you, I will, you can't fight against that, with there being absolutely no need to publicly berate, talk down,  or shame the other party in public. Both parts she has abused multiple times...
- Trust: If we say something, believe that it's true unless proving otherwise. No snooping, eavesdropping, 
- Privacy: What happens in our relationship and our lives together is between us. I don't talk about my private life to anyone, I don't hide her, she's on all my social media, my friends and close family knew her, met her. I just don't talk about our relationship and I expect the same in return. Instead, her immediate family knows everything about our relationship... everything, well anything that doesn't make her look bad.
- Cooperation: We're in this relationship together, we need to work together to make it work. That is physically, financially, emotionally, and mentally. If one person is doing it all, often with the partner going against it, it creates an untenable situation as I've now learned. 
- Understanding: understanding is straightforward, if one is doing something that the other doesn't like, communicate, understand where they're coming from and change what you can. Keep communication up so that you work on your shortcomings. 

Despite all of this,  I was madly in love with her, I still love her, which is why it hurts as much as it does I think... I proposed to her after a year. We initially tried planning a wedding, I even agreed to a church wedding if she wanted. She couldn't make up her mind and shot down any suggestions. To me, she's my wife, too the government we're partners. Eventually, she gave up on that, I still make suggestions, and try to give her ideas so she can have her ceremony, again to no avail.
These are all things I discussed with her when we had the baby talk. These are all things that she's both consciously and I think subconsciously gone against in one form or another. 
I'm not sure when it started, but after a few months, I noticed signs of her snooping. While we each knew each other's passwords, it was expected, at least from me, that that didn't give you the right to snoop. It goes against trusting your partner. I'd notice the ""last logged in"" time in my email would be different, something I noticed after noticing my phone in places I didn't leave it. I'd confront her and she'd deny it. I'd let it go, but a couple of days later it's happening again. At the time I worked 3 jobs, a full-time menial labor job, a bouncer/doorman for a couple of night clubs, and my side job which eventually became my full-time business. Throughout the night she'd drive by,  checking up on me, she even did it with her mother once. At first, it was cute, then when she'd deny it despite seeing her, it got annoying. She'd always give herself away when she ask me about the women who I walked to their cars on particular nights... the woman being the bottle girls and bartenders, and when they'd have a rough night or feel threatened, we'd(security) make sure they'd get to their vehicles safely. Being the doorman, while being assertive, you still have to be somewhat hospitable and friendly. Couple that with lonely women, and you will get napkins with numbers on them from heavily intoxicated women... and in a couple of instances, men. You take the number, be friendly, and send them on their way disposing of when able out of their sight. Something you don't always remember to do on busy nights. Naturally, snooping finds those very notes. And while going through both my phone and email, still found it necessary to confront me. Which would result in a fight. It got so bad with the snooping and denial that I got tired of it, I warned her that if it didn't end, I'd leave her. But she kept doing it, so I had a very close friend send me illicit messages from his girlfriend's phone which wasn't saved in my contacts. She confronted me, and I gave her the proof of the setup, packed her shit up, and broke up with her. That lasted about a week. We talked, and got together and it did get better, for a time. She doesn't snoop anymore, or she got so good at it that I haven't been able to catch her. 
Over time I found out that she was telling her mom and sister about our relationship, I think sexual info as well. Her father can't keep a secret. 
See I do love sex, I love to give orally and get orally just two problems, I don't cum quickly, and I'm not that big, not small either, big enough to offer pleasure, small enough for it to affect me subconsciously. With that in mind, I made it a priority to be able to bring a woman to climax orally in case I couldn't do so with penetration. As a result of that, I ended up loving that part and getting it. Any woman before my partner, when you made sure they were taken care of, there's a certain amount of enthusiasm you get in return both orally and then sexually. If I got them off, especially first and often again, they would make sure I would get off. This wasn't the case with my partner. I'd make sure she'd get off, often multiple times, and while at first, she would try, she'd give up quickly. To the point of having to take care of myself by myself. I'd get excuses that I took too long, too eventually that sex hurt for her, mind you again I'm not that big, and I'm not ignorant to mood or lubrication. But she would never turn away getting oral. As time went on, as I got more and more no's and more and more excuses, I guess I just stopped asking... I also stopped giving. We haven't had sex since at least 2016... haven't been intimate at all sexually since 2019. Please don't think I haven't tried to change the situation. I've tried exploring with toys to no avail, talking about it which falls on deaf ears, too talking about an open relationship which she categorically turns down and refuses. Yet her family knows my size and how I feel about it, as well as my inability to ""cum fast""... sex is a huge part of a relationship... having a partner who doesn't view you the same way you view her sexually has broken me a few times...

But if she doesn't like to have sex, what about her desire to be a mother? When we tried having a baby the first couple of years, sex wasn't that bad and after a few attempts, she went to a doctor. We tried the medication, vacation, to invetro... single handily the most embarrassing situation I've ever been in was in that room... but it was for her and what she wanted and I did everything I could... till she gave that up too. During that whole time, her sister got married and while having the same hardships getting pregnant, is now pregnant and giving birth soon. 

The last part and possibly longest part is her inability to deal with her anxiety and fear of change. And believe me, in this instance they're not the same thing. While her fear of change can trigger her anxiety, her anxiety is caused by something else. Over the years as it's gotten worse, I've spent so many hours getting to help her. From researching about it, to how to help her when she has attacked, to items that can help her cope. From weighted blankets to edibles, and everything in between. She refuses every attempt at help.  She refuses to talk to a professional and refuses to take the medication prescribed by her doctor. The fear of change is so bad that you can't even plan for the future. After years at my menial labor job, I wanted to take my business and go full-time with it. While planning it, and getting arrangements in place, she and her mother would try and sabotage it. Mainly mentally. How can you say you support someone or believe in them, to turn around and say that what they want to do won't work, it's not worth the risk. This would result in fights,  which got so bad that I had to give her the ultimatum, get on board or leave. She chose to stay, and while she didn't talk against it, she also didn't help with getting it set up. When I finally made the change it was another fight.  Which hasn't stopped. When it's bad, and there's been a lot of bad times, especially during covid, and whenever I toss ideas at her for her opinion, it's a negative. Again this is something I talk to her about, and it never changes. I started my business almost 10 years ago, and it's still open. When it comes to what is next or what I want to do, I can't go into too much detail as it may cement an ID of who I am to anyone who is reading this and know me. Let's just say I long for a life of self-prosperity for both myself and my friends free of societal dependency. Something that requires a lot of planning... something that is also heavily fought back against. While I get the ""that's a good idea"", there's no dialogue. There's no give when any sacrifice is proposed. This goal requires a couple of years of discipline and sacrifice to achieve, one that she refused till she had no choice. Just after COVID, the apartment we had rented for almost 10 years was sold to a new owner who wanted to move in. The move I had been trying to do since 2019 was to give up the apartment and move into my business location for 1 to 2 years, and with the money we save, we can pay cash for the next part and not rely on a loan, another thing that was fought against. My business location is located in an industrial building of trades mixed with a doctor's office and a gym. My unit itself takes up well over 2k sqft,  with a bathroom,  shower, and small ""kitchen"", of which not even half the space is being used by my business. While it's not in my lease that you can't do what I wanted, it's also not something I believe they would approve of. Well when the apartment building sold, it was the perfect solution. Why spend all that money on high rent, first last deposit when we can move and consolidate? Even with eviction, she still fought me. To the point, I took my stuff, or everything but her clothes to the shop and said she could go to her parents, only after this did she finally get on board. Set up our living arrangements in a part of my unit that doesn't have anyone near it most of the time. You can't see into my unit, but there's a part of my unit that is wedged between the offices of a trades business on one side and the offices of a gym on the other. Loud sounds make their way through the walls in those parts rather easily. In that part, I have had a few recliners set up for the last few years comfortable recliners. As I don't think the owners would approve, no one knows we moved into my unit. However, my partner snores very loud, and so do I, however, with my sleep mask I don't. She doesn't wear one so her snoring is full blast. This is why I set up the living arrangements where I did.  However, she likes to fall asleep on one of those recliners, which wouldn't be an issue if she slept at night. But she purposely stays awake till 4 am most nights and sleeps well into the afternoon. I keep making her aware of this, to the point that I've had a couple of meltdowns over the last year. She knows that I know it's being done intentionally, after each fight she doesn't do it for a day or two and then goes right back to doing it. She was laid off about 2 months ago, and her behavior of staying up all night didn't help. The money that was saved up is rapidly dwindling. She isn't looking for work and isn't trying to change her behavior, and now without a job she sleeps all day, and stays up all night. If we're caught here and evicted, I lose my business. I lose my business I don't know what I'll do.  Now it's affecting me, to the point it's hard to get out of bed every day. Depression has been hitting me harder and harder as I see no way out. I'm constantly angry, I'm always on edge, and she doesn't care. Not that I ever expected or asked for, now that I think of it,  there's never been an ""I'm proud of you"", ""good job"", or thank you for what you do for us from her, instead I get what feels like constant negativity and doubt.80+ hour weeks to support us between multiple jobs when she barely worked, to trying to set up our future... I want(ed) to spend the rest of my life with this woman, but as I've been writing this all out and reflecting, I don't think she's ever loved or respected me... as I keep hitting walls and I fall deeper, the negative thoughts get louder. They've always been there, but these last few months they're so loud... some days they're deafening. I don't know what to say... I guess I don't need advice, rereading this the answer is obvious... but it's not easy. I don't think I can, but I'm afraid of what happens to me if I don't...

If you're still with me here, thank you for reading. I've tried to make sure all of the Grammer is right. I don't know how to end this... let me know your thoughts.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/10hvb1t/my37m_partner36f_of_15_years_has_completely_worn/,t2_vn7rghn6,2023-01-22 00:38:33,6
