I‚Äôm always sexualized and I‚Äôm sick of it. ,"Hi, everyone! Not here to seek for pity or whatever, I‚Äôm just sick and tired of being sexualized. 

I (F21) always feel objectified, no matter who I‚Äôm talking to. For context, I have huge breasts. I‚Äôm a cup DD, bordering cup E, I guess? People say I‚Äôm curvy, too. Though di ako sure about that because my body dysmorphia‚Äôs crazy hahaha. Dahil dito, yung una talagang nakikita ng mga tao ay yung breasts ko. Like literally. People always think na super active ng sex life ko. Lagi nilang iniisip na my body count‚Äôs over 10 na, and if I tell them na it‚Äôs only a single digit, and less than 5 pa, ang OA ng pagka-shock nila kasi it‚Äôs something they never expected daw. I‚Äôve received these kinds of statements all the damn time na and I‚Äôm so sick of it. Hindi ko alam why I always get hurt whenever people tell me this. I‚Äôm not saying its offensive because I do like being freaky and it‚Äôs not like I don‚Äôt engage rin sa hook up culture. It‚Äôs just that‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm always being looked down upon? The guys I like only like me for my body. Recently, I was talking to this guy who flirted with me, and he seemed like a good guy. Like hindi fuckboy vibes? So I was hoping na baka this time around, I‚Äôd meet a guy that had pure intentions. Pero wala pang 3 days ng paguusap, inaya agad ako to fuck? And he consistently dropped innuendos, too. I didn‚Äôt go for it kasi walang wala talaga ako sa mood nun to sleep around. Tapos today, I found out na he‚Äôs dating someone, and it was just days ago na inaya niya ako ulit to sleep with him. It just made me wonder lang if pang kantot lang ba talaga ako ü•π kasi I genuinely liked the guy but I didn‚Äôt wanna fuck around muna. But I guess yun lang habol niya? This isn‚Äôt the first time na nangyari sakin to. Hahahaha

Kahit mga babae kong tropa, lagi lang nila pino-point na ang laki ng dede ko, ganto, ganyan. Na ang swerte daw ng mga makaka-ano ko. And if we talk about my insecurities and I‚Äôd say na sometimes, I don‚Äôt feel pretty, they‚Äôd say ‚Äúmalaki naman dede mo‚Äù and idk why it‚Äôd feel iffy for me üò≠ (edit: i‚Äôve opened up abt this a hundred of times na and they‚Äôre well aware na ganito nararamdaman ko but idk why they‚Äôd still bring up similar comments haha)

Kahit hindi naman slutty yung panunuot ko, magmumukha pa rin daw slutty, like people would say hahaha. 

Wala lang, I‚Äôm just sick and tired of feeling like this. And I don‚Äôt even know if I‚Äôm making sense atp. Or if valid nararamdaman ko. 

Thought process lang on why I‚Äôm ranting: bwhahaha last straw ko na talaga yung guy na I thought had pure intentions sakin, tas I‚Äôd find out na he‚Äôs dating someone.. ewan ko?? Ang sampal sakin?? Even though aware na ako sa gantong image ng mga tao sakin, parang nasampal pa rin ako hahahaha na parang nanliliit ako

Edit: i had a conversation about this with a very close guy friend (a friend since 2016) and told me verbatim ‚Äúif we aren‚Äôt as close as we are, i‚Äôd invite you to fuck rin tbh‚Äù hahaha take note, he‚Äôs the best friend of my ex üòî so yes, this has been my problem for so long na

"Irresponsible friend is HIV+, sexually active, not using protection","A little background on this friend/coworker (25M). He is very irresponsible, to both his work and personal life. Pero iniintindi namin siya, kaibigan padin namin siya kaya niya din naopen up samin na HIV+ siya, 6 months ago lang. Gusto lang din namin na maging OK siya. 

Unfortunately, wala pa atang 3 months after niyang malaman na positive siya ay bumalik agad siya sa pakikipagmeetup sa random strangers na nahahanap niya online. Since di siya nakikinig na wag na muna sana siyang makipagsex habang di pa siya undetectable, we just advise him na wag magmiss sa gamot niya and always use protection. We said this cause we also know na he prefers sex without protection kasi mas nafifeel niya daw (bottom siya btw). 

Ang problem namin ngayon ay nagkwento siya one time and nahuli namin (through his story) na nakipagsex siya without using condoms. Hindi siya umaamin, pero di niya rin maitanggi. So we asked him kung dinidisclose niya ba na positive siya bago siya makipagsex and his answer is (nonverbatim) ""Kailangan ko bang sabihin sakanila? E naging positive nga ako kasi hindi din sinabi sa akin"" Like, ano? So since hinawaan ka, ok lang din na makahawa ka? To think na nagkaTB pa siya and sobrang daming sakit dahil positive na pala siya that time. Nilecturan namin siya about his obligation na idisclose yon lalo na kung ipapatanggal niya ang condom ng partner niya. But as always, dumaan lang na naman yun sa tenga niya. 

Hindi na siya nagkwekwento sa amin ngayon pero kilala namin siya at alam naming nakikipagmeetup padin siya. We as his friends, feel the obligation na iparealize sakanya na he needs to stop what he is doing, na sana maging responsable naman siya lalo na pagdating dito kasi kalusugan niya at ng ibang tao ang nakasalalay. But what can we do? In the end, it is his life to live. We may be stepping off our boundary by telling him what to do. Kaso di namin matanggap how he could be so apathetic and carefree about this serious matter. We remind him whenever the topic comes up. But who knows if he even is practicing safe sex. We just wish we are wrong and he knows better than to be so damn selfish. 

So people, especially those living in Manila, Makati and nearby cities, always practice safe sex when meeting someone. You never know.

P.S. He is not diagnosed, but we are suspecting na nasa autism spectrum siya. It is apparent to us that his mental capacity is not commensurate to his age (this was way before pa siya maging HIV+) Even yung thinking capacity niya kasi ay hindi talaga match sa age niya.  Madalas siyang mawala sa usapan, parang lumulutang ang isip niya madalas kaya ang bilis niyang makalimutan ang work niya. Nagdeday dream din siya. (This is why di siya nakakabuild ng other circle of friends cause people tend to make fun of him) This is the reason why we keep on trying to understand him and we don't cut him off. It's like he has the mind of a child. 

P. P. S I think someone reported this reddit account cause all my comments are being auto-deleted. So I can't reply to all your comments. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/17is742/irresponsible_friend_is_hiv_sexually_active_not/,t2_mqy9ra7nu,1698542739.0,281
My Sexual Abuser is coming home,"I'm a male and my abuser is a woman. She's my father's cousin. Nangyari ito nung bata pa ako and siya lagi ang bantay ko that time. Lately in my life, I have flashbacks of what happened at the time and bumabalik kaunti sa memory ko kong pano nya ako hinalay. 

As a dude, I consider myself lucky... kasi, diba, imagine maganda siya eh. Artistahin na mukha cousin ni erpats. Pero at the same time, parang na realize ko rin na what happened is very wrong. She's a pedo. Teenager siya that time, and I'm just at the age of 5-7 years old.

So, bali ang nangyari ay nandito siya ulit, bumalik ng Pinas for vacation. And sa dami dami ng pwede nya ichat, ako ang chinat nya if makakapunta ba daw ako sa dinner this 25 (it's a family gathering dinner).

Now, remembering all the things that happened, I feel nauseous and dirty at the same time. Pero siempre I replied naman sa kanya na oo andun ako sa araw na yun. Di ko alam if alam nya or dapat ko ba i-brought up sakanya yung nakaraan. I also have this fantasies na gusto ko sana may mangyari saming dalawa, and this time around, I want to be the one yung magkaroon ng control if sakali man. 

I feel so small and vulnerable ngayon. Parang feel ko di ako lalaki. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1ax7etx/my_sexual_abuser_is_coming_home/,t2_87nszhwg,1708611348.0,95
Sexually Frustrated,"I am extremely sexually frustrated with my boyfriend (A couple of months younger than me) weve been together for almost a year. We both had very high sex drive but idk what happened to him.

Im always the one initiating and he enjoys when I give him head. I genuinely enjoy giving head and he does too but he never reciprocates and when we do have sex he doesnt come or he comes too early like a couple seconds.

What I hate is ayaw niya nag sasarili ako. Like he doesn't want to pleasure me but wont let me do it to myself. Like wtf do I even do? Nag papaalam and transparent ako na mag sasarili ako pero ayaw niya. Gusto ko maging transparent tsaka di naman ako tumitingin sa ibang guys, sa previous videos lang namin or whatever pero ayaw niya. Ang hirap pag sexually frustrated. Its been like this for months.

We live together, we have good sleep, we workout together. I don think he's cheating since were always together. Im very good looking, have big tits and can be a 8, 9 or 10 depending on preference. So tell me anong kulang sakin?

For context and to give him credit we have a very healthy relationship, we are both very high earners 6 digits above monthly, we regularly go on dates, were both into video games, he treats me well. Sobrang ayos ng relationship namin. It's just the sex, what once was fiery embers feels like dying ashy coal.

I communicated my needs na previously this has been going for a few months and I even tried asking things he likes in bed and kinks he might have so I can fulfill them for him but he says he has none or doesn't know. I'm not sure what to do :(

Edit: A lot of people are telling me to cheat, that just doesnt sit right with my values. Ive been cheated on so I feel strongly against it. I feel like I want to communicate some more and if it doesnt work out then Ill see where I can go from there. Hopefully it does. Also to people DM'ing me to dox myself. Unfortunately I cannot since I have quite a large following on social media. This is my throwaway. Thank you for all the encouraging dms, ideas, some I already tried some I havent but I appreciate everyone! Ill keep reading your updates and thoughts here all are welcome",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/13titzn/sexually_frustrated/,t2_qp323qf2,1685223173.0,124
Massage Therapist Sexually Assaulted Me,"I got sexually assaulted by a massage therapist last year. 

I went to two doctors who told me that I don't have herpes/syphilis.

I took two tests 6 and 8 weeks. After getting negative, ang pagiging chill ko nag-lalast lang ng two days kasi babalik ako sa pag search about herpes and then magiging hyper aware nanaman ako sa genital area ko. Okay na sana ako, kaso 

Okay na sana ako, kaso kaka search ko sa reddit, some people need pa daw ng 12 weeks before maging positive. Kaya ayon, insomnia na ulit. 

I can't concentrate sa work and grad school dahil dito. Sira na sleep pattern ko. Wala na akong tulog. 

Kahit anong skin condition paranoid na ako. Pimple sa chest, pwet, inner legs.

I think I'm going to go to a psychiatrist na. 

Background info:

=====================================================================================

How do I (M27) tell my GF (F26) that I have been molested by a therapist last year? Slowly losing my mind and I can‚Äôt function.  
  
Me and my GF are going on 6 years this year.  
  
Last year I was not able to go home right away since I forgot to take my keys. My dad was in some fraternity (Mason) and he‚Äôll be late, I decided that in order to kill time, I‚Äôll try out the new massage parlor near our subdivision.  
  
The therapist that was assigned to me was a dude and he proceeded to massage me. Near the end of the massage, he slid his hands from underneath my boxers up until my penis tip and he kinda squeezed my dick. And offered if extra ba daw.  
  
Immediately, napabangon ako tapos sabi ko di ako gumaganyan. I told him na tayo na ako. For someone na puro ‚Äúpag ako niyan susuntokin ko yan‚Äù, natakot ako, dalawa kasi sila lalake na therapist don and mejo malaki katawan baka pagtulongan ako. Kaya tumayo na ako and umalis. Di ko na sinabi sa GF ko baka ako ang ma blame, also I think she had dengue this time kaya di ko nasabi. I don‚Äôt want to risk losing her. Baka di din maniwala. I was pissed but not worried for some reason.  
  
Then come this year, after jogging with my GF (A week ago), I went home and took a shower, napansin ko may bumps sa groin ko, I immediately scratched some of them.  
  
Tapos a few days dun ko na connect ang event, na baka may sakit yung guy and napasahan ako. Dumami na mga mukhang pimple. Search ako ng search sa net and nalaman ko na pwede pala maka transmit ng STD gamit ang kamay.  
  
Habang nasa office ako, I went out to go to a dermatologist, basically dismissive ang derma sa akin kasi low risk daw exposure ko and basically just told me to use a mild soap and nasa utak ko lang.  
  
The next saturday pumunta ako ng ibang derma and I lied by ommision, I told her I had a massage bahala na siya ang mag isip ano nangyari. Sabi niya di naman daw mukhang STD. To be fair, it doesn‚Äôt look like the ones I see on the internet. Mga spots lang na pimple na nag pe peel off pag lagay ko ng cream. And low risk daw ang kamay. She prescribed me a different med.  
  
Ngayon halos nawawala na, kaso focused masyado sensations ko sa genitals ko, konteng kati or anything napaparanoid na ako, search na agad ng symptoms, basa ng mga experience ng ibang tao. Tapos di na makatulog. Nakatulog lang ako yung na distract ako sa tiktok ng vids regarding my hobbies.  
  
I desperately want to tell my GF kasi need ko na takaga ng karamay kaso baka ako ma blame and iwanan ako. I also don‚Äôt want to stress her out kasi may event din sa work niya na siya ang in charged.  
  
I also tried joining the herpes conmunity fb group for the philippines kaso di ako inaccept ng admin, I showed him the rash/pimple and sabi niya di daw herpes iyon and dismissed me agad and told me to trust my derma kasi alam nila ano herpes and ano ang di herpes.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1ax7t1p/massage_therapist_sexually_assaulted_me/,t2_vuog7wka,1708612385.0,0
I got sexually harassed. I stood up for myself.,"It all happened when I was commuting going to school, early in the morning, kay aga aga may masamang nangyari sakin, 

Nakaarrive ako sa terminal na pinagsasakayan ko - bus, dahil malapit na mapuno ang bus, ang kulang nalang ay lima (5), isa ako sa limang kulang. Dahil nga may kulang nalang, nasa dulong bahagi na ako nakaupo ng bus, supposedly limang tao lang dapat ang nakaupo, pero 6 kami (may nakaupo na isa katabi ang bintana bago nagsabi ng may kulang pa na pasahero), ako ay nasa pagitan ng dalawang lalaki, 2nd to the last ako sa bintana which is on my right side, at sa left side ko naman ay yung gago, so siksikan. 

Habang nasa gitna ng daan, may kung ano mang akong nararamdaman sa dibdib ko, kaliwang(left) bahagi ng dibdib ko, nung una akala ko ay ang aking ID, dahil yakap ko sa aking harapan ay ang aking bag at pagitan nun ay ang ID ko, pinabayaan ko muna, pero dahil hindi nananahimik ang utak ko dahil iba na talaga ang nararamdaman ko sa dibdib ko, parang bang bulate't sinusundot ang kaliwang bahagi ng dibdib ko, 

Doon na ako natakot, nanginig, at malapit nang umiyak dahil sa pangyayayaring iyon, yung gagong katabi ko sa kaliwa ay daliri nya ang sumusundot sa kaliwang bahagi ng dibdib, hindi sa gilid ng dibdib kundi MALAPIT SA GITNA ng dibdib, dahil sinilip ko ng kaonti ang pagitan ng dibdib ko at bag, at doon ko natagpuan na hindi siko, DALIRI NYA, dalawang daliri (left hand, Index and middle finger), kumabaga ang posisyon ng arms nya ay naka crossarm sya, under ang left arm/hand, so patago nya na paulit ulit sinusundot ang dibdib ko, hindi ko na nabilang kung ilang beses nya ginawa dahil natakot ako, hindi ko alam ang aking gagawin, ang daming pumapasok sa isip ko, gusto ko lang naman makarating sa school, nakaranas pa ako ng ganon. 

Pero hindi tama iyon, harassment, crime na sya, hindi ako aalis at pupunta sa school na para bang walang nangyari, hindi ganon, hindi pwede, hindi pwede makakalayas sya nang ganon kadali dahil sa ginagawa nya, hindi, hindi ako pumayag. 

Sumigaw ako, umiiyak, sabay kuha ng kadiring dalawang daliri nung gago na nakapwesto nga sa kaliwang bahagi ng dibdib ko. Nagalit ako, nagmura, wala na akong pake kung sino man nakarinig, pero one thing for sure, rinig lahat ng mga pasahero, rinig hangang sa driver ng bus ang sigaw ko. 

Lumapit yung konduktor, ipinalipat ng bagong pwuesto yung gago, malayo sa akin, at sinabi sakin (yung konduktor) na mag reklamo ako, sumangayon rin yung ibang pasahero doon sa row ko. At doon ko na tinuloy ang reklamo ko, at buti nalang hindi sya pwedeng makababa, nagalit yung driver at hindi sya papayagan makababa yung gago. 

Hangang sa may nadaanan kaming mga pulis at doon kaming parehas ibinaba at doon ko itinuloy ang reklamo ko. 

At alam nyo pa kung ano ang mas nakakagago? 

Habang nilagay ko ang narrative ko, and personal info, nilagay ko rin yung kay gago since sya ang suspect, and ano ang nakita ko? 

Barangay Tanod sya, yung gagong iyon ay isang barangay tanod. 

Na hindi man nya alam ang Anti-Bastos law? Puta sya. Ang kapal ng mukha nya.




Please sa mga kababaihan, sa mga tao, wag kayong matakot na magreklamo, ipagtanggol nyo ang iyong karapatan, protektahan nyo ang sarili nyo, ni hindi ko alam kung bakit tayo pa ang gagawa ng mga paraan para lang maging safe tayo sa mga ganitong mga pangyayari kung pwede nalang silang maglaho, yung mga gantong klaseng tao.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/16uc1pq/i_got_sexually_harassed_i_stood_up_for_myself/,t2_jjw4azjc,1695896050.0,455
Nakakatakot ma-accuse ng sexual abuse wrongly,"I was accused of forcing someone to sleep with me and para magsend ng bare naked pictures.  At first, I was like ‚Äúeh, I know na I didn‚Äôt and that‚Äôs enough‚Äù, pero little did I know, it wasn‚Äôt as near as what I thought it would be. 

Let‚Äôs be real, it‚Äôs undeniably and unfortunately, since it came from a woman‚Äôs mouth, everyone believed her na she was SA‚Äôd by me. At an instant, I lost my friends, my well-respected image, and most importantly, my identity. 

It‚Äôs tough to live with what I‚Äôm feeling. The constant fear of bumping into someone who thinks na I‚Äôm a bad person. The fear of loving or trusting someone again as I might be betrayed again. 

It has been months that I can‚Äôt sleep properly and the inability to appreciate myself. In fact, I feel like dying whenever my hormones act up. The guilt and conscience of being horny even though I didn‚Äôt do anything bad at all kills me slowly. 

Minsan, napapaisip ako na no one deserves this. The consequences I had to go through over a lie is unimaginable.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/19em0m0/nakakatakot_maaccuse_ng_sexual_abuse_wrongly/,t2_dz0euv4z,1706116072.0,326

I was sexually assaulted by my tito,"Hello. Posting this here since wala akong mapagsabihan sa family and friends ko and parang sasabog na yung utak ko kakaisip. 

This happened years ago na, I'm already 21 yrs old (F). 

When I was young, I used to stay a lot at my tita's house (kapatid ni mama). Same street lang yung bahay namin and bahay nila.  Lagi ako nandoon kasi gusto ko nakikipaglaro sa mga bata sa labas and kalaro ko din yung anak ng pinsan ko. Sa bahay kasi namin laging sarado kaya nasa loob ka lang talaga. 

So ayon, I was there almost everyday, and then yung tito ko would always touch me inappropriately. Hindi ko magawang wag magpunta kasi as a kid, gusto kong makalaro yung ibang mga bata. He would always touch my private parts whenever he gets the chance. May mga times, magkakasalubong kami and then bigla niya akong hahawakan sa dibdib ko or sa vagina ko talaga. I also remember a time when he kissed me on the lips, pinasok niya din talaga yung dila niya sa bibig ko. I think nasa mga grade 3 to grade 5 ako nung mga panahon na yon? 

For the past years, pilit kinakalimutan yan ng utak ko, trauma response siguro? Alam niyo yung alam mong nangyari siya sayo pero sa utak mo ang thought na lumalabas is ""sigurado ka bang ganyan yung nangyari? Baka naman gawa gawa mo lang yan?""? And then a few months ago, he died. Nung nalaman ko na namatay na siya, wala akong naramdaman na kahit ano, and  sobrang emotional akong tao, mabilis ako maiyak especially when a family member dies. 

But that time, ang response ko lang talaga when they told me he died was ""ahhh"", and then tinuloy ko na panonood ko sa tv. As in yan lang, walang luha or anything. Tatlong araw ata siya nakalamay non. Isang beses lang ako pumunta and never akong sumilip sa kabaong niya. Nakita ko lang yung katawan niya nung iccremate na siya, dun sa may glass kung saan nakasilip yung family before siya icremate. 

When I saw him lying there, I was somewhat relieved. Ilang taon yung lumipas walang nakaalam nung mga ginagawa niya na yon nung bata ako. Until now, di ko pa rin kayang sabihin sa family ko.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/181iwhp/i_was_sexually_assaulted_by_my_tito/,t2_i9uylvqcr,1700685101.0,133
Akala ko magiging sexually active ako after breakup,"Tangina, di pala. HAHAHAHAHAHA. I used to envision myself as a guy who goes around drinking and partying and filling other people's holes to fill the void in his heart, pero hindi pala. Hindi ko kaya. Hanggang pakikinig lang kay The Weeknd ang aabutin ng ka-fuckboyan ko. HAHAHAHAHAHA.

I don't shame promiscuous people/judge hookup culture (unless mga nanloloko kayo zzzz), but I find myself feeling guilt just imagining getting into bed w/someone that I'm not romantically interested in. May nireto sakin who was DTF, but after a couple days, I backed out. Hindi ko kaya eh.

Bullied and Sexually harassed,"Since I was in elementary, nabubully na ako because I'm fat. Fat, fat, fat. I used not to care until high school. I always feel like there's something wrong with my body, I liked my body but their words made me hate it. Until my father say something bad na rin about my body, kesyo ang taba ko na, kahit pati sa pagkain pinipigilan ako kahit unang subo ko palang, that's when I started being so sensitive, na da down ako palagi when they say something about my body, ang dali dali ko na ma offend. I don't go out often. Nagkukulong na ako sa kwarto. My college days were just the same, new people, new bullies. And stress eating na rin. I hated my body even more, it ruined my mental health, I started thinking of suicide. Madalas, madalas ang suicidal thoughts. Kahit na may mga taong tumitingin sakin feeling ko na jina judge nila ako. May one time na sobrang na bully at napahiya ako, walang gabi na hindi ako umiiyak, pag nasa kalsada ako iniisip ko na magpapasagasa nalang ako. I was a mess, palagi nalang masikip dibdib ko. 

Year 2022 I had my first job and the worst. I don't want to mention names of the company. 3 lang kami babae (including the supervisor) sa workplace and the rest lalaki na. Halos lahat pamilyado, may mga anak na babae pero hindi marunong rumespeto. They verbally harassed me, na ang sarap ko daw makas3x, hindi ko madefend sarili ko dahil puro sila lalaki, nagtatawanan pa after masabi yon, umiyak ako pauwi sobra. Yung isa kong ka workmate na babae, minanyak nung guard, kung saan siya nakaupo, inaamoy niya yung upuan. Nalaman namin yon dahil may nagsumbong. A week after, may isang nagsabi sakin na ginagawa din daw sakin yon nung guard, pero nanahimik lang sila. Parang ang unfair sa part ko. May isang utility din na grabe ang touching niya, kahit sinasaway ko na, ayaw pa din paawat. Grumabe yung mental state ko, sobrang lungkot ko, wala akong makausap non. Iniiyak ko nalang lahat pag uwi. Hanggang sa hindi ko na nakaya, nag pass ako ng resignation (I stated there na mag re render ako ng 30 days) kinausap ako ng supervisor ko, sinabi ko sakanya lahat, and the respond that I got was ""normal lang kasi mga lalaki"". I just don't get it. After a week of leaving that company I got admitted dahil sobrang stress ko, and hindi okay yung mental state ko. I can't even pray, napalayo loob ko kay God, sobrang layo. Kasi pakiramdam ko hindi siya nakikinig sakin, na ang useless ng prayers para sakin.

I went home, and it became worse. My Lolo, sexually harassed me. Grabe yung takot at panginginig ko non, kahit mismo yung papa ko iniisipan ko ng masama. Nanginginig ako pag lumalapit si papa sakin kasi nasa isip ko baka gawin niya din sakin yon. Hinihimas ni lolo yung braso ko, at hahalikan sana but I managed to avoid kaya cheeks ko lang nahalikan niya sabay sabing ""gabi gabi kita iniisip, kahit sa paghiga ko"". Sobrang down na down ako, sinabi ko sa auntie ko na medj close ko, and she told everything na din sa family ni mama, kasi side yun ng mama ko. Wala na ako grandparents sa side ng papa ko. After that, binaliktad pa ako. Kesyo ako daw nang akit at ginusto ko rin. Parang mabaliw ako non, sleepless nights. Kasi baka ano gawin niya sakin. Halos gusto ko na siyang patayin. Kapag naririnig ko boses niya nanginginig ako at naiiyak. Dahil sa sobrang depressed ko, I cut myself, I left so many scars especially on my wrist. I was so messy and fucked up, hindi ko maayos ayos sarili ko non, palagi umiiyak. Hanggang ngayon nasa bahay parin namin si Lolo. 

But now that I have my second job, na le lessen yung pagiging suicidal ko kasi grabe ang blessed ko sa workmates ko. They're so kind and positive.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1b36a4g/bullied_and_sexually_harassed/,t2_nt6tk31vu,1709228511.0,8
I was sexually abused once when I was a kid,"I‚Äôm 31F and no one knows this story. Today is my abuser‚Äôs birthday (my lolo) so nakikita ko naman face nya sa feed ko. This happened once, I am the type of person na naalala lahat. This happened when I was around 6 to 7 yrs old I don‚Äôt wanna elaborate pa pero sinabihan nya ko na wag ko daw sabihin and binigyan nya ko P10.00. Kaya noong namatay sya I didn‚Äôt feel any remorse. Sa sobrang love ko sa Mommy ko na I don‚Äôt wanna give her ‚Äúisipin‚Äù or sama ng loob di ko na sinabi sa iba. This is also one of the reasons but di ako close sa side nila.

I was sexually assaulted by my girlfriend‚Äôs uncle,"I just had to get this off my chest. I have this memory locked up for more than a decade, and everything is still very unclear.

This happened 11 years ago.

My ex-gf and I (m) were 17. She has this ‚Äúuncle‚Äù who supports her financial needs (i.e. tuition fees, allowance). Everything‚Äôs normal from the get-go.

I never knew much about her uncle, except that I knew he was around early to late 30s, he‚Äôs a distant relative of her father, he was dating a woman at that time, he has multiple teenagers (unrelated to him) living in his home and he pays for all their tuitions, and he works as a contractor.

My ex used to rant a lot about him, how needy he is (calling her anytime to go to his place), how he touches her inappropriately, blackmailing, and the like. She is forced to go to his place to pick up her allowance when he demanded to.

Here‚Äôs where things go down from here. I was invited by my ex to go to her uncle‚Äôs place to do the deed while no one was home. I, of course, obliged ‚Äòcos I was still a virgin. For some reason, she had trouble putting it in so we stopped and didn‚Äôt continue. But we were already naked.

When I got home at night, I received a text message from her uncle, asking if we did the deed. I denied at first but he said he has the whole thing video recorded from his closet. I told the truth. He said it was okay as long as I don‚Äôt lie to him ever again. I told my ex about this but she brushed it off and said that he was just bluffing.

Fast forward a few months, for some forgotten reason, instead of her picking up her allowance from his uncle, I had to do it. I had the impression of only picking it up and leaving immediately. I was wrong.

He invited me in, we ate takeouts, and he brought me to his bedroom. Calling back on how I told him the whole truth about me and my ex, he was curious on why she had trouble putting it in. He ask if I was big. My brain cannot process the moment. I was already nervous because I was totally unprepared for the situation, and was with a man twice my age and my teenage body is still underdeveloped.

He wanted to see my dick so he pulled down my pants out of frustration. He asked me to make it hard. He turned on his tv to play porn videos he has saved from a connected hard drive. 30 minutes of trying to get me hard by fondling it, but it never did.

I still don‚Äôt know as of today why but he gave up on making it hard and he played a different video. It was a sex tape, of my gf and one of her uncle‚Äôs teenage ‚Äúbeneficiaries‚Äù. I watched in horror and started sobbing on the bed. He ‚Äúcomforted‚Äù me, told me they were ‚Äúfubus‚Äù and told me to ‚Äútake care‚Äù of his niece. He gave me a ride to where my gf and I were supposed to meet. 

I was silent the whole day until my gf asked why. I told her the truth but she brushed it off as ‚Äúit was recorded with her uncle watching behind the camera‚Äù. I know she is being weird about it in the present but I was damn stupid at that time. She was a very problematic partner but that‚Äôs for another story.

I can never look at her uncle in the eye after that encounter.

I‚Äôm a 28 year old man now, a year of therapy, and currently in the healthiest relationship with a woman (whom the only person I ever told this story to). Even after my ex and I broke up 9 years ago already, her uncle is still living in my head, rent free. Especially, he‚Äôs the only account blocked on my facebook account.

i was sexually assaulted by a friend,"Okay since sinisipag ako maglabas ng pain sa life here na naman. So last June, I was drinking with my friends. So this guy friend told me na bibili daw kami ng additional drinks so ako naman, since close kami. Sumama sa kanya, he was like tipsy lang so ayon nag drive na siya. Not until mga 15 minutes na naglilibot lang kami pero may mga open naman na convenience store. He stopped the car somewhere dark and then told me na baka gusto ko mag f*ck kami. Of course, I told him i don't want to and I just want to go home nalang. But then, he got mad. I mean, he was fuming mad and i start crying na. He was touching my chest and i was shaking kasi natatakot ako. He started kissing me starting to touch my p*ssy. Yes, I can't do anything about it because i don't have any idea kung nasan kami. He r*ped me. When we got back he just pretended like nothing happened. He threatened me na if magsasabi ako kahit kanino babalikan niya ako. Is it my fault that I got scared and just pretended na okay ako?",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/yxywdg/i_was_sexually_assaulted_by_a_friend/,t2_uakbd9vb,1668712823.0,138
Very Insecure and demoralized about myself sexually. (Sexual content/Futanari trigger warning.),"Here goes. Tired as hell but I can't fall asleep so I've decided to write this.

First of all thank you for reading, It means a great deal to me. My name is Annabell.

I don't have many avenues where I can talk about how I feel and think that someone might listen willingly. So i'm trying here for the first time.

I am a Futanari. I'll leave to your imagination. However, throughout my years i've heard and seen a lot about how in porn or online, the concept of a woman with a penis is rather popular. And hell, even some circles tout us as ""being better than men"". I personally don't believe that, nor do i wish to see men opressed in such a way, but still. Throughout my life, as long as i've been able to search the web i've seen that there at least a good factor of people who really like people like me. 

However, I never seem to get a slice of this pie, so to speak.

Usually when I go around, trying to innocently ""spread love"", or in other words have some fun online. Be it in communities, roleplay, or even just some nice dirty talk, I can never really find these futanari lovers. Or at least not ones interested in me. Idk, maybe i'm just unlikable. Or not sexy enough.
Though there was an incident where someone said to me ""we don't want futas here, only men.""
That stung quite a bit, It makes me feel ashamed of who I am. And what I wanted to be. It makes me feel like I don't have a place or a niche I can fall into.


I've now kind of realized that i sound quite toxic, don't i.
I'm just a very sexual gal though, so being able to do these things is important to me.

I know that theres not much that can be done, other than wait the unspecified amount of time it would take to find someone who finds me attractive, but you know, I just wish it'd happen a little sooner.

Thank you for reading what I had to say.
I personally just kind of wrote this in the vain hope it'll help with these feelings after I sleep.
Goodnight reddit.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/162usyz/very_insecure_and_demoralized_about_myself/,t2_pln210i8,1693153379.0,7
[Sexual Harassment] Tinangka na naman akong gawing querida,"Ganito nalang ba palagi? Pangalawang lalakeng childhood friend ko na to na nanggulo sakin kahit may asawa / live-in partner / fiancee na sila.

Itago ko nalang sya sa pangalang Jason. Jowa ko sya nung high school. Matalino, magaling magsalita, medyo mayaman rin. Nung una magkaaway kami pero eventually na super inlababo ako sa kanya. Kaya niligawan ko at naging kami.

E may ibang gustong gawin si Jason. Di ko nalang sasabihin pero ayaw nya sa sex daw --- kasi may **ibang fetish** sya. E ako nga inlababo so binigay ko kahit ayoko naman talaga. Ginagaslight ko pa nga sarili ko na gusto ko yun kahit di naman.

EDIT: For the record, wala akong problema sa kink at fetish (meron din ako)...pero ang importante kasi ay MAY CONSENT at hindi mo pinipilit ang tao kahit ayaw nila.

Eventually nalaman ko na may pinopormahan sya sa school nya. So I broke up with him. Pero tanga nga, di ko binlock. Hanggang ignore lang. Kahit na may mga gf sya, nag memessage siya na humingi ng 'session.' Di ko pinapansin. Mga 10 years na ganyan yata. Minsan pumupunta pa nga sya sa bahay namin sa probinsya pag alam nya nandun ako. Tumatago lang ako at dinededma sya.

2024. Nagising ako na may halos 30+ missed calls. Tapos may tumawag. Antok na antok ako kaya sinagot ko. Si Jason pa rin, humihingi ng 'session.'

Chineck ko FB nya after almost 5 years. Puta, **kaka propose nya lang sa fiancee nya nung December**.

Nag panic attack ako. This is not the first time a married (or about to be married) man tried to make me complicit in their cheating. At ayaw na ayaw ko yan. Grabeng trigger ko yan. Nag breakdown ako ng malala.

Ganito nalang ba talaga tingin nila sakin? Kesyo open-minded ako at single pwede na nila akong babuyin ng ganito? Puta may mga morals pa ako. Kahit mag-alok pa sila sakin ng isang milyon, di pa rin ako tatanggap kung di gusto ng partner nila.

Binlock ko na talaga sya sa lahat. At gumawa ako ng Google Doc letter para sa fiancee nya, complete with screenshots. Pero sinabihan ako ni ate na wag nalang isend kasi daw baka aawayin pa ako. Seryoso na allegations ang sexual harassment na ginawa nya sakin. Pwede syang matanggalan ng lisensya. At may kapit ang pamilya nya sa pulitiko. Baka daw sasampahan ako ng cyberlibel. Kahit matatalo sila, mapapagastos at masestress pa rin ako.

Since then parang palagi nalang akong on the edge. Minsan galit, minsan breakdown. I feel so dirty. Kahit ngayon naiiyak ako. Ilang years na akong medyo okay sana pero puta ganito pa talaga ang start ng 2024 ko.

Kaya kayong mga gagong tao na nagche-cheat sa mga partner nyo. Sana iwan nyo nalang partner nyo pag di nyo naman nakukuha ang gusto nyo. Kaysa mandamay pa ng ibang tao lalo na yung mga ayaw naman ng ganyan.

And Jason, fuck you. I will talk to my lawyer friends and I will make you pay, some way or another.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/19efil4/sexual_harassment_tinangka_na_naman_akong_gawing/,t2_s1d5z,1706097703.0,46
The sexual abuse still lingers,"I was 12 that time. I'm already 22 now. Time went by. My abuser (stepfather) was no longer with me. But anyhow, it still lingers on me. I always think of it time to time. His face, the way he grin, especially his touch. I was diagnose with depressive disorder. The medicine helps. And it happen again, same routine. But I did something far braver; I almost committed suicide. To end this misery... to forget. I made an attempt to jump off a bridge, but I was unsuccessful. To realize that... It's not the end of my story. I haven't provide better life for my grandparents. I miss my dogs. I miss the smell of my books. I miss sunset. I miss coffee. The realization hits.  I am alive and it still lingers...but I am now the bravest, cause I live... and survive.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/17g8pyd/the_sexual_abuse_still_lingers/,t2_ffh60avu,1698251135.0,11

"I was sexually harassed, now I feel like all men are manyak.","TLDR: Minanyak ako ng band lead while in vacation and now its affecting how I interact with men in general.

I went to Iloilo to travel, when I was single I always travel alone kasi wala naman ako mahila na friends kaya I learned to enjoy my own company. I‚Äôve been to Vigan, Sagada, several mountains, beaches, Malaysia all alone and ngayon lang ako naharass. I guess what I‚Äôm trying to say it this is really my thing, d dahil broken ako or what.

My boyfriend at this time was also somewhere out of the country for work, he knows about my Iloilo trip and was very supportive about it. 

Now I‚Äôm the type or traveler na very chatty, as in. I like talking to locals, knowing their stories and what goes on in their life, this is how I enrich my experience, kahit magisa ako I always come home with a happy heart kasi full ako ng love nila due to their hospitality. 
Mahilig din ako tumanggap ng deals, as a solo traveler madaming nag o-offer ng extra food to taste, free rides and free activities - only heaven knows kung naka ilang free shit na ako, mabait din kasi ako as per them.

Anyway eto na, first night ko palang sa Iloilo hinatid ako ng owners ng kinainan kong famous batchoy-an sa airbnb ko, husband and wife sila and super kind. They dropped me off around 10:00 PM. Kaso, dahil maaga pa, nainip ako I went to a party place in Iloilo at around 12:00 AM, parang Poblacion nila kasi wala naman ako ibang mapuntahan na bukas ng ganung oras. Anyway I only went there to be entertained, comedy bar sana pero wala naman so when I heard a band playing, dun ako pumunta. 

This is where it starts. I was just minding my own business, drinking and watching the band lang. Maaga sila natapos mga 1:00 AM so nagulat ako kasi in Manila they continue playing till 4:00, actually felt stupid kasi sayang lang punta ko kasi saglit lang pala.

Then one of the band members approached me, ayan na nag start na yung ugali ko na akala mo nagfifilm ng documentary. From there, isa isa ng lumapit the rest of the band members, I was the only female pero I really didn‚Äôt mind kasi in my head gusto ko lang magkwento at makinig. I didn‚Äôt even drink a lot kasi babae ako eh and need to go home pa. Everyone was just having a good time lang, behave lang ako nakaupo tas sila nagbabaliwan sa gilid, nanonood lang ako at nakikitawa. One of the band members asked if they can drive me home, I declined kasi sabi ko I can manage, plus nandun lang sakayan ng taxi. Then isa isa ng umuwi band members, syempre nag paalam na din ako, the guy who first offered a ride home went out na din. Natira kaming apat with the band lead. 

Ngayon since konti nanga lang kami, I went to say my goodbyes na, but the leader insisted that he drives me home kasi dangerous daw. Syempre I declined. Kaso sabi nila jinajudge ko daw sila, wala naman daw silang gagawing masama sakin, grabe daw ako sakanila. Eh ang nasa isip ko nadin, regular sila tumutugtog dito so they wouldn‚Äôt ruin their reputation right? I knowwww it‚Äôs very stupid and naive of me, so dahil nahiya na din ako edi sumama nako, tyaka libre eh. 

Eto na, when we got in the vehicle the conversation was still very wholesome, until nag start na sya mag notice sa nails ko, gel polish daw yun and kissed my hand? I pulled it away agad Tangina kinikilabutan ako pag naaalala ko, I reminded him ulit that I have a boyfriend, I also told them this when they asked when I was single nung nasa bar palang, even showed them photos para clear na no agenda. And then I was kind enough pa to give him advices kasi nag dadrama sya na ang sarap ko daw siguro mag mahal kasi faithful ako sa bf ko now, tyaka lambot daw ng hands ko, I‚Äôm pretty and masarap kausap. Naisip ko nakainom lang to, what I didn‚Äôt expect was when he started to become aggressive and hugged me, tinutulak ko pa gently and I was saying I want to get off the car na, but he tightened his hug saakin and thats when I felt scared, kaya I was trying to open the door na but he kept pulling it close. I calmed him down nalang and kept sniffing the side of my neck, I then said I needed to pee, ayaw pa nya ko pababain nun but I said I might pee sa car nya so he let me go down, I went straight to the taxi na and just sat there in silence, iniinternalize ko pa what just happened. 

Kaso d pa dito natatapos, pag drop sakin ni kuya taxi, d ko na sya pinatawid, sabi ko ako nalang tatawid so he left me sa otherside ng road. Nagulat at kinabahan ako kasi I saw his car pullingover kung saan ako nakatayo, he fucking followed me home. He got off the car and he kept apologizing, ako I was just talking calmly and dismissing him kasi I just want to be inside the airbnb and be safe. 

Feeling ko ang ditry dirty ko kaya I went to the shower crying, I was so scared and disgusted, I also felt so stupid. I called my bf right away and told him everything. I spent the rest of my vacation in Iloilo na nagpapablotter, he isn‚Äôt allowed to play na dun sa restobar d ko na makasuhan kasi pinapabalik pako Iloilo also I don‚Äôt want to see him na.

Ngayon kahit genuinely nice na yung manong, like a tricycle or taxi or enforcer pag nag o-offer na na ihatid ako or nag iinsist sila to assist me even when I say ‚Äúdito na lang po kuya‚Äù, bumibilis heartbeat ko and I start to feel uncomfortable. I‚Äôm trying to brush it off kasi I know they aren‚Äôt all bad. I worry kasi baka d nako maging jolly person when talking to manongs when I travel, feeling ko lahat mamanyakin ako.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/18hf9h2/i_was_sexually_harassed_now_i_feel_like_all_men/,t2_8wxik0bvv,1702468834.0,51
Ang sarap sa feeling na crush ka ng isang tao na di ka sine-sexualize,"I'm sure a lot of women get messages like ""wow ang hot"", ""ang sexy"" or ""you're pretty/gorgeous"". Don't get me wrong, I appreciate any kind of compliment. Pero iba pala talaga pag na-iinspire sayo yung isang tao no? Nakakakilig haha

Recently, may nag chat sa messenger ko. Fb friend ko siya pero we don't know each other irl. Mutuals lang talaga kame. Anyway, lagi sya nag rereact sa stories ko. Then nag message sya ""pretty talaga. Hayaan mo ate magpapapogi at magpapayaman ako tapos liligawan kita. Antayin mo lang ako HAHAHA""

Wala naman anywhere sa profile ko na nagsasabing ganun yung hanap ko. HAHAHA ibigsabihin that's what he thinks I deserve? He wants to better himself for me. Ang cute lang. I stalked his profile, feeling ko he's a few years younger than me. Early 20s and nag aaral pa.

Makakahanap pa yan ng dream girl nya na iba. Natuwa lang ako na ganun effect ko sa kanya, na that's how he see me. Kumbaga he feels na he's undeserving so he has to improve muna.

I was sexually assaulted when I was 8 and I think it affected who I am today.,"I used to go to school with a school bus and at that time, absent yung friend ko so I was the last person na ihahatid sa bahay. Usually kasi kapag present yung friend ko na guy ay siya ang pinakalast na hinahatid. While we‚Äôre on our way home, sabi ng school driver ko ay umupo ako sa passenger seat. I thought sinabi niya yun kasi ako ang last na ihahatid pauwi so hindi ko siya tinawag big deal. I was 8, clueless about what was going on at that time. He then touched my breast and told me to unbutton my blouse. I wasn‚Äôt aware of what‚Äôs happening. Dahil siguro sa nawalan siya ng pasensya kaya siya na ang nag unbutton ng damit ko. I was only wearing a sando bra. Then he touched my breast and told me not to say anything sa kahit kanino kasi magagalit sila. Akala ko noon ay magagalit sila sa AKIN. But he did not stop. He even licked my breast. Hindi ko na maalala kung anong naramdaman ko that time. Umuwi ako ng bahay and since then, everything has changed. And then it happened again. And again. That time, sa pinsan ko naman na older sa akin. Maybe it was the reason kung bakit ko hinahanap hanap yung pleasure. Naging addicted ako. Now, I have a boyfriend and we both have a high sex drive. Every vacant, we will always find an opportunity para ma satisfy ang isa‚Äôt isa. Pero I don‚Äôt know kung paano ko sasabihin sakanya yung nangyari sa akin.

I am still not sure about my sexuality.,"ive really wanted this to open up to my friends but i couldn't, i am so scared na they'll judge me for who i am. ive been also hiding from my closet since haha ewan ko ba. 

since i was a kid, naging trato nila sakin 'tomboy' eka cause i act like it. maybe i am not like the other girly girls na naglalaro ng barbie dolls or smth. i am more palabas-in kasi, playing with other kids my age na lalaki. kaya one time pag-uwi ko, sabi ng mommy ko bakit daw puro lalaki kalaro ko. napaka-innocent ko noon, like ano naman masama don. 

oh well, time went by, i forced myself to like boys to get away from these 'discriminations' from my family or whatsoever. i dont know. nung grade 3 din ako, i had this one girl teacher na sobrang crush ko. nagpapapansin ako sakanya and pag naaalala ko nahihiya nalang ako. 

nung pandemic, may nakakausap naman akong lalaki. siguro na-attach ako sakanya kaya feeling ko siya yung naging first 'real' crush ko haha. pero i was uneasy about it dahil feeling ko may something na kulang e. 

now naman, may naging girl crush ako and di ko alam kung bakit ako obsessed sakanya. katabing room lang namin kasi siya sa school and nahihiya ako kapag nadadaanan ko huhu. idk what to do kasi hindi naman kami close, although club co-officer ko siya pero hindi kami masyado nag-uusap. pero nung nalaman ko na may nakakausap siya na shs din, nagulat ako kasi babae din hahaaaaa sayang. 

yun lang, haha di rin naman kasi ako ready mag-commit lalo na kapag ganto pamilya ko. i mean hindi ko pa naman alam kung matatanggap nila ako. pero dalawa sa family ko lesbian eh sooo idkk :v",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1991337/i_am_still_not_sure_about_my_sexuality/,t2_bw8hqyzvl,1705509935.0,13
It's either I'm gay or sexually traumatized,"So, me f(20) was probably sexualized when was grade 3 and she was a grade 6 student. Diko alam pano sya nag simula. Basta ito lang natatandaan ko.

Tuwing mag isa kami sa bahay nila, mag kapit bahay kami and don na nangyayari ung sexual things. Lagi sya ung nag iinitiate about it. Hindi ko alam ang ginagawa ko since hindi pa namin pinag aaralan ang mga sexual things before. Hahawakan nya ung kamay ko at sya na ung bahala kung ano gusto nya gawin don, minsan tinuturuan nya ako pano gagawin ko sa daliri ko, laruin ko lang sya tapos minsan pinapa dede nya ako sa dede nya at minsan namin pinapa dila nya ung pussy nya sakin. Diko na matandaan kung ano pa ginawa namin pero ganon rin sya sakin.

Nag tagal yon ng hindi ko alam kung kailan tapos umalis sila ng pamilya nya, diko alam san sila lumipat tapos after non, ginawa ko naman ung ginagawa namin sa playmates ko. Alam ko sobrang mali, alam ko yon, noon gusto ko lang maramdaman ulit ung pleasure na ginagawa namin before, meron isang bata, like more younger sakin ng ilang taon rin like her sakin. Kung ano ginagawa namin before with her(grade 6), ganon rin ginagawa namin. 

Nahuli kami ng parents ko. Hindi kona matandaan kung ano nangyari after pero alam ko it's so horrible. Sobrang sorry ko talaga don up until now na naaalala ko sya. Minsan nag kikita kami nung geade 6 at nung na huli kami, kunwari either di kami nag papansinan or nag kakamustahan lang. Hindi ko talaga alam ang nagyayari sakin before. Now alam kona kung ano mga sexual things pero the fact na kaya kong igo down don sa grade 6 girl na kapit bahay namin until now, she's married and have a child. She's acting like it never happened well, ganon rin naman ako.

Diko alam pero ready ako maging kabit nya basta magawa ulit namin ung ginawa namin before. Alam ko na kaya ko makipag sexual sa mga babae pero di ako sigurado about sa committed relationship. Dipa ako nagkaka jowa so diko alam pero sigurado akong kaya kong tumira ng babae. Diko to nakwe kwento sa kahit kanino before. Ngayon lang talaga.

"TW: RAPE, SEXUAL HARASSMENT & PEDOPHILIA i suddenly remembered all the sexual traumas i experienced like wtf","hindi ko na mabilang pala kung ilang beses ako nasexual harass ever since bata pa ako. from matandang lalaki na friends ng mama ko and papa ko before to uncles (even sarili kong tatay) and to teenage boys na akala ko kaibigan ko sila pero yung mga utak napunta lang sa tite. halos nakalimutan ko na to lahat. all my life  pala i was fucking sexualized, there are also times na late ko na narealize i was violated and harrased. i'm 22 and maybe around 6-7 years old was the first time i was molested. i feel so fucking dirty. is this a trauma response? how could i forget everything... 


right now. i'm also dealing with my nudes leaking bcs of hacking. I DON'T FUCKING GET IT. it's like my life has revolved around me being sexualized. being used by my body. i know even at 17, i was raped by my ex (the only time i was raped and thank the gods, hindi na naulit) and lost my virginity to him. boys would only approach me bcs of my body during my teens. there were times na pumayag nalang ako, pretended that i liked it but i never did. one of few regrets i'm reliving tonight. 

ano ba kasing meron sakin? malandi ba talaga ako? do i really look like uhaw ako sa titi? i know myself i don't, kaya ko mabuhay ng walang sex. i don't get easily turned on. depende nalang kung mahal kita. i have only given myself to people that i have loved. i had 5 exes. sometimes, pag binabastos na ako ng tao wala na akong pake. if being catcalled in public i would raise my finger at them. i can't say na masungit ako bcs when people greet me in public i would smile at them, even with stranger men, sometimes i would just avoid contact dahil di ko mapipigilan sarili ko na if they greet me i would eventually greet back, the same as through messaging apps i struggle when someone i know or an acquaintance would dm me i would feel rude if i don't reply. i recently knew that some of those people mistake that act of kindness as my move to show interest for them. that behavior of mine applies to all people in general. i can never ignore someone i know, unless they don't greet or talk to me first. my recent ex told me i was easy for it. i was too easy for men. was i really? should i change this behavior? 


mukha ba akong porn star? hindi naman ako kasing ganda at kasing sexy ni riley reid or lana rhodes para masexualize buong buhay ko. i don't even wear that much exposed clothes. not also the girly type manuot or even the skimpy ones (i have nothing against it). but why? bakit pa ako naging babae? ganito nalang role ng babae sa mundo? ang mabastos? maging katawan ng chismis na isang malandi, pokpok at kung anu-ano pa? and will not have to do anything about it kundi tanggapin nalang? accept the fate we'll be fighting for the safety of our bodies, of our well-being from disgusting men??? minsan talaga, kung hindi lang illegal pumatay. marami na talaga ang body count ko.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/13xtbq7/tw_rape_sexual_harassment_pedophilia_i_suddenly/,t2_9zbub6qtm,1685653474.0,7

I was never turned on by any guy before him. NBSB po ako. Never been kissed, never been touched. Never ko pa din po na try na i-pleasure ang sarili ko. Kahit nagbabasa ako ng mga smut at eroticas, never ako na turn on. Umiinit lang ng konti pakiramdam ko pero yun lang.

Pero with my guy, even thinking about him makes me wet at nafifeel kong nagko-contract yung ano ako. I once had a wet dream of him and me doing the deed, and after nun every morning na bumabyahe ako pa-school, ramdam na ramdam ko ang contraction na parang may hinahanap yung ano ko.

Kapag gabi naman after namin mag-video call, pinipilit ko na managinip na we're having s*x hahaha or sinasabi ko sa sarili ko na siya lang ang pwedeng pumasok at humawak sa akin and that makes me even turned on.

Even him saying I love you turns me on so much.

Sabi ng classmate ko sexual awakening ko daw ito. It's not the act, but the actor. It makes sense naman kasi bakit hindi ko 'to naramdaman sa ibang lalaki na mas good-looking and hotter.

Ang weird ko ba? Normal po ba 'tong nararamdaman ko?",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/z37r0c/sexual_awakening/,t2_snnrzjl0,1669256547.0,20
So over being sexualized,"Hindi ako ganoon ka-hot, pero men would ogle at my body every now and then when I wear smth form fitting. 

Went out for a walk earlier wearing shorts and a shirt and a man just literally stopped on his tracks to ‚Äúadmire‚Äù my body. Why can‚Äôt men like him do it discreetly? There‚Äôs nothing wrong with checking someone out as long as you make an effort that they don‚Äôt feel creeped out, I mean yeah , mahirap to. Pero. Sheesh. Did you really have to stare at me for a good 3-5 secs?

Confession of a First Time Cheater (non-sexual),"I (27F) is in a long term LDR relationship with my SO (28M) for eight years. He lives in Baguio. I am from Davao.

We were together since college (still LDR when we started) up until I started working and he entered law school. We only see each other 1-3 times a year.

Recently, life has been full of downers for me. I had 5 deaths in my family and friends over the past week and had pretty much put me in a slump.

To cheer myself up, I decided to attend a college friend's wedding. Atleast I have something to celebrate naman for a change. Masaya naman. The wedding was celebrated outside of Davao city so I have to take the bus home. It was a 4 hour bus ride. Friday night din yun so punuan ang bus sa dami ng commuter.

I was able to get a seat sa second to the last row ng bus. Nakatabi ko nag iisang afam sa bus LOL. He looks super handsome, clean cut and a well trimmed beard. I initiated small talk just to destress sa super siksikan na bus. 10pm na that time.

I found out British pala si kuya (30M) . He is backpacking his way around CDO and Davao. I smiled and positioned myself to take a nap.

Medyo maliit yung bus so di maiwasang nagkakadikit yung arms namin especially pag nakapatong sa arm rest sa gitna namin yung arm niya. Nakaidlip ako an hour into the bus ride. My hand was positioned beneath his arm rest para di awkward. Then umidlip ako.

Nagising na lang ako when I felt like something is touching my fingers.

He was slightly brushing the side of my pointing finger. At first, I thought accidental lang kasi his hand was above mine but then his hand started creeping into my palm, held two of my fingers and even started playing with my rings; slightly moving them from side to side (they are a bit loose).

At this point I still have my eyes closed kasi di ako makapaniwalang that was actually happening kasi lakas makawattpad but WTF my heart was racing!

Mga 10 minutes din siguro niyang ginagawa yun then I opened my eyes kasi I have to fucking see it baka nananaginip lang ako. 

I looked at my hand. 

I looked at him.

We had our eyes locked for a few seconds.

We both smiled.

He looked away to the window.

I closed my eyes again. 

After this, he folded the arm rest, and held my hand fully. His hand was above mine. He had big hands. He gently strokes the back of my hand from time to time. He plays with my rings. Then he positioned his hand inside mine, flicked my fingers from the inside for an opening and we had our fingers intertwined.

I opened my eyes for confirmation. Damn, di nga ako nananaginip. My hand is already resting above his right thigh; with him holding it tight. I cannot forget that small rose tattoo on the side of his hand.


As a committed woman, I could've stopped this. I should've stopped this but damn, it felt good. Everything felt good. Having a stranger hold your hand like he knew you needed it; like he knew I had a shitty week and I could use a little bit of warmth because everything felt so fucking heavy. I surrendered. I did a little squeeze on this stranger's hand in submission and just like that, we held hands for hours.

A few minutes before the last bus stop, I slowly took my hand back, repositioned the arm rest, acted like nothing happened, and left without looking back. 

Others might see this as super maliit na bagay but my SO is my first boyfriend. I have never flirted with any other guy other than him. I have never had any guy touch me other than him. I have never taken any interest in another man's attention other than his; until that night. I tell him everything but now, I have something I cannot say to him and it feels wrong and I feel so guilty.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/152xrbi/confession_of_a_first_time_cheater_nonsexual/,t2_2lxufruw,1689684985.0,0

Was I sexually violated?,"Feeling ko medyo mahaba to so please bear with me.

To give you a background, I had a live-in partner for one year and for some reasons, we broke up. Pangit yung break up namin and sobrang nawasak ako nun. 

So after three months, I tried using dating apps. I'm not looking for any relationships pa naman kasi medyo di pa rin ako okay. But I was lonely and I need someone to talk to. I met this guy and okay siya kausap. We were mostly talking about our mental health and we were encouraging each other. Minsan namention ko pa, dahil sa depression ko sobrang dumi na ng apartment ko. He offered to help me clean but I declined kasi pa ko ganun kakomportable na makita nya kong ganun. Besides, I live alone na since my ex left me.

Days and weeks passed and halos consistent na kami mag usap. Di pa naman ako nafofall but okay ako kausap siya. Until one time, nag aya siya uminom. Natanggap na daw kasi siya sa work and ako yung nag eencourage sa kanya. But he said, sa apartment ko nalang para hindi mapamahal kasi nga wala pa naman siyang sahod and all, alak lang kaya nya itreat. I'll admit that I became stupid sa part na to. Pumayag ako. I was so naive. Iniisip ko kasi wholesome lang since twing nagkakausap kami never na-brought up yung SPG topics. And oo, tanga nga ako kasi nung tinanong nya pa ko kung pwede mag cuddle before kami magkita, umoo ako. Sabi nya kasi nadedepress nanaman siya. God ang bobo ko. 

Ito na nga nagkita na kami and uminom na. Konti lang din naman yung alak. Konting shot palang tinanong na if pwede ako yakapin. Dito ko na naramdaman na may mali kasi gusto nya humiga kami. Pero inisip ko din baka kasi malungkot lang talaga. So niyakap ko kahit awkward. Tapos maya maya na nagpaalam kung pwede hawakan yung boobs ko. Sinabi ko ayoko. Sabi ko akala ko ba cuddle lang. Nakailang pilit pa siya. Tumalikod pa nga ako. Umupo. Pero kinululit ako kaya um-oo nalang ako.

Alam nyo na kasunod nun. Ginusto rin naman ng katawan ko e kaya di na ko pumalag. Inisip ko nalang, pagtapos ma-fall out of love sakin yung ex ko dahil hindi na kasi ako nag aayos, may gusto pa makipag sex sakin. Ang aggressive niya. Madalas nasasaktan na ko, pero di ko sinabi. Pinilit ko tinatak sa isip ko na, ibig sabihin nito may nagkakagusto pa sakin. Hanggang sa natapos yun. Di ko alam kung ano mararamdaman ko. Nag uusap pa rin kami after.

Pagtapos nanaman ng ilang araw nakiusap sakin. May problema daw sa bahay nila and gusto niya muna umalis doon. Nag memention pa siya na gusto nalang niya mamatay. Sobrang sensitive ako sa ganyan. Kaya nung tinanong nya kung pwede magstay ng 3 araw sakin, pumayag nalang ako. Sa tatlong araw na yun, palagi niya ko pinipilit. Di ko rin alam bakit parang wala ako sa sarili na pumapayag ako na babuyin ako. Kahit kasi sabihin kong ayaw ko kukulitin pa rin ako. Pag hinawakan na ko, wala na magagawa katawan ko. Naextend pa yung stay niya ng isang araw kasi nung inask ko siya nung 4th day kung anong oras siya uuwi, sinabi sakin na pinapaalis ko na daw siya. Nagpalusot nalang ako na aalis ako nung 5th day para umuwi siya.

Nag stay pa uli siya sakin ng 2 days after a week. Pinilit kong isipin na okay yung relationship namin. Siguro ginawa ko na ding rebound. Palagi niya binabanggit na gusto nalang niya mamatay, na nagpaplano na siya magbigti sa kwarto. Kaya pumapayag din ako. Ayoko ma-upset siya pag hinindian ko. Kaso naaapektuhan na rin mental health ko. Di na kasi ako komportable talaga sa ganung set up. Kaya nung huli siyang nag request, na kung pwede tumira nalang siya sa apartment ko habang wala pa siyang work, humindi na ko. Dun ko lang narealize lahat. Alam ko, tanga ako. Pero mabigat lang kasi talaga.

Dagdag ko pa, maladas din siya humihiram pero maliit na amounts lang. 50, 100. Di na niya binabayaran. 

Natatakot ako i-open to sa mga kakilala ko. Sasabihin kasi nila, bakit ko kasi pinag stay sa bahay kung ako lang nandun. Bakit ako makikipag inuman na kaming dalawa lang. Bakit ako pumayag. Pero pag naaalala ko kasi naiiyak pa rin ako. Kasalanan ko nga siguro, pero ayoko na sana marinig sa iba. Kahit ang bigat bigat na, kahit naiiyak ako pag naaalala ko at nahihirapan ako huminga. Kailangan ko lang talaga ilabas to.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/11bnpy0/was_i_sexually_violated/,t2_509cv3zl,1677339197.0,9
I was sexually abused as a child,"When i was a child my older sister sexually abused me. Being so young and naive at the time, how was i supposed to know what was right and what was wrong, i didn‚Äôt even really know what sex was. She talked me into performing sexual acts with her on several occasions.

At the time of the abuse, i believe i was about 7-8 years old, i am now 15. My brain has blocked out a lot of the trauma however i do remember short flashbacks from each time. At about age 13-14 i finally started to realise what went on in my childhood, i had suppressed all these memories and emotions for so long it was like it never even happened.

The first time it happened i was about 7 years old. My older sister, who would have been about 14 ish, took me into my own bedroom and began to show me what i now recognise to be a porn video. Before the video had got to any sort of sexual scenes she turned it off and decided to just ‚Äòshow me‚Äô what she wanted me to do. I couldn‚Äôt tell you what then happened as my mind has blanked out certain parts of the events but i can only assume it was something sexual. I don‚Äôt remember any more from that time.

On a separate occasion, i remember being in my mothers bedroom with my sister and my cousin who is a female and the same age as my sister (13-14). I have no clue how we ended up there but my sister then told me to take my trousers and pants off. Being a young child i did as i was told. My sister and my cousin then laughed and giggled at my private parts and mocked me for about 5 minutes or so. I remember the extreme feeling of embarrassment and just feeling completely uncomfortable. That‚Äôs all i remember.

Another time we were in my bedroom, she was performing oral sex on me, whether it was an accident or not i have no idea, but she bit my penis. I remember looking down and instantly there was a lot of blood. I cried and cried. I wanted to tell my mum so bad but in the back of my mind i knew what me and my sister were doing was wrong. In the end i told my mum that i ran into the corner of a table in my room and that was why i was bleeding. To this day i have no idea how she believed that, and the strange thing about it is she never took me to a&e or anything like that. I just feel like if that happened to a child you would. I can‚Äôt get my head around it.

There were quite a few more occasions where my sister made me kiss her, have sexual intercourse with her, perform oral on her etc.

Currently, I am in my last year of secondary school and i have sessions every 2 weeks with a private counsellor who specialises in trauma. My girlfriend and her parents, one of my friends and my counsellor are the only people who i have ever spoken about this to. I don‚Äôt think telling my mum is something that i could even think about doing anytime soon. My sister is now 21 and still lives at home with me and my mum. We never ever said a word about it since and our relationship is completely normal. It‚Äôs like it never happened. But it did.

Due to the trauma, i have been suffering with depression for the past year or two, i have gone through stages of heavy self harm but i am currently 2-3 months clean.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/16rwfc9/i_was_sexually_abused_as_a_child/,t2_rpnx104b,1695658553.0,3
Men who are victims of sexual harassment.,"Just wanted to shed light with this topic. As a man, I actually have some experiences. 

&#x200B;

\- In college, there's this 1 girl na kabatch namin na sobrang touchy to the point na questionable na yung touches niya. On my personal experience, nararamdaman ko yung chest niya na nakapress sa body ko on multiple instances. Other guys na kakilala ko had the same experiences from her. There's also some additional things that she does. She's also very touchy with her hand. May it be sa arms, body, shoulders, etc. There's also an instance that this girl touch and hinihimas hinas na yung legs ng friend ko, around crotch part na. 

&#x200B;

\- I was partying at a club once, then this gay man na nasa dance floor with us. I was just dancing actualy, then hinawakan niya yung arms ko and kinagat niya. I was frozen at that time.

I am confused about my sexuality and I‚Äôm pressured to choose,"For the longest time, I believed I was straight. Now, I am confused.

I dress boyish (mostly, button up and trousers) because of my upbringing and as a self-defense. I acted so tough in high school for me not get bullied. 

Fast forward in college, I was often assumed to be pansexual or bisexual. I am so vocal about people who have great visuals(boy or girl) that they think I am attracted to them. 
But deep inside, I was only attracted to guys and I only wish to be like the girls that I find pretty. 

One time, I have this friend, it was his birthday and we went to eat in a resto along with other 10 people. While waiting for the food, we were chitchatting. Then, my friend straight up said to me in front of other people: ‚ÄúDiba pansexual ka?‚Äù

I never said anything like that to him before. I was too pressured to say anything and just said: ‚ÄúNo. Ata? Hindi ko na din alam.‚Äù

I was sure of myself not until that incident. 
It struck my mind so much that I went to explore what I want. I was pressured that day bc I was put on the spot.

I opened a bumble account and started having sex with guys. I felt sure that I was straight after that phase.

But then, I have this mutual on all socials and go to the same school as me. We interact on likes and story views but that‚Äôs just it.  This girl is pretty but I know she is not straight bc she had a girlfriend before. She made me question myself bc I felt that I don‚Äôt just appreciate her, I want to get close to her.

All my life I believed I was only attracted to guys, but now, I am confused as to whether I like this girl, or I just want to be her friend. 
The thing I hate about this situation is that I feel pressured to choose because I‚Äôm already 22 years old and haven‚Äôt figured out what I really like.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/18o7tc1/i_am_confused_about_my_sexuality_and_im_pressured/,t2_q2xlcma0g,1703224129.0,3
Conflicted kung magpapapayat ba because of many sexual harassment stories,"So for context, I'm currently obese and I want to loss weight and wear cute clothes and the likes. But natatakot ako sa mga possible scenarios na baka may mangharass saken cause I would rather endure bullying(verbal) than sexual harassment. Add to my fear pa na I will be working in a male dominated industry(ME).

&#x200B;

Tapos meron pang isang post sa ibang ph subreddit kung ano mga experience nila regarding the matter and hindi talaga maiiwasan. Even if may mangyari, I don't think may magagawa ako so since hindi naman kami mayaman or may power. Kaya as much as possible I want to prevent or atleast be less of a target (ofcourse not saying na just because you are fat doesn't mean that its impossible for one to be a victim).

&#x200B;

Pumayat na rin ako dati when I was in college and not to sound arrogant, I am attractive plus I've always been confident. Back then, a lot of seniors and tried to take advantage of me, thankfully I have friends who tells me things so nakaiwas ako sa mga ganong klaseng tao pero syempre andyan pa din yung mga naririnig mo na binabastos ka and so on.

My sexual desire being fulfilled by this complicated man.,"
On March 15, we crossed paths through a dating app, and our messages ignited a spark that led to a captivating meeting on April 1st. 

Nervousness overwhelmed me as he took me straight to Victoria Court on our first meeting but there was an inexplicable warmth and comfort in his presence. 

I didn‚Äôt get out of the car as I was afraid something‚Äôs gonna happen between us. My ex husband is my first and last touch and I don‚Äôt know if I can be intimate with other person again. But I sensed his respect for boundaries, and we spent the evening chatting in the car. After two hours, he dropped me to my place, leaving me craving for his presence. 

He‚Äôs so warm and he made me feel at ease. Never felt this before with all of the dates I had. 

Pressly is a complicated guy. He has disorders. He is hypersexual and he is bipolar but I still want him. 

As our conversations deepened, we decided to meet again on April 20th, and I willingly gave him my consent. Our sexual encounter was nothing short of intoxicating. 

He‚Äôs so fucking addictive. 

Presly possessed an unparalleled skill, skillfully touching me in ways I longed for. 

He unraveled my desires, causing multiple orgasms, and his sweet words filled my mind, creating an insatiable craving within me.

He knows what he is doing and he‚Äôs fucking good with it. 

We continued talking and meeting for months, but my emotions remained uncertain, causing me to pull away at times.

We would exchange I love you  and I miss you but I am still uncertain with a lot of things so I push him away. Whenever I felt triggered, I would push him away. 

Paradoxically, every time I distanced myself, the hunger for him intensified. 

Pressly was like a drug, an addictive high that left me yearning for him during his absence. 

He‚Äôs not just like a drug to me, he‚Äôs also my happy pill. The medicine I want to consume for the rest of my life.

However, in the present moment, confusion clouds our status as he appears distant. 

Maybe it‚Äôs because of his work? 

Maybe because I push him away most of the time? 

Or maybe because he got what he wanted already and now he‚Äôs craving for a more exciting partner? 

I don‚Äôt know. I wanna tell him I want him, Im craving for him and I miss him but there‚Äôs something within me that is pulling away from him. 

Nonetheless, despite the uncertainty, one thing remains constant - my desire for him, an unyielding craving that seems to be a permanent fixture in my being. 

Always and forever, I want him.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/15blnog/my_sexual_desire_being_fulfilled_by_this/,t2_gda1205zg,1690513534.0,0
UNPOPULAR OPINION: We shouldn't normalize having romantic/sexual relationships with people way older than us.,"Or at least save that for when the younger party is already in their late 20s or early 30s.

A lot of you would be so angry for this. I'd actually be surprised if walang makikipagbardagulan sa akin because of this take.

**LONG READ AHEAD.**

&#x200B;

I see so many young women in their early 20s/teens casually dropping lines such as ""oh I have a boyfriend/fwb. He's 25."" 

We need to understand that *grooming does* ***not*** *only happen to underage women.* Legally aged adults can also be groomed. Adults can also be groomed by people the same age as them.

Just because someone is an adult, doesn't mean they are perfectly mature enough to consent into sex. Ano yun, pagkapatong nang 18, people would suddenly be enveloped in a veil of maturity and sound judgement? No. *I* was a dumbass when I was 18. Still am now. A lot of you probably were too.

You see, there is absolutely no good reason for a 25+ year old man to hit on an 18-20 year old woman. Good intentions? Wholesome intentions? If he *truly* has clean intentions, he wouldn't be entertaining someone way younger. 

The only reason these men go for younger women is because these girls are very impressionable. They're more likely to be coerced into having sex. They'd be easier to appease, easier to impress, and easier to manipulate.

It's not the younger party's fault tho. Having an older individual hitting on you must be an empowering feeling to a young mind. Heck, I'm a guy, but if a women 5-7 years my senior would hit on me back when I was 18-20 years old? I'd lose my mind and I'd probably feel attractive as fuck lol.

The problem here is the older party. If their intentions *were* truly genuine and wholesome, then they'd be dating people their age. They'd be having sex with people their age. 

But no. They intentionally target younger, impressionable women, because these men know that they'd be easier to coerce. Easier to have sex with. Some guys naman although they don't make the first move, pumapalag sa mga mas batang may gusto sa kanila. 

Why would they bother jumping through hoops and carefully dating mature women of their age, when they could get younger women who would be more likely to say ""yes"" into nudes? Into sex? Into a casual fwb relationship? Papakahirap pa sila trying to convince an older more mature man/woman, when they'd have these younger individuals who are very much eager to be hit on by an older person.

The validation is addicting. The attention is addicting. Most people don't see that they were being groomed until years later. 

And don't get me started on ""Ay, mabait naman siya eh. Hindi siya abusive, hindi siya kidnapper, he's respectful."" THAT'S THE POINT. You think groomers would successfully have sex with people way younger than them, if they acted aggressive, abusive, and mean all the time? No. They wouldn't get laid if they try to scare away the people they manipulate.

Just because he's nice doesn't change the fact that they are still groomers, taking advantage of a young person's impressionability.

&#x200B;

HOWEVER, large age gaps *can* work, but only if both parties are (1) consenting adults, and (2) independent and stable. Power balance plays an important role in all this. Much more important than age, and much more important than the *legal age.* You think that a 20 year old student has an equal power/say in the relationship as his/her 27 year old partner, who is already financially stable and working?

I know kink nang iba sa inyo ang pagkakaroon ng daddies. Large age gaps is a turn on for some people. But please let us **NOT** normalize this when the younger party is still impressionable and dependent.

&#x200B;

Point is: there's hardly any good reason why older people get into relationships and have sex with younger individuals. If they truly have clean intentions, then they'd date an older person who has whatever quality they want in a partner. 

Because the reality is, *older men hit on younger women because these girls are easier to prey on. Older men want to take advantage of the naivety, insecurities, need for validation, and impressionability these young women possess.*

&#x200B;

Just an off my chest because I see so many people on reddit, empowering each other into getting into relationships with people way younger than them, or people way older than them. This kind of culture is what propagates young people into thinking that being in a relationship with older individuals is perfectly healthy and normal, all the while being unaware that they're actually being groomed.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/uvqd8v/unpopular_opinion_we_shouldnt_normalize_having/,t2_kq7ngo5o,1653273655.0,72
My sibling (F29) questioned my (F25) sexuality,"I think this is a rant.. this is my first post. I've been worrying if it'll come out (haha) well as i would express myself.

I come from a religious background, but I'm not as religious as I was as a kid. I currently have a partner (F24). And being in a religious family' we're both closeted. People can view our relationship as both sisterly OR bff.

 I'm not saying I didn't expect my family to find out, to be specific my sister, she's really religious, and it scares the shit out of me when she popped the question this week, not once but twice.

My partner don't see the possibility of coming out to our families, and it probably written in history as I was best friends with someone. We don't mind. Even if it aches for the thought of them to hate us for this. 

I think I've been vocal enough to my friends about this because it's a repetitive controlling matter. 

Controlling, they're verbally abusive even if it's not about my sexuality. Maybe it's just cultural. But I'm tired. I really am.

I'm an adult, recent grad. Trying to save up from gigs. I can't even leave the city I live in to find work and my family wants me to work abroad. But it was discussed I AM allowed to leave this city and head to the capital for more work opportunities. 

I'm allowed to breathe, but it's hard because of my cultural background. Homebound, not allowed to leave the house, curfews. I know it's for my wellbeing and they're looking out for me. 

I think it's the mental preparation that I really wished I never needed. I just want to be accepted as is. What terrifies me is that my heart sinks when my mother talks about a relative or someone she knows that isn't straight and they are a waste of beauty. 

I feel safe with my partner. And I know eventually when my family may find out, I hope I'm financially independent, and able to find a place to stay IF they cut me off. 

I have a good circle of friends that are willing to lend me a hand. But I know, I just know they'll cut me off, they'll cuss at me, curse me. And I don't want to hear it. I'd rather just disappear. I'm afraid.

Was i sexually assaulted? Groping / flashing,"So i was reading about trauma and how neurotic behavior can show up later in life

Recently, i remember some traumatic and unsafe experiences during my high school (exclusive male) days 

1. Groping Genitals: On several occasions, this gay classmate of our snuck up behind us to grope us either by directly fondling our genitals for a split second. We felt helpless as people were just laughing about it and this happened to several of us in the class

2. Groping buttocks: on several occasions, what we thought were straight male classmates would attempt to stick their pointer and middle finger up our buttocks (while our pants were on). They played it off as a prank and i and several others have been victimized by this. After several years, we find out some of these perpetrators came out of the closet and turned out to be gay along

3. Unsolicited Flashing of genitals: on some occasions, some (what we believed to be straight) males would flash their penises during our gym / physical education classes during the time we would change clothes. Again, i and several others were victimized by seeing unsolicited actual penises. We still do not know if the perpetrator is gay

Sexual frustration-fueled-rant,"Throw away account.

Me and my girlfriend have been together for 6 years. Since college pa kami, so you just know we've done the deed. 

Eto yung source of frustration ko. When I'm in the mood to have sex laging ayaw niya. Kesho wala daw sa mood, not feeling well, natatakot daw na baka mabuntis (I use condoms and nag pupull out pa nga ako kahit may suot na), etc. Sobrang bihira lang yung papayag siya. Kapag nilalandi ko hanggang dry sex lang kami parati. BUT when she is in the mood, dapat ready ako palagi. Kahit super busy ko sa sideline/wfh ko dapat G ako makipag jugjugan. Kapag hindi ako pumayag sasabihin I dont find her beautiful or sexy anymore which is not true. Sobrang sexually frustrated ko lang kasi nagkita kami recently. 3 months kaming di nagkita so imaginin niyo nalang pag ka thirsty ko sakanya. Pero ayon, walang nangyari. Nanatiling tigang ang koya niyo. 

TL;DR: Ayaw diligan ni jowa ang nanunuyo kong lumpia, pero pag gusto niya magpa tuhog dapat G ako kahit busy ako. :(",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/10c5zw5/sexual_frustrationfueledrant/,t2_vjy9kz0q,1673743932.0,1

Sexual Harassment,"I'm just disgusted sa mga ibang Pinoy on how they react on sexual harassment. If you're handsome or pretty and you're a victim of sexual harassment? Everybody will care, everybody will become your light shining armor. If panget ka, no one even bats an eye. They will even make jokes about sa nangyari sayo like me. I'm a victim of sexual harassment and I told what happened to my friends and ganito yung naging reply nila.

""May booking ka ba tapos ayaw mo sa kanya?""
""Lakas ng kamadag ni <Insert my name here>""

Yep. Habang nanginginig ako sa takot, ganyan yung mga sinasabi nila. They don't even bother to asked me if I'm okay or need ko ba ng kasamang umuwi.

Tama nga yung kasabihang.

How does anyone deal with sexual harassment at home?,"I‚Äôm losing trust and respect on my father

We used to be a happy family. I used to admire him.


But he cheated on my mom multiple times already.. and i was the one who caught him.. 

Isa sa mga babae niya was about 21 to 23 years old ata. Kaedad ko lang.

Then i once saw porn on his phone and it‚Äôs about families having sex together. Kadiri. Nakakatakot.


He would barge in my room without knocking. Minsan saktong pag nakahubad o nag bibihis ako. Whenever i go out of my room to go to the living room or kitchen, i would see his eyes wander sa legs ko.. minsan sa butt..


Di na ko lumalabas ng kwarto ng walang bra dahil grabe nga siya makatingin. Pero pag labas ko kanina para sana mag banyo, nakita ko siyang nakatingin sa dibdib ko.



Natatakot ako na naiiyak. Never naman niya akong hinawakan. But somehow, i feel violated. He even told me one time ‚Äúkung di lang kita anak..‚Äù di na niya tinuloy. Joke niya lang yun pero nag marka sa isip ko.

"The struggles of finding a genuine connection in a fast-paced, looks-oriented and sexual-driven era...","As the title suggest, ngayon ko lang na realize na ang hirap pala makipag date or get to know someone, well at least for me, sa masyadong madalian and puro kalibugan na environment.

Non consensual touching na di naman sexual? Pero kaseeee,"Grabe lang kanina sa jeep may sumakay kasing lalaki na nasa mga mid 30's na decent looking naman and mej malaki katawan.

Parang yung ginagawa ng mga kids/matatanda na mej hirap sumakay ng jeep yung humahawak sa tuhod/legs ng mga nakaupo ganun.

Nagulat ako kasi usually nga mga bata o matatandang babae lang gumagawa nun. Okay naman yung paa nung kuya kasi nakita ko syang naglakad pasakay ng jeep. Nung nakaupo na yung lalaki nagkatinginan kami nung katapat ko halatang nagulat din sya e. Bata pa sya very student like yung datingan tapos naka maikling short na kita half ng legs.

(26F) I just confirmed that my boyfriend had a sexual relationship with his cousin last year,"I just confirmed that my boyfriend had a sexual relationship with his cousin last year. I already confronted him about it months ago pero di padin nawawala sa isip ko and sabi nya naman sakin kiss lang daw nagawa nila, wala daw nangyari kasi alam nila limits nila but last week nag overthink ako. Di kasi ako naniniwalang walang nangyari sakanila kasi namention nya pa sakin dati na napunta din dito pinsan nya at tabi sila matulog dito sa kwarto nya. Di naman ako tanga para paniwalaan agad sinabi nya kasi they're 2 adults tapos may gusto pa sila sa isa't isa and nasa iisang kwarto sila (duh)

So I looked at their convo from last year (november) ayun yung time na napunta pa sya sa pinsan nya dun natulog sakanila then chineck ko lahat ng history ng social media apps nya, pati nga sa online shopping acct nya. Then nadiscover ko sa shopping acct nya na nagbibili sya ng c*nd*m and s*x toy dated november. Nakita ko din sa snapchat acct nya na may d*ck vid sya sa ibang cr. So nagback read ako sa ig nya ng convo with his cousin, ayun nakita ko na yung date ng dick vid ay nagmamatch dun sa date kung kelan sya nakitulog don sa pinsan nya.

I feel so devastated right now kung ano gagawin ko, sleepless nights and wala akong peace of mind sa situation ko. Alam kong matagal na yun and last time na nagkausap sila ay january pa pero di padin mawala sa isip ko nandidiri ako sa ginawa nila. Nakilala ko sya bilang matinong lalaki pero nung nalaman ko yun parang nasira na tiwala ko sakanya kasi parang kung sino nalang magkaroon ng interest sakanya ay kayang kaya nyang patulan, ultimo pinsan. Saka he lied na wala nangyari sa kanila pero syempre wala naman aamin sa ganun at knowing na baka nahihiya lng sya umamin or ayaw nya akong masaktan sa katotohanan but still ang sakit sa feeling na andaming sinisikreto ng partner mo.

And btw this 2023 lng naging kami and live in na.

confusion after years (sexual abuse),"// be kind, don't judge my grammar im dyslexic and bisaya‚Äì not good at tagalog //

I was sexually abuse when i was 8 years old by our neighbor at my grandma's province who is 15 at that time and this only happened once. i didn't know that what he was doing was rape kasi before that incident he always tells me story about sexual acts (which i thought laro lang and walang malisya) like he put his to his female friend while laughing at sasabihin nya na it feels good. 

I am 21 now, I'm confused since I'm different from other victims who got traumatized over it I mean  hindi ako naiiyak everytime i remember it pero never na akong bumalik sa province after realizing what he did. i think develop hypersexuality, it's embarrassing but i'm addicted to porn, reading nsfw since high school started when im 12 but never sexually engage with anyone and never gotten into relationship. it also gross me out that im fantasizing myself being rape or being in very toxic relationship that involves violence. i confuse and feel guilty about this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/x8vhxd/confusion_after_years_sexual_abuse/,t2_sazcyt4u,1662628284.0,11

"Young, Gullible, and Sexually Abused","Hi! I am turning 21 this year. I have this secret that I have been keeping to myself for more than 10 years already. 

When I was around 7-9 years old, I had a sexual experience with my cousin. That time, he was still a minor, a teenager, he was around 14-16, I think.

It started when he called me one day while I was passing by their house. He was alone as his Mom and sister wasn't at their house. Since he called me, I went to him. I don't exactly remembered what happened basta he explained to me na we're going to play. He was the father, I was the mother. We kissed, he put his pen*s on my mouth and even f*ck me in between my legs. There was no penetration.

I don't really know why did I allowed him to do that to  me. I guess I was young, obedient, and gullible so I did everything he told me to do. He also told me not to tell it to anyone because it's our secret. Also, if I tell anyone that we played, that he was the father and I was the mother, they will think that I was gay. Everytime I pass by their house, and when no one is around there, he would always call me and we would do those sexual acts. He did all of that to me in the different parts of their house. I remembered him cumming on my face, my belly, my ass, even forced me to swallow his semen. He would always take me then to their bathroom and clean me after.

Kahit na naglalaro ako with our other cousins tatawgin niya ako and he would kiss me and tell me to jack him off. Nasanay ako sa ginagawa namin kaya hindi ko na naisip na mali pala yung ginagawa namin, na inaabuso na pala ako. Yung mga ginagawa namin, it lasted for more than a year. I was really glad when I realized na yung ginagawa namin is hindi normal kasi hindi ko naman yun ginagawa with my other cousins and hindi rin yun ginagawa ng iba kong cousins with him or with our other cousins.

When I realized na I was being sexually used and abused, ako na ang umiwas. I stopped going to their house, I pretended that I didn't heard him everytime he would call me, and as much as I could, I avoid him. After several weeks if ignoring him, nag stop din naman siya. Hindi na ukit nangyari yun.

Remembering the days that I was sexually used and abused by my cousin, I always felt that I was also the one to blame for letting him abuse me. If I wasn't so gullible, sana hindi nangyari yun. Hindi ko na nasabi pa kahit kanino yung nangyari kasi takot ako and until now natatakot pa rin ako dahil una sa lahat, mali yung ginawa ko. As a child, naakot ako na baka pagalitan ako kaya I kept it to myself, thinking na mas mainam na hindi malaman ng iba para hindi ako mapagalitan. As an adult today, I am keeping it to myself because I am afraid na baka walang maniwala. I am afraid to tell it to anyone kasi nakakahiya.

As a child, I thought makakalimutan ko rin pero forgetting it wasn't as easy as tearing a sheet of paper pala. Dala dala ko siya until now. And everytime na nakikita ko ang cousin ko na to, naaalala ko yung mga ginawa niya sa akin. Kapag ako lang mag isa, naaalala ko rin ang mga ito. And it always break my heart. Halo halo na yung nararamdaman ko. Regret, hatred for him and myself, pity, sadness, hindi ko na ma specify yung nararamdaman ko kasi halo halo na.

Mas masakit pa dahil he is living his best life ngayon habang ako dala dala pa rin ang bigat ng mga pinaggagagawa niya sa akin. I am sharing my story to you hoping na mabawasan yung lahat ng negative emotions na nararamdaman ko kasi after more than 10 years of keeping this secret, at last, I was able to tell someone about it.

I hope y'all have not experienced what I experienced. I hope na hindi niyo siya maranasan ever. Thank you for reading my story.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/10tnkes/young_gullible_and_sexually_abused/,t2_4hqqxdr8q,1675535594.0,6
"pera, attractiveness, at sexual pleasure lang ba talaga nagmamatter sa isang relationship?","a few days ago, my s/o got mad at me. made remarks about my appearance, my body, and the fact that i don't have money to give them. for context, we're both still students. i'm currently looking for a source of income, but it's hard to get accepted when you're still an undergrad even if it's for part-time jobs. 

nakakapanlumo na you can tell me na money is all you care about sa relationship natin kasi hindi naman ako ""hot"" or ""packing."" i hate how sayo okay lang maging volatile and i just have to sit here, be patient and understand where you're coming from kahit na grabe ka na makasakit.

we've been in this relationship for a while, and while I haven't been the best partner, lagi akong ready para magbago at ayusin yung sarili ko pag may nagagawa akong mali. they keep telling me na gusto na nyang umalis sa relationship, pero never nyang magawa kasi kailangan nya pa raw ako sa buhay nya. nakakapagod lagi yung gagamitin sakin na kasalanan ko raw kung bakit sya laging galit at kung bakit nagkaleche-leche lahat, pero tinatry ko naman eh. nageeffort naman ako. 

at this point hindi na sayo nagmamatter na napakalapit nating magkaibigan. yung suporta ko sayo, yung kindness at understanding na binibigay ko sayo, wala. literal na yung pagmamahal ko para sayo wala nang bigat, kasi all you care about now is the surface-level shit. 

yung perang nauubos, yung attractiveness na nabubulok, at yung sexual pleasure na malalanta rin. 

i'm so drained by this relationship. i will never be good enough, and my partner is extremely unavailable emotionally. i've tried so hard to tolerate lagi yung mga hurtful words nya pero it's becoming more and more frequent na lately and i have no one to turn to for comfort. i don't feel safe being myself around them, and i can't run to any of my friends.

"AITA for ignoring my sexual assaulter, my cousin?","so all of us were really close before she manipulated me into giving her permission to do what she wanted. i was 13 when this happened and she was 18. she groomed and emotionally abused me before she sexually assaulted me. she also made me think she was going to rape me, self harm, or kill herself if i said no. so i allowed her so things wouldn‚Äôt escalate. my panic attacks started a few weeks after the assault and i didnt know that the cause of it was actually her. my sister was the one who figured it out and she supported me when my parents wouldnt. i dont think i would still be here without her. so we confronted her and her mom. she didnt suffer any consequences, just us avoiding and not talking to her. fast forward now, my grandma came back from the states to retire in our country. she is staying in our grandmas house (but my dads land). it was the first time i saw her in months. i got a panic attack in the roof deck and she was there. she kept telling me she was sorry and if it was possible to apologize everyday, she would. the day after that, i just ignored her but my siblings got kinda close with her again. it hurts honestly but i didnt tell them anything because i feel like its not my place to. AITA for feeling sad because my siblings are getting close with her again and for ignoring her?

im so sick of the stigma surrounding sexually active women,"tw slut shaming. I live in a province in visayas pala for your reference so very traditional mindset ng mga tao dito. A few months ago, i was assaulted. Pero all the blame and shame is nasa akin lang haha.  Kahit i said no several times sa guy na gumawa nun sakin. To the point na tinatawag akong p\*k2x tas its my fault daw for being so easygoing kahit d ko na gusto ginagawa saken. Bata man o matanda, may opinyon tungkol saken hahaha they make up stories about me pa. I just wanted to have fun outside sana. Guess its my fault for not being careful and having low self-worth.   


My family is close minded about sex pero they were very understanding about what happened to me. Ilang beses na ko nila pinagsabihan na delikado sa labas pero d ako nakikinig. Hanggang sa may nangyari saken pero d nila ako hinusgahan.   


Ngayon, may bf nako. Were very sexually active. At some point, gusto ko sabihan parents ko since im starting to see them as a safe space ever since they found out about the incident. Pero lately naging suspicious sila samin. Yung tono parang naddisappoint and they think my life revolves around my bf nalang.  Gets naman na responsibility namin if ever mabuntis ako pero i just feel sad na akala ko masasabihan ko sila, na they wont get judgemental pero sabi pa nga nila sex is bad daw hahaha. Sinasabihan pa akong hindi na ako nagaaral ng mabuti. Now i feel like all my efforts sa school is nothing to them. I get their point naman. Lalo nang hindi pa ako graduate. Please lang, pati ako ayaw ko ng anak jusko. Pero nagkakaproblema lang naman because of how boomers and traditionalists see it. I just wish everyone is more accepting.   


I guess napapagod lang akong magadjust sa mindset ng mga tao. Im tired of being put in a box and being labelled. Iniiwasan kong makatapak ng ibang tao pero at the end of the day, they still see me as this slutty girl na out of control.

I tried Spakol for the first time and it kind of made me question my sexuality,"About me: 24 M, still a virgin, raised by strict parents I‚Äôd say. Also don‚Äôt want to be in a relationship yet as I think I‚Äôm not that stable yet.

Anyway, I decided myself to have someone else jack me off. Went to a happy ending massage with zero knowledge. I already researched a spa and already have the girl I want kaso sabi ng receptionist wala siya so I think I made a mistake by asking her kung sino yung kinukuha palagi dito. Her answer is ‚ÄúSige sir ako na mag masahe sayo‚Äù.

The massage went on it was mediocre tbh until don sa jajakolin na ako. This was my first time being stroked by someone else and she also let me touch her boobs kaso dito ako na-weweirduhan, walang stimulation sakin at ayaw akong tigasin or malibugan.

To be fair, parang puputok na ata nang dugo yung ulo ng burat ko sa sobrang diin mag stroke ni ate. She then said na mag concentrate ako tas humiga siya sakin I got semi-erect tas sinimulan niya ulit ako jakulin as well as licking some parts of my body. Doon ako nilabasan but alam mo yung lalabasan ka pero hindi 100% yung tigas? Ganon yung nangyari sakin. It felt good but underwhelming.

I payed the fee as well as gave a tip. Kaso dito ko na-realize na baka gusto niya lang makuha yung tip kaya siya nag volunteer? Tas walang kwenta pa yung massage na nakuha ko dapat ata nag research ako ng 2nd option ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

[TW SA] I didn't cry after my gf told me that she was sexually abused before.,"So, about a month ago, my girlfriend she revealed that she'd been sexually abused before. I didn't know how to handle it, and it's been weighing on me ever since.

I feel guilty as hell about my initial reaction. My heart was heavy, I was low-key shaking, and I couldn't help but feel angry‚Äîfor her, for the situation. The thing is, I didn't show any of that. I froze, lost for words, not knowing how to comfort her. I was worried that anything I said might sound clich√© or rehearsed, like the standard ""It's not your fault"" or ""Thanks for sharing, it must've been scary."" And I really do care about her; I just wish I could've been there for her in the moment and just held her. 

To make it worse, we're in a ldr, so she shared this over a call. I can't even remember what I said, or if I said anything at all. Instead of offering the comfort she needed, I tried to cheer her up by distracting her and changing the subject, because she'd mentioned before that distracting her helps when she's feeling down. I'm dumb as a fucking rock. 

I've been dwelling on this, feeling guilty and realizing I mishandled the situation. Ever since then, I've been actively practicing how to be better at comforting her and finding the right words to say whenever she shares something with me. But I can't help thinking that I wish I had been more prepared at that time when she told me about it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/180fnpe/tw_sa_i_didnt_cry_after_my_gf_told_me_that_she/,t2_eajjsqtkb,1700569084.0,4
Sexual Awakening,"Share ko lang kung paano nangyari yung sexual awakening ko.

My first sexual experience was with my girl playmate when I was a child. I'm also a girl btw. 6 years old palang ako nun, sya yata 9 years old. Naglaro kami ng kasal-kasalan. Siya yung groom, ako yung bride. Ginawa pa namin parang gown yung kumot. After ng wedding ceremony lol, may parang honeymoon kami. Kung tama yung naaalala ko, nagkiss at grind kami.

Nung 10 years old naman ako, may kalaro rin ako na girl second cousin na ahead din sa akin ng 2 or 3 years. Kapag naiiwan ako sa bahay namin, pumupunta sya doon tapos naglalaro kami ng bahay bahayan. Siya lagi nag-iinitiate ng sexual stuff. Di naman ako pumapalag pero aware ako nun na bad yung ginagawa namin. Ikikiss niya ako, papahubarin, kinakain nya yung pussy ko tapos papatungan nya ako. Madaming beses nangyari yun. Minsan niyayaya niya ako sa bahay nila kapag sa kanila naman walang tao. May time na nag-away kami ng pinsan ko na to tapos sabi nya isusumbong niya raw ako sa mama ko na nakikipag-iyutan ako lol. Nastop na to nung lumipat na kami ng bahay nung first year highschool na ko. May dalawang anak na yung pinsan ko na to ngayon.

I also remember nung ako naman ang naging bad influence sa pamangkin ko na anak ng pinsan ko na girl din. Elementary palang din ako nun. Nasa kwarto kami sa bahay ng tita ko. Ginawa ko sa pamangkin ko yung ginagawa sa akin ng pinsan ko  except dun sa kain pussy. Naalala ko tinatanong ko pa yung pamangkin ko kung masarap ba yung ginagawa ko tapos umoo naman sya. Grabe lang ako diba. Every time na naalala ko yan, nakakaramdam ako ng guilt lalo na nung maagang nabuntis yung pamangkin ko na yan. 17 palang sya nung nabuntis sya. Naisip ko na ako yung reason kung bakit maaga sya nagcrave sa sexual stuff. 

So ayun nung lumipat na kami ng bahay wala na ako kalaro. That's when I started playing with myself. Pero puro pillow humping lang ginagawa ko nun. Hindi pa ako aware na form of masturbation pala yun haha. Hindi ko pa rin alam yung  term na orgasm at clitoris nun. Basta alam ko lang magstop na ako sa paghump kapag nafeel ko na nasarapan na ako. 

Naging aware lang ako sa other forms of masturbation like clitoral stimulation nung may nakausap ako sa omegle na nagturo sakin paano gawin yun. I was already in college when I learned how to play with my clitoris. College na rin ako nung natuto ako manood ng porn at natry ko yung other forms of masturbation like grinding against furniture, using shower heads or bidet pati yung syntribation. Clitoral rubbing ang favorite ko. Never ko pa tinry magfinger dahil satisfied na ako sa ganon. Sobrang bilis ko lang labasan like kaya ko magcum siguro within 3 mins? Basta mabilis lang lalo na when I'm hearing male moans. Kaya nga ilang beses ko na rin natry yung SOP thru voice call dahil sobrang natuturn on talaga ako sa ganon. Di ko gusto yung video call. Never pa ako nagpasend ng nudes at never pa rin ako nagtake ng nude pics. Male audio lang talaga sapat na hahaha.
 
Walang nakakaalam ng dark side ko na ito. Ang alam ng mga nakakakilala sakin inosente ako. 23 na NBSB kasi ako. Di nila alam na isang akong horny virgin lol. Ewan ko ba. Nakokonsensya na nga ako dahil sa sobrang libog ko kaya nga goal ko sana wag na magmasturbate this 2022 kasi feeling ko ang bad girl ko na talaga hahaha. Pero ewan. I can't resist lalo na pag nakakarinig na ako ng male moans hahahahaysss. 

Pero minsan napapaisip ako na buti natuto ako magself-explore kasi hindi ko na need ng ibang tao to satisfy my sexual needs hahaha. Feeling ko strong independent woman ako. Char! Hahahaha. Madalas man ako horny pero di ko trip mag-enter into fwb/fubu setup. I can't see myself doing real sex with a partner anytime soon. Di pa ko ready sa ganon. Di pa ako ready madagdagan yung nakakita ng body ko aside from my playmates nung bata ako lol.

Virgin in all ways pero sexually attracted sa nag-iisa kong best friend,"Throwaway account. I just want to get this off my chest. So I (26F) am sexually attracted sa bestfriend ko (28M). We've been friends for 10 years now, since college magkaibigan kami. I have other friends naman pero iba yung samahan namin, yung tipong alam namin talaga baho ng isa't isa. We are each other's emotional support, at pag nagoopen up kami about topics like politics, career, finances, family, relationships, talagang we speak what is on our mind kasi alam namin no judgement naman sa aming dalawa. Nauunawaan nya ang thoughts and feelings ko, at ganun rin ako sa kanya, at narerealize naman yung mga bagay na hindi namin naiisip through each other's POV. Solid talaga yung friendship namin kasi emotionally compatible kami. Nakapagtravel at inuman narin kami ng kaming dalawa lang.

I've been single for a very long time higit 5 years na. Virgin in all ways as in siguro pwede na kong ialay sa mga bulkan para matigil ang mga delubyo, or di kaya e pwede na kong alternative sa mga coconut oil ganon. The last person i kissed is my BF pa which is years ago na nga, and no sexual experience as in zero. No 2nd base or 3nd base or kahit hanggang basement wala talaga. 

My bestfriend is recently lang din naging single from a long term relationship. He is bi, at naattract naman daw sya sa girls, pero mas preference nya ang guys. Opposite kami kasi sya ay sexually active, and marami na naging hookups although puro oral lang daw at momol from di narin nya mabilang kung ilang guys na.

Now, sexually attracted ako sa kanya, at ngayon eh wala naman iba in my mind na gusto ko itry magexplore kung hindi sa kanya. Tipong turned on ako pag nagppost sya ng pictures nya sa gym kahit nakadamit naman sya. One inuman time with friends, sinabi nya lang din sa aming lahat doon na if ever after ilang years e wala talaga kaming mahanap, e kami nalang daw. Pero i'm not sure if gusto ko syang maging asawa at this point eh. Ang sigurado ko lang e turned on ako sa kanya physically. 

There was this one time na patawid kami sa kalsada at napahawak ako sa braso nya, tapos nung nakatawid na kami sa kabilang side ramdam ko talagang uminit yung buong katawan ko, yun tipong kinailangan ko lumayo sa kanya ng onti habang naglalakad kami kasi feeling ko baka madaplisan lang nya ko ng kahit daliri lang e baka mahalikan ko na sya at that point. Bago sa akin yun feeling na yun kaya di ko rin alam paano ideal.

Indirectly ko nahint from before pa na physically naman he thinks na cute ako, pero never syang gumawa ng kahit anong advances kahit na dalawa lang kami sa iisang kwarto at parehas kaming lasing. Nasabi nya rin sa akin na ayaw nyang nafifeel ko na hindi ako safe pag magkasama kaming dalawa.

I'm not even sure if gusto ko ba ng romantic relationship with him, probably hindi. Pero pakiramdam ko talaga gusto kong magexplore sexually with him, kasi comfortable rin ako sa kanya at type ko rin naman looks nya. Natatakot akong sabihin sa kanya lahat ng to kasi pakiramdam ko papayag sya, at parang hindi ko kayang isugal yung friendship namin.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/168qqmz/virgin_in_all_ways_pero_sexually_attracted_sa/,t2_dxto02p7k,1693726828.0,2
My female coworker almost often say sexual jokes to me,"I (23F/pansexual) and my coworker (21F/pansexual), we started as trainees. Our training in our new job and company started last year in September. We became close to each other January this year. She's kind and caring. Friendly enough to pull me to accompany her sometimes whenever she wants my company and she will do something. It's just weird to me that even though she's pansexual and more attracted to men, she threw a sexual joke to me such as:

""Compared your body to me, I can do you using my one hand only."" - refers to stimulating me

""Where do you wanna go after we go to Alkimia? I wanted to check-in. So boring if we will just go home after that. I want us to do something jk""

""Thank you. Smack or torrid? JK HAHAHAHA"" - when I handed her my wet wipes for her to use as a cover to her boil that popped during our working hours

""I'll do my best on bed."" - when I let her borrow my money

I guess, here are all of her jokes (?). I hardly remember if there are more jokes she threw to me the previous months other than those that I have shared. It just confuses me if that is just a joke or whatnot because I have a girlfriend since 2020 and she knows that.

I hope you can help me. Thank you!

‚Ä¢ BTW, we sometimes go out like a friendly date something like that. I know she have done those too with her girl friends and guy friends and also, always takes pictures of them and posts on her Instagram stories just like what she's doing to me. I just find it weird that she threw jokes to me while she knows that I have a girlfriend.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/yfme62/my_female_coworker_almost_often_say_sexual_jokes/,t2_suh7yitc,1666958777.0,0

How to get sexual validation with/without hooking up,"""What a zero pussy does to a mf"" (WARNING, throwaway account and Cursed words ahead. Please read first to the end before judging or criticizing, might appreciate it more if you do that)

First of all, I wanna clarify na I did have sexual validation before with some of my exes. However that's long ago pa (years ago) and I'm tired playing with my hand and even avoided porns (stopped for years already due to the hidden agendas of some pornsite) for the sake of getting better. Kaso here's the thing, as much as I wanted to wank or masturbate, it's still no good within my end cause I'm still craving for that physical sht na I'm longing. It's my love language and I'm not gonna lie na cause of that I became desperate to fuck again, even want to settle in hook up culture or someone who could be my FuBu, FWB or whatever you call it since I do not have time to commit.

The problem is, no matter how much I tried (phr4r, omegle, you call it), I still can't find one where I could let it pass (or maybe I just lack options where I can find one). I wanna try dating applications or site kaso it cost too much info in a sense na I would be detectable by some of my peers (phone number or something). Conventionally, pogi naman ako at referred as high sex appeal daw, may personality  and respects boundaries.  I could commit to any women I want to kaso ayaw ko naman magmahal for that reason lng (even tho it contributes to attraction and such, I don't want to hurt someone).

So you must be wondering, why? Aside from my hormones acting up and having a high sex drive, I also want to consider this as an experience na somehow could be beneficial when I commit again in future. Don't get me wrong, my past intercourses are like matter of puppy love lng and I almost forgot what's the feeling already. It's like a course na iniwan ko and parang I long to learn it again in a different way.

If you guys have any suggestions, whether where you get your hook ups or such, might want give me some. However, I could still settle for another convenient way if may alam kayo paano ko masesettle 'tong urge ko without the use of artificial pleasures. I'm thinking of settling with sex workers kaso I feel like it's not worth of investment. Yes, I may be dumb right now to think that you'll get what you want for free pero I really want to fend this off selfish desire by what I could offer already, physically or mentally.

I build myself up to be a better human being, even learned how to fight off my insecurities and harness this sexual energy through meditation. Everyday, I tend to delay my gratification for better good. Kaso hindi ba't parang sumusobra na to the fact na sex is considered as healthy and necessity pa rin for a teenager like me? I want to call this as ""libog"" lang or what pero it's different e, I'm acting on my main head rn and hindi sa baba. Where my brains tell me to get experience and pursue something you wanted to do already. Medyo naguguluhan na ako tbh so if you could give some clarity and help, I would appreciate it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/xlplid/how_to_get_sexual_validation_withwithout_hooking/,t2_sos16t26,1663914317.0,2

I wish I could have a normal sexual relationship for once.,"I‚Äôm now married but there‚Äôs the same problem that‚Äôs been poisoning my life for many years since I started dating and then living with girlfriends. Constant headache because I did this and that wrong (trying to create arguments about the most insignificant of things like hanging the clothes in the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù way), very infrequent and passionless sex, her never initiating sex and most of the time refusing when I want to have it, even no affection- taking my hand whenever I touch her body or try to pull her closer. 
And I‚Äôm not even talking about a specific woman - yes, my wife is like that with me, but more importantly, it‚Äôs a pattern. Every girl I‚Äôve ever dated became like this eventually.

I keep hearing all these guy online saying that their gfs and wives dress sexy for them, try to seduce them, etc. and I just fell like I‚Äôm untouchable. 
Meanwhile, I do my part- financially, emotionally, taking care of the household, etc. We contribute together to a family budget and it‚Äôs not like she‚Äôs using me for my money or something like that. We don‚Äôt have any kids, we‚Äôre young and our jobs are not that stressful. But there‚Äôs just no sexual tension at all.
I think that the problem is in me - I‚Äôm either unattractive or cannot build that sexual desire in women no matter how hard I try. I‚Äôm not a ‚Äúnice guy‚Äù that women can walk all over, but I‚Äôm not a charming Casanova either.

"As a Person Living With HIV, it's quite alarming and saddening how a lot of people are STILL UNEDUCATED about HIV and sexual health in general.","Someone posted about being sad, upset, and betrayed because of their boyfriend confessing that he is a PLHIV for the past 7 years of their relationship. for reference, here's the link:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/18izx2e/my\_bf\_is\_plhiv/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/18izx2e/my_bf_is_plhiv/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

To be fair, this is an issue of trust, communication, and education. 

The title is what i felt in general after seeing the comments section of the post. AS A FELLOW PLHIV, HERE ARE SOME FACTS AS WELL AS MY TAKES FOR THE DISCRIMINATORY PEOPLE IN THE COMMENTS SECTION OF THE POST, SO READ UP:

1. What OP felt was valid. Sad, worried, upset? Okay, fine, considering that you STILL NOT EDUCATED. Betrayed? Yes, I can say that it is DEFINITELY your right to know this as his LONG TERM PARTNER and decide based on the given info. BUT, TAKE NOTE, it is also your RESPONSIBILITY to EDUCATE yourself about HIV and Sexual health, and if someone still feels the same disgust and fear after reading up about HIV and Undetectable status, well I am utterly disappointed. It is either they are really stupid (sorry, but really) or downright discriminatory. Kudos to OP for educating himself! 
2. This is not all about you. Ikaw ba may HIV? Do you think he wanted and wished to have HIV? Did you even think about how hard it was for the PLHIV to disclose their status to judgmental, discriminatory, and uneducated people? You guys know why A LOT OF PLHIVs cannot disclose their status even to their closest family members? Yes, because of lack of education and understanding of people about this condition. Because more PLHIVs die of s\*icide and mental health problems rather than HIV, brought about by discrimination.
3. UNDETECTABLE = UNTRASMITTABLE. Kudos to OP's Partner for TAKING HIS MEDS RELIGIOUSLY OVER THE PAST 7 YEARS and attaining the undetectable status. Consistent medication can result to undetectable status as soon as 1-3 months with the latest available drug in the Philippines. And these meds are FREE.
4. OP felt betrayed, yes definitely, but this also reflects something about the dynamics of communication, education, and trust within their relationship. 
5. TAKE NOTE: BF cared and loved OP enough to take care of himself so he won't be able to pass on the virus. He just did not have the courage to tell. You know the difference between caring and not caring? My previous partner knew about his status, decided not to take any meds, and didn't care about whoever he might infect. That is not caring.  That is how I got infected. OP is HIV negative, congrats! Your partner cared enough about you. 
6. Some people even want the PLHIV to be jailed. WOW. Much wow. Please read up RA11166, mga attorney.

I was also in the same shoes as OP's BF before but this is what I did:

1. Assessed my partner's knowledge about HIV, casually, without disclosing my status yet. 
2. Educated him and filled in the gaps of the knowledge that he lacks. 
3. Told him about my status. 
4. He accepted me because he now understood everything about my condition, and how he will be safe. Currently in an exclusive serodiscordant relationship with him for almost three years already, enjoying unprotected sex. What's there to protect if we're exclusive, I'm undetectable, and we don;t have other STDs?

If you people want to educate yourself more about HIV, Undetectable = untransmittable, and HIV medication, go visit the pages of the organizations, do your research, and READ. Google is also free.

"It's okay to have sexual preferences, just accept that not everyone will prefer you too.","In the age of hookups, vanity is king. Marami dito, ang hanap is the typical:

Ako naman, I have my preferences rin. Di naman masama, Di ba?

[TRIGGER WARNING: R & SH] I WAS RAPED AND SEXUALLY HARASSED AND MY FRIEND TOLD ME BAKA DAW ‚ÄúNOT IN THE MOOD‚Äù LANG AKO,"Potangina. Since I was just around I think 12-ish or 13 up until 15, I was raped by my friend‚Äôs brother. It became a cycle and I never thought I was raped until I was 18. It‚Äôs when I started to realize na I was raped talaga because I was a minor and he used my vulnerability as a gay teen to manipulate me, and even today I can still remember na it was him who made me watch porn for the very first time and I even asked if totoo yun and sabi nya oo and so everytime he let me watch porn, he would do exactly the same to me sa video na he made me watch. Every time I get penetrated I feel so empty and frozen that time, speaking up or never coming back sa bahay ng friend ko was never an option to me before, that feeling na I was really hypnotized. Now I am 20 already, and last January 11, I had a drink with my fellow SK kagawads at the house of our colleague, and his brother sexually harassed me, I can still feel how he dampi his mouth at the back of my neck and would signal me with sexual hand signs discreetly. That incident triggered and freshened everything that had happened to me when I was regularly raped. I tried to open up to my fellow gay friend about it and he said baka not in the mood daw ako, I feel like I was stabbed and silenced. Ang hirap maging bading tapos ma sexually harassed ka and rape because people will not believe in you because of the stereotypes that has labeled gay persons to be.

Daughter is a victim of sexual assault. Relatives think we deserve it.,"Long story short, we are battling a case against my bro-in-law. My family decided to support my sister and save him instead. They turned their backs on us.. Mas pinili nilang kampihan ang demonyo. They didn't believed us, they didn't believed my daughter.

We are staying at a friend's place now but she told me that we need to leave within the week. I tried asking help from my other friends but to no avail. So I asked help from relatives today if they can let us in or if they can lend us some money. And I will just pay for it once I got back on my knees. Apparently my mom didn't tell them what happened, so I told them the truth. Akala ko maniniwala sila sakin/samin, akala ko maintindihan nila bakit hindi ako nanahimik sa nangyari sa anak ko. But to my disbelief, my uncle and other relatives said that it's probably because I don't go to church anymore (kilalang church ito.) And malamang daw nagalit sa akin ang Ama. At yung nangyari sa daughter ko eh karma ko at dahil hindi kasi siya handog. Samantalang yung demonyong gumawa nun sa anak ko eh member din sa church na yun! Grabe! Hindi ko lubos maisip papano nila nasabi yun. My daughter doesn't deserve what happened to her, no one deserves that. Ang sakit sa dibdib na marinig 'to sa mga ka-pamilya ko. I couldn't believe that they would think that we deserve what's happening to us just because.. Okay na sana yung sabihin nila na hindi sila makakatulong, why would they even say such thing.

I'm a guy and I hate being sexually objectified,"Maybe controversial, kasi if lalaki ka dapat lagi sex nasa utak mo. Na if offered sex, you'd pursue it in a heartbeat. Pero this is the third girl this year that hit on me, and after conversation ... Sex lang na naman habol sakin [M22 btw]? I'm pretending to be offline right now. I just want space. Sex is great yeah, hindi ako virgin. I had sexual partners before. Pleasureable? Absolutely. Bragging rights na may FWB or mataas body count mo? Hell yeah. 

Pero honestly I really don't like how I (and our society) treat sex as a commodity dito sa hookup culture, and I'm not even a religious person (anymore at least). Nakaka badtrip lang. I'm way happier hanging out with my friends. I'm happy reading academic journals (university student here), cooking and solving puzzles. I hate how our society puts too much praise sa mga lalaking rich ang sex life. It's like an over-glorified trophy na alpha male ka daw wow, pero para saan naman? Does it make you happy? I'm not sure about others pero it definitely doesn't make me happy at all. It's like candy; masarap but doesn't complete you. It's like phone overusage. Or gaming addiction. I feel disgusted with myself na I'm numbing my senses with the pursuit of something that I don't like, or something I only pursued kasi I'm enslaved to my fleeting emotions.

I'm just really curious kung may pumapatol sa mga ganun ~~and why~~? Loljk. Wala lang, it feels so empty for me.

I was sexually assaulted and psychologically abused,"This happened three years ago. My(22F) ex(22M) was generally nice to everyone, he was a gentleman and was protective of me but I realized that it was only when he gets what he wants. One time he forcefully penetrated me even when I begged him multiple times not to and also told him to stop because it physically hurts. He got annoyed at me and told me pa-victim daw ako. He then tried to haggle and compromise by saying hell waiting for me to say no three times before he'd stop. I kept telling him no means no. But whenever I say no, he would give me the silent treatment or throw stuff around until I complied. After that, he'd act nice again.  He also kept secretly removing the condom in the middle of sex whenever I tell him that I'll only do it if we had contraception. He also kept bragging to his friends that he and I were having sex, even if I told him I wasn't okay with people knowing about it. Whenever I tried to leave the relationship, he'd threaten to jump off his condo. He'd send me pictures of his leg situated on top of the railings, he would threaten me that he'll spread intimate pictures he took of me in secret, he'd throw tantrums in public by yelling, hurting himself, or walking out. Back when we were friends, I opened up about losing a childhood friend to suicide and I feel like he scared me on purpose to prevent our break up.  I finally had the guts to break up with him after being pushed to my breaking point and because I moved to the province and am now super far from him plus he doesn't know my new address. I still get flashbacks of these events in the middle of doing chores, in the middle of online class or when I'm studying and its really fucking me up. I try to stay strong especially for my current boyfriend (23M), he's helped me work through this and listened to me speak about it a lot of times but I can tell that its making him sad hearing what I went through, he isn't supposed to be a therapist after all. My boyfriend says I was violated and couldn't have consented but its still hard for me to consider this. I  wanted to tell my parents but I know they would end up blaming me instead for being too stupid.  I know I didn't consent to most of it but I did let myself suffer in silence. Sometimes I feel like I deserve this because I wasn't careful enough in choosing a partner. I still struggle with the idea that I had no control over the situation when I know I could've left had I been smarter and been stronger mentally. It still makes me feel suicidal after all these years. I still feel unclean. I feel like a burden to those who I love that know what I went through because I keep crying about it and remembering it. I want to get therapy but I don't want my parents to find out, but I also don't want someone to hear it while knowing who I am. Its something I'm really ashamed about.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/ti4wdg/i_was_sexually_assaulted_and_psychologically/,t2_5wlcfxxu,1647724030.0,5
I'm mad that I can't report my cousin who sexually abuse,"I was sexually by my cousin at age ten whenever he is stays at our house. I kept it as a secret cause I was ignorant and naive but made terms to tell my mom when I was 17 years old resulting him my cousin banned from our house. 

I became vocal about it in social media especially on my tiktok and facebook ever since I learned there are other victims. 

I always wanted to report him but I'm worried I will be shunned by my whole extended family since we are a tight knit family. I love my province and that's where I go and I consider it a safe place but if I report him to the police I feel I would no longer be welcome.

Another reason is, my own mother is against it. My sister, a victim herself is against it since the stress is not worth it daw. My dad was against on my tiktok posts abt SA awareness. 

Another is, his family would lose income since he the breadwinner of the family. He is a seafarer.

For now, ang agreement namin ipa doctor siya kaso since seafarer nga siya di yun tuloy. I tried contacting the wife if he received cosistent theraphy or consultation while he is still here sa Philippines, she kept it vague.

Sexually Assaulted by my HS pastor. Kept my mouth shut for years but I can't keep quiet anymore,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons

TW: Sexual Abuse

Its been years and I still can't get over it... I used to be a firm believer of God but now I'm just lost.

It all started when I joined this KOSH (Knights of the Sacred Heart) group back in my Highschool (Paranaque Area). I've always volunteered to serve during masses in my childhood so I thought this was a good idea. The head of the organization, we'll call Mr. BS, was kind to all of us members and even encouraged us to do bible studies and reaching out to him when we had problems but I heard he was bipolar since his mood would change drastically and no one is perfect, only God is, but the worst part was yet to come. 

One random day I was alerted by my fellow server that Mr. BS has been secretly filming us on our changing room and he keeps it all on his iPad because he accidentally left his macbook unattended in one of his classes and one of my batch mates were able to get a glimpse of what he had open that time and he saw me, in my underwear, getting ready for the previous service. What kind of sick f\*ck watches that in the middle of a classroom??

Every time we did something wrong during service our leader, Mr. BS (FYI the guy was like in his late twenties) would punish us SEVERELY. The worst I could remember was him forcing one of the other servers (15 y/o boy) to masturbate in front of him while we all stood there and watched him cry simply because he screwed up something so minor that I already forgot what it was about. 

We knew we had to report him and WE DID!!! WE TRIED EVERYTHING but the school principal kept sweeping it under the rug and apparently, we weren't the only ones who came first since there were also previous batches who reported him YEARS AGO!! 

We tried to escalate this to our local barangay and they rushed the school but one of the sisters, we'll call her sister G. was defending this pedophile pleading to the barangay officials that it was all a misunderstanding (at this point in time we had PROOF, videos and pictures) and we just wanted Mr. Brian to get arrested. 

What pisses me off is that he didn't. Nothing, no punishment whatsoever... Sure, he was let go of his job but he's still walking free out there (last I heard he was in a different country) and it haunts me that he might be victimizing countless others.

God! I have been nothing buy loyal to you!! I have been nothing but faithful to you! I have tried and tried again to forgive this person for what he did to me and my fellow brothers but WHY WOULD YOU LET HIM WALK FREE WHILE WE STILL CARRY THE TRAUMAS OF HIS ACTION??

WHY DID YOU DEFEND HER SISTER GRACE? WHY WOULD YOU DEFEND A PEDOPHILE WHEN WE HAD THE PROOF THAT IT WASN'T A MISUNDERSTANDING!!!

Why did the principal just let him walk free? Why...

I'm starting to lose hope, I'm starting to believe that my whole religion is just a sham... I'm starting to think that every sister in Sacred Heart is just a f\*cking hypocrite most especially you sister G. 

If God was real, why would he let sinners like Mr. BS walk free? Why... ",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/14wqgfc/sexually_assaulted_by_my_hs_pastor_kept_my_mouth/,t2_f8seem8td,1689079668.0,2
I'm thinking about cheating on my longterm boyfriend with a random dude I have a sexual infatuation over.,"I don't even know what I'm doing so going on reddit is surely the best idea.
I've (23f) been in a relationship with my boyfriend for almost three years. I absolutely love and adore him and I can't imagine spending my life with anyone else. However sexually speaking we are not that compatible, I like to have rather rough sex and my boyfriend doesn't. We've talked about it multiple times but he just doesn't like to become violent in bed, which is fine, I don't want to force him to do anything he doesn't want. Now I've been out with a few people from my university, amongst them a guy who started flirting with me. My boyfriend doesn't mind me flirting with other guys because he knows it's harmless. However this guy, let's call him B. just really gets in my head. Like I know he's exactly the kind of guy I'd have great sex with. It's the first time in my life where I met someone I'd just want to fuck and I don't know what to do about it. I don't want to jeopardize my relationship but at the same time I can't stop about going over to B. And let him do what he wants to me. And I feel super guilty about getting myself in such a situation in the first place. So reddit my question is: does the longing and fantasizing stop? Is there a way to stop fantasizing about someone?",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/th4wfl/im_thinking_about_cheating_on_my_longterm/,t2_dk43igax,1647619795.0,0
My sexual harasser is thriving in the new neighborhood I live in and I want to expose him,"First off, we're both men.

I live in a new subdivision. Middle class.

Before we came here may FB group and group chat for upcoming residents. Met this dude who was interested in me and my bf, e me and my hubby sleeps with other men for fun sometimes, so we tried to arrange something for when we both live in the area.

Later on I found out that he has a longtime partner. So I asked, so will you bring your bf? He said, no this is a secret. Please don't tell that I do this on the side.

I got disgusted and mentally noted not the have sex with him because I hate cheating. Didn't tell him that tho but I stopped flirting on chat.

Fast forward to now we both live in the subdv. He said he will visit our house. I said I'm busy and my bf was away (he was at a gig). He insisted. To be polite I said sure. He hung out for a bit while I was working (my shift was on so I didn't want to entertain him fully) but we had convo. When he was about to leave, he slapped my ass. I was shocked, almost punched him. He said sorry.

That's when my bf and I stopped communicating with him. 

Now back to the group chat and the community. The dude who sexually harassed me has been slowly campaigning to be head of HOA. Sobrang PR nya. Nagpapainom. Buys drinks for midnight sessions. Now everyone (not me and my bf) calls him chairman.

Also somehow I feel ostracized in the group and the community. My posts get ignored for example. I feel like he badmouths me and my bf to his friends in the community.

I don't know what to do. I don't want to expose him but I just feel triggered whenever I see his posts and his success, I guess? What will happen to me in this community, in my dream house, if he succeeds in ostracizing us?",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/10o3o09/my_sexual_harasser_is_thriving_in_the_new/,t2_bdg6u,1674983956.0,3
"I was sexually abused, not once. not twice. But as I grew up.","Nangyari to when I was in elementary, 2nd grade as I recall. The eldest boy among my classmates used to touch me in my legs and thighs in a very disturbing manner. back then I thought na kinikiliti lang ako, kasi that's what my innocent mind knows. But he repeated it almost everyday until I feel uncomfortable, but at the same time I was convinced na it was harmless and he can do it anytime he wants and he even did it to different girls in our class. Until one day one of us stood up and nagsumbong sa class adviser namin. I remember my self shocked and scared kasi he did it to me everyday for a very long time and I didn't have any idea that it was wrong. I started crying as our teacher asked each one of us kung sino pa yung ginagawan niya ng ganon, I remember the feeling of shame at that age kasi we were asked sa harap ng buong class I still remember yung mga tingin. We are in a private catholic school, where nuns run the school. I remember my teacher asking 6 of us girls who he touched. The set up is 6 of us girls ‚Äî our teacher ‚Äî the young offender ‚Äî and one of the sisters in our school. There's no Parents present in that conversation. We we're asked sa harap din mismo ng offender namin, we we're overwhelmed by the situation, we were just kids na dapat naglalaro lang at nag aaral.  I remember na since then I can't look at that boy the same anymore, the conversation ends with an apology. Just a piece of apology. whole elementary days ko naging ilag ako sa lalaking yun and being in a small, private catholic school means you'll having the same class with your classmates for years.  I thought our parents are already notified about the incident and it's already taken care of kasi no one talks about it anymore, but no. I remember myself na umiiwas sa mga lalaki. As the years goes by I forced myself to forget how horrible it feels like. but I think that incident wake something in me. Something I can't control as I grew up. Until recently I remembered the same exact feeling. I wasn't good for days and madalas tulala lang ako. I decided to tell my mother about it, she cried as if she failed to protect me. She know nothing about it, the school tried their best to hide it well. She know nothing how hard is it for me that time and she feels bad about it.

Growing up, maaga nagmature body ko, I was scared sa mga changes. I saw my breast perked up. My hips get wider and my waist are getting curvier. I always looked 2-4 years older than my age. I remember a lot of time na nacacatcall ako kahit nasa early years palang ako ng Junior Highschool years ko. It's very disturbing. I was always afraid of guys looking my legs, and back of my thighs everytime I walked pass through them. That's why everytime I go out, my clothes are always have sleeves or bigger sizes, or long sleeves and hoodies, my pants will always be long and shorts will be always just above the knees. But then again, I was abused.

I was raped when I was 15. It's my first. He's my first boyfriend and he's 19 that time. I thought it was love but as I think of it now, it was full manipulation. I was emotionally unstable when we met kasi my father just passed away that time and I felt unsafe, abandoned and alone. He preyed on me. I was young and given a huge responsibility on my shoulder. I can't bear with it. I needed some support and someone who can help me to get through it. The first month is pure and sweet but one day I got out of school early so sa kanila ako dumiretso. Pag punta ko, nag iinuman pala silang magpipinsan, puro lalaki, kasama mga kapatid niya, I had few drinks until I feel tipsy. He tricked me and he hold on tight sa waist ko and he said sa mga pinsan niya ""akyat daw siya nahihilo siya eh"" I never said anything I even tried to say na ayos lang ako pero hinigpitan niya lalo yung kapit niya sa bewang ko, kaya sumama ako. I was intoxicated when he did it, I repeatedly say no pero mas malakas siya sakin. wala akong nagawa. It was my first and It happened that way. I know what actually happened kaya I asked him ""mahal mo naman ako diba?"" as if I was asking for assurance na he won't leave me. but he never answered, and I go home all by myself with the thought na baka mabuntis ako at panliliit sa sarili ko kasi hindi ko nakuha yung sagot na gusto kong marinig habang siya nakuha yung virginity ko sa ganong paraan. the very next day he blocked me and left me as if para akong gamit. I still remember one of his cousins na binastos pa ako after what happened, hindi niya lang ako nirape, niyabang niya pa sa buong angkan niya na nakuha niya ako. No one understood the pain and no one knows that it happened. I dealt it on my own. 

I kept it for a year and a half but my life begins to be bumpy and I was alcoholic and uncontrollable. it even gets to the point that my own younger brother beat me up when we fight (verbally) coz he thought I don't have any authority, he doesn't even respect me, he'll punch me in the head, stomach and inuuntog niya ako sa pader at hagdan, this continued until I had my second relationship He's 23 and I'm 16. I never felt safe for a long time until he arrived in my life but then saglit lang kasi he's cheating behind my back for 4 times, I'll forgive him and he's back at it again and again. He's the worst one. He used me for his own good. We had sex. A lot. I mean a lot, and he always refuse to wear condoms and having the thought na he cheated on me makes me sick of myself and hate myself more. Akala ko I found someone na poprotekta sakin, akala ko na finally may  masasandalan na ako but he end up confessing that he's only using me for his financial needs. at sa huli mag isa nanaman ako di ko alam saan ko nanaman pupulutin sarili ko.

I've been single for a year again and here comes the last relationship I had. I'm 17 and he's 21. He knows these things about me kasi I've been brave to share it with him and trust my life to him but cheating was never new to him also. I still remember an Intimate moment when I beg like ""if ayaw mo na sakin, sabihin mo nalang. Kasi pag naghiwalay tayo ayaw kong matandaan na niloko mo pa ako kasi mahal na mahal kita"". A month after that he cheated on me for the first time.  And the second time was so much painful na up to this day nahirapan na ako magtiwala. We broke up and at the very next day, his ex and him are together. 

It was so devastating to look back into these past relationships I had and abuses that I dealt on my own. I am just finding someone I can trust, someone who can be my family, and someone I can be with until the end. I never share this para kaawaan ako or to beg love and empathy from everyone, I share this to remind all of you how to be gentle and how to be kind to everyone. How to be strong and how to keep on going. Only God knows how hard it is. How it feels like a trash being thrown around after every use. 

As I turn 19, and to the next years I'm having, these things got me reminded that I will no longer find any man to fill every void na mas lalo lang lumalaki everytime I believe. I hope for the better days. And I hope to learn how I forgive and forget this things.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/w27jmh/i_was_sexually_abused_not_once_not_twice_but_as_i/,t2_q6lfuwl0,1658171593.0,56
"Today, I realized that I don't wanna be in a romantic/sexual relationship.","I don't know if it's just because I haven't slept yet + nagkape pa ako kaya ganito yung mga naiisip ko pero here it goes...

Gaya nga ng nabanggit ko sa title, ayaw ko pumasok sa ganyang intimate relationship even though naging desperada akong magkajowa ngayong taon (ONE TIME LANG. I didn't even act on it. LMAO). Haha. Naisip ko lang na ayaw ko na may responsibility ako sa emotions and well-being ng ibang tao. I mean, yeah, same can be said sa other kinds of relationships din pero I just can't be bothered with the responsibilities talaga. Iba na kasi to eh.

O baka kasi hindi ko pa naranasan kaya I'm a bit reluctant pero when I actually thought about it, I'm easily drained‚Äîmentally, physically, and emotionally. Kaya di ko talaga nakikita yung sarili na maglalaan pa ng time and energy sa iba when I'm already that exhausted. And I'm sorry if this sounds narcissistic pero wala akong interes pa sa mga taong nasa paligid ko. At least, not in a romantic or sexual way.

Tanong lang, has anybody felt the same way as I did? How are you doing? I grew up with an environment that kept reminding us that we must build our own family eventually but... no. I don't want to entertain that idea, at least, for now.

It's sad how people want promiscuity to be normalized,"First, this is not about being close-minded, misogynistic, and slut-shaming. This is about increasing awareness of how hookup culture is detrimental to both genders, physically and mentally.

Promiscuity should not be celebrated or encouraged as 'empowering'. I see many people think that having high numbers of sexual partners don't matter. Here in the Philippines, it's becoming normalized. For both men and women, it matters when they have many sexual partners because hookup culture has many consequences such as STDs, unplanned pregnancies, detrimental to mental health ([depression, less satisfaction in relationships](https://psiloveyou.xyz/what-happens-to-your-brain-after-having-too-much-casual-sex-41a206c7f303), [sexual detachment](https://www.google.com/amp/s/m.femina.in/relationships/love-sex/the-downside-of-hookup-culture-why-you-might-be-sad-or-confused-210160.amp), [sexual compulsiveness](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/182473#causes), etc.). Also, it's really dangerous (Stealthing, hidden camera, rape, stalkers and false accusations) you can't just trust a stranger you just met one night.

The sexually liberated people say that everyone can have sex as much as they want. They just need to know how to have safe sex and consent but they overlook the possible consequences of hookup culture mentally. Learn to be emotionally intelligent too. We see many posts on r/alasjuicy and r/offmychestph where promiscuous people miss having hoe phase while they‚Äôre in committed relationship, catching feelings on their casual sex partner and tried non monogamous sexual fantasy and now they feel confused and depressed. No matter what a sexually liberated person says, sex usually has mental effects on the people who have it. Oxytocin (love hormone) is released into the brain during sex. Without teaching them emotional intelligence, people who engage in a lot of hookups will suffer as a result. Stop promoting the idea that sex isn't a big deal. It is crucial. If you aren't accountable and mature, it has serious implications. Most people aren't as responsible, serious, or emotionally aware as they believe they are.

Sexual freedom and empowerment do not imply engaging in several hookups only because Westerners do it. Selecting what you want to do without lowering your standards or risking your physical or mental health is what gives you freedom. The real empowerment comes from not conforming questionable propaganda they want to normalized.

In general, people lack the vision or insight to consider issues from a wider perspective. This is a great case; they enjoy having sex, but they are unable to recognize how the hookup culture is detrimental to society.

Respect promiscuous people but DO NOT glamorize and normalize the sex life they have.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/xrb4ea/its_sad_how_people_want_promiscuity_to_be/,t2_s4vj924s,1664466204.0,589

"my bestfriends bf, a rlly close friend of mine, sexually assaulted me last night while we slept in the same room.","for some super quick context, im in a very close friend group with eight ppl, we‚Äôve been close since age fifteen and are now all twenty.

youll just need to know myself and my partner ‚Äòted‚Äô, and my best friend ‚Äòamy‚Äô who‚Äôs dating ‚Äòdarren‚Äô. both couples have been together around 2 years at this point.  

and even tho this is already long, i think it‚Äôs necessary to mention just how much i love amy, she does anything she ever can for me and the love we have for each other is like nothing i‚Äôve heard before, we understand each other so well and the idea of losing her over this kills me over and over. 

i stayed over at her house, heading over abt 11pm last night. me her and darren hang out until around 2am when amy falls asleep. meanwhile, darren and i spend the next 5 hours laying together on the spare mattress they keep for when i stay. to be clear this is super normal, again we‚Äôre a really close group and doing something like laying together in almost any way is something we‚Äôre all so used to, having grown up together and stuff. we talk abt old candy we liked, the egg theory, fifa, a bunch of random shit. and we‚Äôre close and he hugs me sometiems, and it‚Äôs so nice. darren always gives me really great hugs and ive always appreciated them even when i don‚Äôt usually like hugs at all. he made me feel safe and listened to, the best friend anyone could imagine. 

eventually we fall asleep for a couple hours, 3 maybe, and then i‚Äôm awake and we‚Äôre laying together and hugging again. NOTHING we wouldn‚Äôt usually do nothing anyone would ever be upset over seeing. he slowly starts to gently move his hands around until something changes and he‚Äôs just touching me. i‚Äôm somewhat asexual and he knows this, it‚Äôs something i‚Äôm open about- there‚Äôs a lot to it but bc of past experiences like this, the fact i‚Äôm just not into sexual stuff.. either way he knows but continues. i‚Äôm paralysed for a while, this has happened before. in that moment i felt so so scared again and told myself the same thing i did then, ‚Äòjust close ur eyes and try to enjoy it, it‚Äôs normal and fun and what teenagers do, it‚Äôs not a big deal‚Äô. but since then i‚Äôve gotten more used to it, since getting with ted. and so i just went on autopilot like how i usually have to with my boyfriend when i‚Äôm not feeling it. like i‚Äôve told darren and amy about before, it‚Äôs not like i‚Äôm never into it, but i can‚Äôt exactly tell even my partner to stop. 

the best i could do was try and sleep again, which i tried, or tell him to think abt what was happening and eventually i just kept hoping amy would wake up. the thing is i didn‚Äôt react like anything was wrong, like the last time i felt so bad and so responsible, i didn‚Äôt want to make darren think he‚Äôd something wrong, which he had. all i thought was that it was my fault and so sudden and that id kept him awake all night talking, so it was fair? i felt so guilty. he also had a driving test that morning and i felt if i showed any sign of how horrible i felt it might stress him out. 

i spent the rest of the day spaced out hanging with amy, not talking much but we‚Äôre used to sitting in what‚Äôs usually a comfortable silence for us both together. i keep asking myself over and over if i made it up for attention if i dreamt it maybe, convincing myself i started it but i don‚Äôt think i ever could have. i don‚Äôt feel real and i‚Äôm so sick of this guilt already. i just don‚Äôt understand why it happened, we‚Äôve been like brothers since we met, we love each others partners so so much. i feel so so stuck and so responsible",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/10m7iau/my_bestfriends_bf_a_rlly_close_friend_of_mine/,t2_97u3tztg,1674780067.0,4
"Dear closeted gay/bisexual men, stop using women to cover up your sexuality because you feel confused, ashamed or guilty of your identity","Happy pride month everybody! üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà

This is a story of my friend's sexual exploit of two guys cheating on their girlfriends. I asked for consent if I could post this on Reddit, he said yes, and then proceeded to ask me what the hell is Reddit. Pero he still said yes naman after the explanation. üíÄ

Nothing is wrong with your gender identity and sexual preference. Everything is wrong when you use other people to cover it up due to your perceived guilt or shame.

I had a tita's night out with my girl and gay besties last night. We had drinks, food, and, our favorite, tea and coffee to spill.

One of my gay friends, who is currently single, told us about his recent sexual exploit for last week. Apparently, he was invited into a threesome by a Grindr user who identified as bisexual (based on his profile); said threeway would be done with his friend daw. The guys were actually standard issue thirst trap for gays, so pumayag siya sa invitation.

When they met up daw, they started doing the deed. After the act, saka sila nagka-usapan. My friend asked if the two of them were regular FWBs or dating. They said regular FWBs daw.

They also disclosed that they were currently romantically involved with other people. Basically meron daw silang kanya-kanyang jowa. So my friend inquired more of this. He asked if these people know about their threesome arrangement, kasi kung with consent naman itong ginawa nila then it's technically not really cheating (give the benefit of the doubt, baka kasi open relationship pala).

No daw.

Friend asked why.

Sabi nila kasi they would get mad...because they were mother. fucking. **WOMEN. GIRLFRIENDS.**

Friend told me that he was shocked to have heard of this. Kaloka daw kasi parang feeling niya ginamit siya. Pangalawa, he just unwittingly intruded into a relationship that he should have never been a part of.

Friend asked how they identified their sexual preference.

Sabi ng both guys na they were straight. They just like having sex with other men for fun. But nothing romantic from their sexual encounters.

Kami naman ng friends ko, we don't mind how other people label their sexualities. If di sila comfy gamitin yung SOGIE terms, then it's really fine. Kaso iba naman yung niloloko niyo yung mga gf/asawa niyo.

Kaputanginahan na yan.

After they parted ways, they asked friend if this would be a regular set-up daw, to have threesomes every week, kasi they both liked my friend din (who is also a standard issue thirst trap for gays, pero with a heart of gold and a smart brain, kaso minsan bobita kapag malibog na). Sabi na lang niya, he'll update them, pero he plans on ghosting them and blocking them. If hew knew prior, he would never be involved in that shit stain of a situation daw. I believe him kasi we all condemn cheating in relationships, no matter the cause or justification.

Sabi ko na lang kay bakling na next time kasi, mag rapport at expectation setting muna sila ng mga future kameet up niya, at hindi meet and breed kaagad.

So ayun lang, mga akling.

Putang ina ng mga taong ganyan. Kukuha kayo ng girlfriend to cover up your secret sexual desires. You go behind your significant other's backs to scratch an itch that your partner can't satisfy for you.

You don't use other people for your own character development. Instead, you can find other sources in your community or through the internet in resolving your sexuality conflict; this is also a part of mental health concerns that are valid and needed to be addressed. You don't have to label yourself if the word *gay, bisexual, pansexual* or whatever term leaves a bad taste in your mouth. All I ask is to not involve using our female sisters as meat shields from your toxic self-perceived guilt. There are healthier ways to overcome these feelings. Cheating is not one of them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/v9kwtf/dear_closeted_gaybisexual_men_stop_using_women_to/,t2_13bu98,1654904978.0,71
I think I was sexually abuse when I was a child,"I often have vague memories of being with some relatives of mine that I dont remember the name and face na, nasa cr kami and he was showing me his dick and I remember getting upclose to it he was bragging about the bolitas in his dick. But im not sure if hanggang dun lng cant remember anything else that happened.

Goodbye Pornography,"I'm really happy that I managed to delete all the porn videos I had downloaded and saved on my phone, as well as on my two Telegram accounts where I had joined numerous porn channels and paid subscription channels. It's amazing how I was able to free up almost 50% of the 128 GB memory on my phone. Haha! Over the years, I've been watching porn on every platform I could find, but now I've made the decision to put an end to it. I've come to realize that there's so much more to life that truly matters, and I need to eliminate these distractions so I can focus on my career and personal growth. Besides, it was negatively impacting my sexual satisfaction and performance during real sexual experiences. I really hope I can resist the temptation to watch porn again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/13s1uy1/goodbye_pornography/,t2_puxx1t0f,1685071371.0,442

my dad made a sexual comment and i feel very uncomfortable in our house,"I usually am a very carefree and confident person. My friends described me as very ""apakan mo ko"" vibes. But I feel uncomfortable in my own skin right now. 

My dad and I went to the grocery early June ata, basta during GCQ. When I was unloading the groceries and putting it on the counter to pay for it, my dad stopped kasi ""nasesexyhan ako sayo"". And that really made a mark sa akin.

So I was wearing shorts then pero very boyish na nga getup ko nun kasi androgynous dapat peg ko. Regarding how I move, very poised kasi ako kumilos. Ako yung tipong nakataas lagi yung pinky pag may ginagawa, or straight yung posture pag lumalakad. Ewan ko, feeling ko kasi model ako or part ng royalty pag naglalakad.

Ang weird lang talaga na masabihan ako nun ng dad ko. It made me so uncomfortable and I told him about that. He tried to explain, the way dads do--by gaslighting me na wala naman siyang sinabing ganun, ako lang nag-iisip nun tapos galit na boses niya. Sobrang uncomfortable ko na pag nasa bahay ako, hindi ako tumatabi sa kanya na or nakalean forward ako para di bakat boobs. Di na ako nagsusuot ng sleeveless or thin clothing or shorts sa bahay. Di na rin ako makapagyoga kasi baka bigla siyang pumasok or what. I've become so hyper aware of everything, eh it's not something I usually do.

So far my dad hasn't made any comments like that pa ulit. But he has made comments about my weight kasi I've gained around 10kgs compared to March. Pero I guess I've cared less about my weight compared to dati na conscious ako about my shape. I now want to look as unattractive as possible. Para no more comments like that na talaga. 

I will discuss this with my psych soon tho. I really hope na matapos na yung pandemic kasi di ko na talaga kaya sa bahay. I feel very very uncomfortable na talaga sa bahay.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/if0a0s/my_dad_made_a_sexual_comment_and_i_feel_very/,t2_xf2n9,1598174508.0,7
24y/o Porn Addict,"Di ko na alam paano tutulungan sarili ko. Since HS up until now that I am currently working as a project engineer in a construction company, dala-dala ko pa rin 'tong pagkahumaling ko sa porn and masturbation. 

Akala ko nung adolescent years ko, maa-outgrow ko din 'tong phase na 'to kase common lang naman sa teenagers to discover sexuality. Kaso ngayon, I am still burdened by these sexual habits. 

Yes, aware ako na addiction na ito dahil nakakaapekto na sa well-being ko and parang incorporated na sya 'matic sa routine ko. Nagagawa ko sya minsan, 'pag wala akong kasama sa office. O kaya minsan 'matik na hahanapin ng katawan ko bago matulog. Minsan, I'll do it on public restrooms. May instances pa na magbabrowse lang ako sa socmed, matitrigger ako to do it. Sobrang lala na. Nakakapagod na din.

Lumaki ako sa simbahan, and I was trying to be open about it kaso failed. Nag-open na din ako closest friend para maging accountable ako to myself pero wala pa din. Nakakapanghina ng loob. 

Kung may pagkakataon lang na makabalik sa dati, di ko na hahayaang masanay ako sa porn. Ang hirap makawala.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/18tdbg1/24yo_porn_addict/,t2_q9x7uns4t,1703821276.0,182

Cried after watching the most intimate p0rn I've ever watched,"So ayon I was looking forward na makaraos tonight but turns out mamamatay na lang pala ako sa inggit. Imbes na matutulog nang nakaraos matutulog pala ako nang mugto ang mata HAHAHA. Jk. Nakakafrustrate na online ko nakilala nag trigger ng sexual awakening ko tuloy di ko alam ano gagawin ko lalo pa't mahina loob ko to do the real thing (pero I was looking forward na magawa namin yun considering na we were fond of each other for 5 years, but everything changed when the fire nation attacked).

Tamang nood na nga lang iniraraos ganto pa mangyayare HAHAHAHUHU.

me and my partner havent had sex in the last 5 years and there are just days when i just.. hate him for it,"i love him.. we've been together for a long time and he just lost his interest sexually bc ""ganun daw pag matagal na"" 

Ayaw ko rin ipilit kaya hinayaan ko nalang at kaya umabot kami sa ganto. Ramdam ko naman he loves me. It's just that we dont do it or make out. Mahirap as a person na love language and physical touch. 

Most of the days I don't mind... But there are just days when it feels heavy. And it's making me feel... hate? Idk. 

I wish i will stop feeling this way when i get older... :(

Iba pala talaga pag mahal mo talaga yung ka intimate moment mo no?,"Sobrang kinikilig ako I have to let this out sorry haha

Background info lang, I‚Äôve (M27) never ever been intimate with someone I‚Äôm truly in love with. Palagi lang with ONS or FWB, my first time included. So last year na karoon ako ng gf, and she‚Äôs so amazing, pretty, smart, basically everything one would want in a girl and I‚Äôm so in love with her. Like never ako na in love ng ganto ever. So for the past year na we‚Äôve been together, never kami nag karoon ng intimate moment, di ko alam bakit pero pagdating sakanya nakalimutan ko lahat ng alam kong ‚Äúrizz‚Äù sa past experiences ko haha para akong bata na ewan napaparalize ganon haha. Sobrang starstruck ba hahahaha.

So eto na nga. Kahapon we‚Äôre hanging out and one thing led to another (momol lang naman HAHAHAHA). And ewan ko ba mas nangingibabaw sakin yung intense kilig kesa sa satisfaction ng ‚Äúinit sa katawan‚Äù. Never ko naramdaman to sa iba,  siguro kasi dati puro purely sexual lang? Ngayon parang gusto mo kag taklob ng kumot at magsisigaw sa kilig HAHAHA iba yung ‚Äúsatisfaction‚Äù with my gf now tagos sa puso eh HAHAHAH

Wala, yun lang. Sana kayo din ganto na fefeel HAGAHAHAHAHAHAH",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/16f2z3b/iba_pala_talaga_pag_mahal_mo_talaga_yung_ka/,t2_6deylyqg,1694359428.0,1162
My life has been so liberating since I said goodbye to NSFW community ,I left an NSFW community almost two months ago and it feels so liberating since then. I had a hoe phase through NSFW chats only during my vulnerable times. I also did this to validate my femininity and explore my sexuality. There were many creepy men who harassed me in the chat inbox after they saw my explicit posts. I almost dived into hook-up culture but I realized it is harmful for my sexual and mental health. I was deeply shocked when I heard HIV cases in the Philippines are going higher and higher due to main reason: lack of sex education. I'm glad I still have my V-card which I am going to give it to my future lover. I don't want my parents to find out about this especially my father. My father might beat the shit out of me if he ever finds out his daughter becomes a hoe. I know my parents love me pero pakiramdam ko may kulang sa pagkatao ko. Buti na lang pinagsabihan na ko ng mga matitino at nakakatandang Redditors sa akin na wag na ako magpaloko sa mga lalaki dito. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1av0jss/my_life_has_been_so_liberating_since_i_said/,t2_vsc0koxo,1708381124.0,222
Hypersexuality ,"TW: SA

I've never really talked to a psychiatrist since I tried contacting doctors at MakatiMed and they were all busy or unavailable or their secretaries wouldn't pick up the phones.

I read somewhere that although hypersexuality does not have an exact cause, past traumas can have an impact on it. I was sexually abused as a 4 year old by my 14 yr old cousin. I was sexually abused again by a different cousin at 12 yrs old. I never told anyone because I was afraid.

I think being hypersexual is a destructive behavior. I started dating at 19 and would give in to sex with my partners. I thought sex was the only thing I can give to make them stay. And everytime they left me, I would hook up with another guy to get over them. I ended up getting sexually abused by one of the guys I hooked up with.

I'm clean, I get tested every time I get a new sexual partner. I'm also on birth control just as another layer of protection. I have my HPV vaccine as well.

I'm currently in a relationship with (compared to my previous relationships) the best man ever. We have sex of course, it's the best sex ever. I'm very comfortable with my body around him. I can't help but feel bad that I gave myself easily before. I'm afraid that my past will come back and haunt me. So far, my boyfriend respects me during sex. We can be crazy sometimes but when I feel like not having sex, he stops.

Not really sure what I'm posting about and what Im talking about but I guess I'm just grateful for my boyfriend.
