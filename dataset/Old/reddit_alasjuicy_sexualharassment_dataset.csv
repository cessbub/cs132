Men can be victims of sexual harassment too,"Not a juicy story; I am just looking for a place to vent.

--

Kaka simula lang sa work last 2 months ago; at first okay naman, sobrang mababait yung mga co-workers ko. Nagsimula lang ako magkaroon ng problema noong siguro after ng 3rd week ko.

May female senior kasi kami na sobrang touchy sakin. She is married with two kids at hindi ko itatanggi na attractive siya. A tall woman with voluptuous features.

May mga trip kasi siya minsan na sobrang out of the line; gaya pag nagkaka salubong kami minsan, she'll suddenly grab me tapos hahalikan ako sa pisngi tapos magtatawanan sila ng ibang officemate namin na babae. There was also this time na nag la-lunch kami and she probed about my personal life at noong sinabi ko na NGSB ako; she boldly asked if I ever felt a woman's breast before; Siempre sabi ko hindi pa and nagulat ako kasi dinakma niya yung kamay ko; tapos pinatong niya yung kamay ko sa boobs niya then nagtawanan silang lahat. 

There was also this time na na-kasabay namin siya pauwi. Nakisabay lang kami sa sasakyan ng isang officemate namin and sure enough tinabihan niya ko. Naka idlip ako then nagising ako bigla kasi yumakap siya sa braso ko then pag tingin ko; nakatapat saming dalawa yung phone niya habang ka-videocall niya mister niya, and she said ""daddy ito yung kabit ko oh"". And siempre nagalit yung mister niya. I won't delve into much details about this one.

She also sometimes says some suggestive comments like: ""padakma naman niyan"" or ""ubos katas mo sakin"". Things like that

Lumalala lang ng lumalala kasi a few days ago, natutulog ako sa bench sa may lobby namin and then bigla siyang kumandong sakin; grinded me while making exaggerated moaning sounds; all while being video recorded. This time I shoved her away; went to the bathroom to compose myself.

I tried consulting our HR but to no avail since she's tight with everyone in the office. I am just planning on exhausting my 6 months probation period then resign. Fuck it.

I am kind of introverted, reserved and I look pretty young for my age, I think that's the reason because she doesn't pick on our other male co-workers.

And alam ko may mga magsasabi na ""swerte"" or ""sana all"" well I'll be the one to tell you that it's DEGRADING.",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/11sn1z2/men_can_be_victims_of_sexual_harassment_too/,t2_w6ygbcye,1678951127.0
The double standards of being a male victim of sexual harassment,"“Sus para yun lang eh.”

“Ang pussy/loser mo naman boy. Kalalaki mong tao eh.”

“You should be thankful, babae na nag-first move sa’yo.”

“Man up!”

“Tinigasan ka rin naman. Edi gusto mo rin.”

These are the usual words you’ll hear from people whenever we hear a male victim of sexual assault/harassment/violation. What’s worse, these invalidating words usually come from their fellow guys who should be understanding of where the male victim is coming from. Yung iba pa dyan tatawanan yung kapwa lalake nila lalo na pag bading o trans ang nakapambiktima sa kanila, and they would make the victim feel emasculated.

“But males can never be raped. According to the law they need to be penetrated in the anus first for it to constitute as rape.”

^ Kaya nga may sexual assault or harassment na tinatawag, kasi may kanya-kanyang forms ng sexual violation. Guys get groped in public places, they get roofied in bars as well, etc. So just because hindi naman sila na-pwetan, we wouldn’t acknowledge their experience as sexual assault or harassment? That we would be dismissive of their claims and experiences? Even if they had an erection and an orgasm, it doesn’t guarantee that they consented because those are normal involuntary responses of the male body to physical stimuli.

KEYWORD = CONSENT

2022 na, nage-gets na natin ang konsepto ng BDSM, kinks, sex plays, etc. pero hanggang ngayon hindi lahat naga-grasp ang konsepto ng consent na napaka-simple. Call me pa-woke, whatever. But the last thing I would do to someone who claims to be a victim of sexual violation is to invalidate them and their experience.",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/yfjz1b/the_double_standards_of_being_a_male_victim_of/,t2_nufwaasi,1666951205.0
Sexual Harassment,"

Hello guys! This happened noong grade 6 ako. There is this pretty girl na kaklase ko and we're not close btw and I barely even talk to her. And one time me and my friends were messing around doing something stupid like nagsisipaan ng bayag whilst in class hahahaha. Ehh yung girl kasi katapat ko lang on the other side of our table katabi ng friend na kaldyaan ko kaya nakita nya yung ginagawa namin then natawa sya and she gave me this look na parang may gusto syang gawin sakin. 


Tapos nung sumunod na araw habang gumagawa kami ng activity she removed her shoe and started pressing her feet in my dick naka kagat labi pa sya while doing it and nagulat ako tumingin ako sa kanya. Sabi ko ng pabulong kasi andun teacher namin hoy ano ginagwa mo?! Sabi niya  Masarap ba? And sabi ko tigil mo nayan nakakahiya tapos sinabi niya di naman tayo makikita ehh. And then ayun ginawa parin nya the whole day! Then ayun ginawa nya sakin to every day sa school tapos sinabi pa nya na umungol daw ako habang ginaganon niya ako kahit na nag didiscuss teacher namin! Pag di ako nag momoan nilalakasan niya yung pag press sa bayag ko! Shett hahahaha. 



Then eventually nalaman ng friend ko na ganun yung ginagwa sakin ng girl pero di  naman sya nag sumbong pinagkalat nya lang sa tropa nya atsaka sinabi din nya sa little sister nung girl tapos nagalit sakin yung kapatid kinurot kurot ako tapos sinasapak ako  sabi eh bat ko daw ginanon ate nya! Then ayun sabi ko wala akong ginawa siya yung may ginawa sinasalat niya kako ari ko. Di naman sya naniniwala sinasapak parin nya ako and kinukurot hanggang sa mag kasugatsugat na mga braso ko wala naman akong magwa ayoko naman manakit ng bata tinakbuhan ko na lang hahahaha. Then the day after that ayun di ko na pinansin yung babae. 



Oh and the worst part about this is that nag aaral kami sa catholic school!
 I will forever remember this moment hahahaha kasi not only this was my first time having sexual contact with another person it's also the only one and in my opinion is considered sexual harassment.",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/zbau3g/sexual_harassment/,t2_uq8esnup,1670053222.0
people are getting weirder and weirder,"i have seen numerous posts about incest, hyping leaked scandals, and fantasizing about sexual harassment turned successful encounters. it makes me wonder if this is normal and ethical or i am just sensitive? 

incest: like why tf would u talk proudly about incest? 

leaked scandals: isn’t it insensitive to be proud watchers of matters that probably made people depressed because something private about them was leaked? 

fantasizing about successful sexual harassment: it literally just fed and gave confidence to sexual harassers to attempt to sexually harass others with the thought that it’s gonna be a successful encounter.",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/x1i3ej/people_are_getting_weirder_and_weirder/,t2_dgnseti4,1661863313.0
NEW RULES - SEXUAL HARASSMENT STORIES,"Dear Alas Juicy Subscribers,

We would like to announce new rules regarding content here on the sub.

It has come to our attention that there is a recent post that describes public sexual harassment where in OP is the ""attacker"". Now we do not have any proof of the truth as we are on the internet and you should doubt everything you read on here. We'll give the benefit of the doubt to the OP of that post, but whether it is true or not we DO NOT CONDONE any form of sexual harassment be it written, spoken or acted upon. Nor will we tolerate stories depicting it.

[POST IN QUESTION](https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/778xun/unexpected_public_grinding/) - We will not delete this post, this will serve as an example of what NOT to post.

We are hoping that moving forward all posts will have the key factor of **CONSENT** on all the parties involved in the story.

With that we are creating new posting rules:

* Any content regarding sexual harassment be it you are the victim or the attacker is not allowed on the sub.

If you still post stories related to sexual harassment, be it the story itself or inquiry, expect to be called out / reported and deliberated by the Mods of this subreddit. Expect appropriate sanctions if applicable.

We encourage everyone to report any other content that is similar to what was posted, help us moderate this sub, we cannot be online 24/7 to filter through the content.

We do hope that this encourages healthy conversation on the state of public sexual harassment in the Philippines, we know that thousands if not millions of Filipinos get sexually harassed everyday, both men and women it doesn't matter.

**Please be responsible with your sexual desires.**

Thank you, and stay juicy",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/77coua/new_rules_sexual_harassment_stories/,t2_ferro,1508394232.0
Paano ka namulat sa kalibugan?,"During school days marami na akong 
naririnig sa mga kaklase ko na mga napapanood nilang porn videos. I was really curious about it. During that time kasi ang mahal pa magpa kabit ng internet at madalas nag rirent lang ako sa internet shop. 

Nakakahiya namang manood ng porn videos dun sa internet shop andami kasing usisero na nakatayo sa likod at nakikinood sa mga pinapanood mo. I have this one classmate na matalino pero laging tahimik and di masyado nakiki halobilo sa amin.

One time he must have overheard us talking about the porn video my classmate have watched. Sobrang curious ko noon at andami kong tanong. His way home is the same route I take everyday. Kaya nung nagkasabay kami nanibago ako kasi inapproach nya ako.

He asked me ""Wala ba kayong internet sa bahay?"" syempre nakaka panibago na yung usually na tahimik mong kaklase at lagi pang kasama sa top 10 ay bigla kang kakausapin at tatanungin. Kaya tumango na lang ako. He then told me ""gusto manood ng porn sa computer?"" 

Alam mo yung feeling na nagtataka ka and at the same time na excite ka? ganun yung na feel ko nun. ""Di ba tayo mahuli ng nanay at tatay mo?"" I asked him. Then he answered ""Wala naman sa bahay si mama nasa work, si papa naman nasa barko."" 

""Eh pano yung mga kapatid mo?"" I asked him. ""Si kuya nasa Manila nag aaral ng pagbabarko. Ako lang saka yung katulong ang nasa bahay. Di naman yun pumapasok sa room namin kapag di maglilinis."" After ko marinig yun mapanatag na ang kalooban ko. Kaya pumayag na ako na pumunta sa kanila. 

Malaki ang room nila ng kapatid niya halos kasing laki na nga ng salas namin sa bahay. May dalawang kama at may set up ng personal computer sa loob. Nakaka tuwa nga kasi sa bahay namin iisa lang ang banyo di gaya sa kanila. Yung room nila May sariling banyo. Aaminin ko nainggit ako nung makita ko yun. 

Ang sarap siguro tumira sa kanila? May sariling TV sa kwarto at may PSP pa. Nung nag turned on na yung computer nila ibang excitement ang nararamdaman ko hahaha... nainip pa nga ako kasi ang tagal mag bukas. Tapos nag simula na syang mag browse and mukhang alam na alam nya kung saang site makakapanood ng porn.

Somehow napaisip ako, akalain mo bang malibog din pala tong tatahi-tahimik na kaklase ko. Akala ko puro pag aaral lang alam nya. May tinatago din palang kalokohan. Na curious talaga ako sa pinapanood namin kasi patungkol sa step mom yung video. Tinigasan ako agad sa pinapanood namin. 

Ewan ko ba? automatic naging reaksyon ko hahaha mapa hubad ako kaagad ng pantalon at di na ako nahiyang mag jakol kahit andyan pa sya. Siyeeet? dati puro imagination lang ako ngayon napapanood ko na. Ang sarap!!! Nung nakita nya akong nag jajakol di na din sya nahiyang mag hubad ng pantalon at sinabayan na din ako. After nung nangyaring yun, naging bespren ko na sya hahaha... at naging suki na din ako sa bahay nila.

Naawa ako sa mga babaeng nasa porn,"I wish ma abolish na ang porn kasi naaawa ako sa mga babaeng gumagawa for the sake of money and obviously it is  scripted. I did even cry and roll eyes on some scenes kasi halatang finefake ng babae yung ginaggawa niya and moan like memsh they don't deserve it. I also read some porn stars did regret their careless action but unfortunately it will be forever be in google not unless someone more powerful can erase it on their database which I guess is far fetched not unless you have that big connection. May ibanng tao into cnc but there are people na not into cnc and nadadamay yung iba and are sexually harassed. I know porn is a big industry same with human and sex trafficking but this is just so sad kasi in the end kawawa ang babae. It can also trigger cheating in a way kasi di naman lahat ng babae into ""that"" action but kasi partner sila they have to submit like memsh if you're not comfortable you can say no. Can't we just normalize love making without engaging in porn. I find porn bad and useless and evil.",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/16gdzs9/naawa_ako_sa_mga_babaeng_nasa_porn/,t2_hrp00g8q4,1694482502.0
Not A Juicy Post: MRT SH Frequency?,"TW: Sexual Harassment
——
This is not for your typical public transportation groping fantasy.

I was just curious earlier on how much SH do women who commute using trains experience daily? Especially during rush hour, sobrang sikip and at some stations, tulakan talaga just to get in the train. Inoobserve ko yung mga kasabay ko na mga babae and can’t help but think if they’re experiencing SH in such a situation, and how frequent does it happen. Kasi even for me as a guy, I get uncomfortable with so much people pushing around.

Muntik na,"Well, start pa lang ng day mejj horny na ako but nakalimutan ko siya since busy sa work. Kanina pauwi ako, may nakatabi ako na guy sa van. Since nakamask siya, di ko alam itsura niya and nakaramdam ako ng hornyness kasi bet ko yung physique ng body niya. Also, madilim din sa van.

Iniisip kong hawakan yung ano niya at ihandjob siya. Wet na ako thinking na hinahandjob ko siya sa public transpo. Pero mga teeeh, di ko kaya. Sexual harassment pa rin. 😭😭😭😭 Huhu.

Getting out of the hook up culture,"It started hooking up pre-pandemic 2020. I was 19 years old then. I just got out of an unlabeled relationship (or in today's terms, situationship) dahil nakipag-momol ako sa ex-girlfriend ko. Yes, my fault. I turned to sexual satisfaction para madistract, primarily through dating apps. Within a week, I had different sexual partner. There was even a day na I had two different partners. It was too late that I realized na I had too much of a body count. From dating apps, nag-aaya na rin ako sa mga friends ko. I also became too persistent in asking sexual encounters to the point that women felt harassed or objectified. I also got an STI, pero na-treat naman agad through meds. Things went wrong when this destructive behavior of mine went public months ago. I lost connections, friends, opportunities, and such. It was very difficult and saddening, pero tanggap ko dahil consequences ito ng grave errors ko. While I found temporary satisfaction in sex, it also destroyed me.

I've been clean for four months, pero may relapse pa rin in between. There's a tendency for me na mag-aya, pero I also hold myself back din relagating my sexual favors to wholesome dates. Mahirap na proseso ang pag-alis sa hook up culture dahil matagal akong naging part nito, pero kailangan ko ring sampalin ang sarili ko na kailangan kong gawin 'to. This is part of my accountability to the people I've hurt.

Just a tip for someone who's looking forward to partake in the hook up culture, at the minimum, practice safe sex and let consent be not just a permission but also be a safeguard for your right. At the maximum, coming from experience, don't. Having a lot of sexual partners doesn't amount to sex with a single person whom you genuinely share love with. Some may have a different, good experience, but in the long run, I think we'll all agree that it's just temporary satisfaction.

I'd appreciate comments that could help me in my struggle, as well as criticisms. If you're currently in the same battle, we can have a conversation to share our feelings to each other. Thank you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/167t48w/getting_out_of_the_hook_up_culture/,t2_i421zfx2l,1693629706.0
no means no,"When I made this new Reddit account, I wondered how long it would take for someone to send me an unsolicited dick pic. Five days, people. I did not even express any need for sex during the last five days.

I clearly said no, yet this guy flooded my chatbox with his junk asking for a dickrate. I kindly (and later on, bluntly) asked him to stop and find someone else who is interested, while educating him to ask consent first (I don't want to block and report him right away — I want to try educating him first kasi baka may ibang girls pa siyang maharass after me). Idk if his brain crawled its way down to his dick because he clearly ignored me and kept on showing his post-deed dick.

Showing off your thing will not make me horny. Actually, doing it without my permission is a big turn off kahit pa grabe ang pent-up lust ko or kahit ideal junk pa pinapakita mo. Yes, I'm openminded and my libido is beyond average, pero I'm not that desperate to entertain some random guy just because I've seen his dick. There's a reason why I've been enduring this unbearable dry spell for three years and only had one partner before that. I am not interested in casual hookups or online R18+ landian. Nandito ako sa Reddit para tumambay, magbasa, magkwento at makipag-usap kapag feel ko — not to find someone to hook up with. And I'm sure there are girls out there who are just like me.

Many girls have already complained about this issue so many times. Yet, there are still some guys who can't comprehend a simple no. Why don't some people get it? Sending unsolicited dick pic is not a shortcut to someone else's pants. It's just plain harassment and disrespect especially when the other party directly said no.

CONSENT IS IMPORTANT. NO MEANS NO. Openly talking about sexual stuff is definitely not a sexual innuendo or invitation.

Wag niyo ipagpilitan sarili niyo sa taong ayaw sa inyo. Hindi niyo ikakagwapo yan.",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/vtwu1w/no_means_no/,t2_pivwm4hi,1657238434.0
How my coworker crush became my FuBu,"I had a crush on a coworker guy for 5 years. Introvert din sya like me. He is so quiet and he does not seem to have any interest in me. Kaso sapiosexual ako so I fell for him every time he shares his thoughts and ideas about work.

Our stations are in front of each other. We are literally facing each other everyday, the whole day. Ang cute nya. 6ft tall sya and somehow may pagkachildish at shy yung smile nya. Needless to say di nya alam I am smitten by the small stuff he does for me. We became friends but not too close until one night.

We went into an overnight outing with out close coworker friends. Lahat sila alam na I like him. Manhid lang talaga sya lol. Somebody asked if wala syang gf who would he be dating in the office. He said my name walang patumpik-tumpik. I was asked the same question, so I said his name. Magkatabi na kami sa van pauwi and he kept holding my hand.

The next day, he sent me a message that he was serious sa sagot nya. Turns out sapiosexual din sya and he had a crush on me for quite some time. Di naman ako kagandahan and I am on the heavy side so di ko naman inexpect na magkagusto sya. Kontento na sana ako sa lihim kong pagkacrush sa kanya. 

Usually, kami ang madalas huling umuuwi after office hours me being the general manager at sya department head directly reporting under me. Super stressed lagi sa work. One night, he found me crying due to stress and personal matters. Wala ng tao sa office. Sira ang cctv.

I told him why I was crying. I was really down that time and mag isa lang ako sa buhay so it felt better when he hugged me tight. And we kissed just the way I used to daydream. He is a good kisser with small bites and fiesty tongue. Though I think I was the one who initiated it. Not sure.  

He hugged me tight again and I felt his bulge. Needless to say it got steamy. He squeezed my tits and slides his hands inside my undies to play with my clit. Dun palang I started to get wet. He said he is never an adventurous guy but he always imagined fucking me on the table. 

Pero lumuhod muna ako. I gave him his first BJ. I was sex derprived for a few years na and so I pulled my best performace. I lightly kissed his chest down to his abdomen. I licked around the base of his dick and balls without touching his dick coz I want him to crave. When I saw na lalo na syang tumitigas, I licked the head then sucked the whole dick  shoving all the way down my throat, all the while still lightly touching his balls and thighs. I played with his balls then started sucking his whole dick harder and faster. I also flipped my tongue on the underside of his dick while sucking. He kept pulling my hair habang binubulong nya pangalan ko. 

He pulled me up and isa-isa nyang binuksan yung buttons ng damit ko. He undid my bra and sucked my nipples. Malaki din yung boobs ko so he buried his face sa cleavage ko. Pinatong nya ako sa table then put his dick in me. He pumped me like no tomorrow. Gigil na gigil sya so lalo akong nabasa. He pumped while kissing me. Then he pulled out and came. Di ako nag orgasm :( sadly di ako yung tipong madaling labasan.

He kissed me on the lips and forehead. Then we cleaned up. Tapos he massaged my legs kasi lumuhod ako ng matagal hihihi while promising that he can learn how to eat me and I can teach him how to make me cum. So that's how he proposed to be my fubu.

Sex deeds would happen in the office during those hours until he was forced to get the cctv fixed coz 1 old coworker sexually harassed me. Para daw mabantayan nya ako hahaha as if naman we are more than fubu. He is a great fubu but will not make a good BF I realized after getting to know him more. My crush on him subsided but we still have sex every week.

Anyways, we just do it here sa condo na lang. He just comes here anytime he wants since I gave him my door passcode. I'd cook dinner and then he eats me after as dessert. Expert na sya ngayon hihi I guess I am a good teacher. I'd eat a mint candy while giving him a BJ coz he loves it. We did all his sex fantasies and positions new to him. Now, we also use my toys to add fun and pleasure.",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/15whrqv/how_my_coworker_crush_became_my_fubu/,t2_6qoh57lk,1692553450.0

I feel guilty of the things I should have not done,"Early 20's and I'd be lying if the pressure of being single hasn't gotten the best of me. This lead to the previous months with me in omegle and bumble looking for people to explore my sexuality with (consensual) with people.  
  
Awkward would describe the feeling of exploring this side of me, knowing the only experience I had was being sexually harassed where my coach in college took advantage of me, groomed me and leading to him sexually harassing me during a party many years ago. I was so drunk that time and I don't remember giving consent but that experience awakened my urge to touch myself a lot.  
  
Moving back, the first set of people who I get the chance to converse with in omegle were nothing much, some didn't go anywhere and some were too kind/nice and I didn't proceed any further, of course while keeping in mind of consent and being subtle about it, until I met C.  
  
C has more drive compared to me and she was the first to invite me into doing the deed while on video. It was my first time as well. We did it frequently, 3x maybe even more. More so, this lead to the two of us becoming online fubu's for quite some time until one day - when I did not notice that C was not in a mood to do it (vocal tone change) and only realized when C chatted that C was was feeling uncomfortable during our call. I immediately stopped the dirty talks and apologized repeatedly to C. C sounded teary eyed and told me that I shouldn't worry too much about that and that it was okay because I apologized and that I recognize that I went overboard during the call.  
  
This incident however made me incredibly guilty with myself, I know I am supposed to be a morally upright person and there are times where I could focus with my review, work, and even while playing. My inner self constantly reminds myself that I have become the very person who I hate and condemn the most, and there was no atonement to what I have done.  
  
C did send me a message a couple of days ago asking if how I was doing but I just told C that I still felt disgusted with myself after what happened. C then told me that she missed talking with me and that there's not need to say sorry and that everything is okay. Honestly I can't chat her at this point knowing what I did and the constant reminder of my inner self of the kind of monster that I have become. I know there's no atonement to all that I've done but I wish I did not explore this side of me. I regret everything that happened for the past months.  
  
I'm sorry.  
  
PS. sorry for the broken English, I'm not good at it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/sii338/i_feel_guilty_of_the_things_i_should_have_not_done/,t2_j9lvprsy,1643785024.0
how do you open up the idea of having a fwb/fubu setup?,"There's this girl at work na may crush saakin and talks about it openly like nagpaparinig na ""hi daddy"", ""ang pogi mo"", ""just call me baby"", etc in a joking pabebe manner pero she and her friends told me na she is attracted to me kasi I asked if she was serious or nagjojoke lang ba sila so it's not me being narcissistic or what. Medyo wala siyang hiya for saying those kinds of lines pero her being kalog makes her attractive. Her also being openly joking about sexual stuff makes me want her more.

Ako naman, I don't really reciprocate the same energy and I just smile and laugh pero I told her I'm not offended at all and don't feel any ounce of sexual harassment. Kumbaga parang play lang. 

Sa ngayon, I'm acting passively and not outright rejecting her kasi I don't want to lose this catch and I have a crush on her as well (she's really sexy and ang lakas ng appeal) pero I'm scared of actually reciprocating since I know na I should not be in a relationship because I'm working on myself first. One thing is for sure though, I want to fuck her. 

There's mutual physical attraction but one side (mine) is not yet known by the other. How, where, and when do I open up a fwb/fubu setup without sounding desperate or like a creep? 

Some other details if it helps in formulating advice for my situation:
- we barely know each other's lives outside of the office kasi I keep my conversations with my officemates just within our work and outside of my personal life. This also means I don't really go out with them when nagaaya sila uminom or may party.
- we are not ""friends"" in a way na kaibigan talaga na kakwentuhan mo parati. We're friends because we're connected through work. So we're not really close. She just jokes around everyday and I just keep riding on her jokes.",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/11g0lxc/how_do_you_open_up_the_idea_of_having_a_fwbfubu/,t2_nis7kpns,1677757016.0

Then one time, tinanong niya ko if how many fingers do I use kapag nagfifinger ako, and some other details about playing with myself. 

Mind you, may gf siya ah. Bakit siya ganun magtanong? Curious lang ba siya? I mean, I don’t mind him asking kasi ganun kami kaclose. I just want to know about other people’s perspective about this especially guys mismo.",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/156pkiv/bakit_ganun_siya_magtanong/,t2_acx7n2re,1690045756.0
Deal Breakers,"TL;DR mga taong hindi pasok sa preferences, nagrereklamo dahil hindi sila pasok sa preferences

Natatawa ako sa mga tao from a certain subreddit na people are familliar na just add dirty before its name and you'll already know what I'm talking about.

Nagrereklamo sila sa mga preferences ng ibang tao from another certain subreddit pero without the ""dirty"" na bakit daw kailangan na conversationalist at may political preferences? Never pa daw sila nakakita na gusto ng DDS or BBM puro nalang daw kakampuke ang preferred.

May factor daw ba mga yun habang in action? Aba'y malamang, parang starterpack na yan bilang tao sa kung paano siya mag-isip and sa kung paano siya kikilos and makikitungo sa ibang tao in relations sa kung anong klaseng pag-iisip ang meron siya. The fact na hindi nila gets kung bakit factor yun and even using the term ""kakampuke"" already speaks about them as a person eh hahahaha.

Let's just say na karamihan ng mga supporter ng isang side is mga utak rapist or kaya naman mga victim blamer sa usaping sexual abuse, harassment, and the like. I wonder paano kaya sila during the deed kung ganyan pala sila magisip? I wonder lang naman???

Though hindi naman ibig sabihin na ""kakampuke"" or leftist na isang tao is better na agad siya, syempre meron din na mga kupal kahit sang ayon pa kayo sa candidate niyo is hindi naman ibig sabihin tugma na kayo sa actual social issue discussions may mga utak rapist pa din dyan. Pero kung DDS o BBM talaga 80% of the time kupal e.

Tsaka isa pa, yung mga post na nirereklamo nila is hindi naman natatapos sa sex lang. Yan ang problema e nabasa nila naman post and hindi naman sila ang hanap bakit nagrereklamo? Edi doon sila sa tutugma tungkol sa kanila imbis na nagrereklamo sa posts na hindi naman para sa kanila, dyan palang lumalabas na kabobohan e 🚩🚩🚩 di malabo one day makakita nalang tayo sa details na non-negotiable yung may isip. Panigurado sila mga uri ng tanga na hindi naman pasok sa preferences ng OP pero ichachat pa din.

Oh ilag nalang mga bobo, alam kong madami din kayo dito sa AlasJuicy.

Motorcycle Taxi Driver offered me to touch his D,"EDIT: DISCLAIMER lang po, I do not in anyway condone sexual harassment in public transportation and this post is not meant to encourage PUV drivers to make sexual advances towards their passengers in any way. Always ask for CONSENT hmmkayyy?

Kapag nakaka-encounter ako ng mga ganitong stories dito sa AlasJuicy, first thing that comes to my mind is “Napaka-imposible naman mangyari niyan lol”. I thought fantasy kink lang ‘to ng ilan, until it personally happened to me awhile ago.

Kaka-out ko lang ng office kanina, wearing a sexy dress na above the knee ‘yung skirt. I was also wearing a small fitted coat, and matched my whole outfit with sexy pumps (heels). Since I was wearing heels and carrying a laptop, I didn’t want to go through the hassle of commute. Ayoko rin naman mag cab or grab kasi mahal ang charge for a short distance. So I finally decided to book a motorcycle taxi kahit ganun ‘yung outfit ko.

When Kuya Rider arrived, I noticed he had that wholesome ‘Kuya’ look — ‘yung tipong kuya ng kalaro mo noong childhood mo na naging crush mo? Ganun ‘yung vibes niya. He was smiling at me and ang gentle ng trato at pakikipag-usap niya sa’kin (siya kasi mismo nagsuot ng helmet ko and kept asking if comfy ba ako). He also asked if dun ba ko nagwo-work kung san niya ko pinick-up, taga-san ba raw ako, and if may jowa ba raw ako. Ako naman siyempre ayoko maging feelingera at mag-assume that he’s hitting on me, kasi siyempre diba baka customer service-oriented lang talaga ‘yung personality niya and he just likes to build rapport with his passengers. When riding the motorcycle, sanay ako na nakahawak sa back part ng motor to have more control of my balance. Suddenly, he offered;

“Ma’am hawak nalang po kayo sa balikat ko.”

So I did.

After 2-3 minutes, napapansin niya na umaatras ako pag bigla niya napapaandar ‘yung motor when the stop light goes green. So this time, he offered naman to touch his waist;

“Ma’am dito nalang po kayo humawak sa bewang ko para hindi po kayo napapa-atras pag umaandar ako bigla.”

To which I obliged, kahit never akong humahawak sa bewang ng driver when riding a motorcycle.

So this time, everytime na bigla siya umaandar, hindi na ganoon kalakas ‘yung atras ko. But I unconsciously kept squeezing his hips with my thighs kasi nga feel ko mahuhulog pa rin ako. Then suddenly out of nowhere when we were in a less bright area, he offered me to touch his dick;

“Ma’am hawakan mo.”

“Po?” I asked.

“Hawakan mo po.”

“Ang alin po Kuya?” patay-malisya kong tinanong.

“‘Yung alaga ko po ma’am.”

“Hahahaa” I just chuckled in response kasi hindi pa ganun nag-sink in sa’kin what was happening. I’m not necessarily creeped-out, but that was sudden. Nagka-experience na ko with a Taxi Driver pero may build-up ‘yung sexual tension namin kahit papaano. But this Kuya Rider? He’s so straight-forward.

Maybe he took my laughter as a positive response, so he grabbed my right hand from his waist and put it on his hard bulge. I FROZE. Not out of fear, but I kept asking myself internally: “Fuck, is this really happening?” Pinapa-twitch pa niya ‘yung dick niya habang nakapatong dun ‘yung kamay ko, which was also pressed-on by his hand. Suddenly may tumabi sa amin na isa pang motorcycle rider, I didn’t want to make a spectacle so I immediately removed my hand from his crotch. Umandar kami ulit and he spoke;

“Ma’am okay lang kayo dyan sa likod?”

“Oo Kuya okay lang ako.” I thought to myself, this dude is gauging whether or not I got creeped out by what he did. A minute or so, he asked again;

“Ma’am hawakan mo ulit hehe.”

“Halah Kuya nasa public tayo, baka may makakita sa’kin at magvideo. Baka mag-viral pa tayo hahaha.” I refused.

“Check-in ma’am gusto mo?” He asked again.

“Pass Kuya. Need ko na rin umuwi hehe pagod na rin ho ako galing work.” I replied.

After that, hindi naman na siya nagpumilit lalo na malapit na kami sa drop-off area ko. Upon arriving there, he gave me the same gentle treatment as before despite putting my hand on his crotch and just waved take care.

Now I’m not gonna lie, I was really turned on by what happened lalo na medyo type ko si Kuya Rider at spontaneous ‘yung pangyayari, and there’s also the thrill of getting caught. However, I refused his proposal because:

1. Baka i-charge niya ako ng extra. Although hindi niya na-bring up ‘to, there are cases ng mga motor riders na nagpapahipo sa passengers nila (both girls and gays) pero magugulat ka nalang kasi may extra charge pala ‘yun pag ibababa ka na nila. Tapos aawayin ka kapag hindi ka nagbayad sa amount na dine-demand nila.
2. I was wearing vivid-colored clothes and we were in public. It’s so easy to get caught, at baka mamaya mag-viral nalang ako bigla dahil kinakalikot ko ‘yung matigas na pototoy ng rider ko 😂
3. Medyo gusto ko muna mag-detox sa tite hahaha I get dick pics and sex invites everyday here in reddit and sa telegram. So for the first time, I actually prioritized going home than getting dicked down.

Now while writing this, I’m thinking what adventure or pleasure I should’ve experienced had I said yes awhile ago? 🤔

being a Demisexual is so good.,"Never realised how my gender is like a water flowing. It’s not static but it changes over time. This deeply affected my sexual attraction. Before my body felt like alien to me.. but ever since I felt at home in my own body. I started becoming curious and opening new doors for me.

I started questioning myself. What does it feel like to be penetrated with a penis? I used to be so afraid because I experienced sharing spaces with exhibitionists in public transportation. That made me very much afraid of Phalluses. I was sexually harassed and it affected how I see it as something aggressive.

Last year. I’ve had my first PIV sex. It was eye opening and my mind was blown. The feeling of finally having all the answers to all of my questions. It was a huge turning point in my life.

Fast forward to now. My hot boi summer hoe era. There was a week that I was so busy with a lot of dudes. Like 2 guys a day. We would fuck and I wouldn’t even know their name. Hahaha and they would even pay for my uber or even my room just so things can happen. Never felt so spoilt and cared for. It made me see how easy and difficult it is hooking up with men and women. It is really different. 

Being a demisexual is really new to me. But I feel this is the best thing to describe my sexuality. I often get invited as a third also. I attract couples lately. But as of now I am not emotionally and physically ready to be with 2 people at once. Boundaries and kinks must be discussed first. To avoid spicy events.

Quotang quota na ko sa tite. So bilat naman HAHA. Totoo talaga ang After Sex Glow yun lang ang masasabi ko. I’m currently thriving. A lot of my friends have noticed it and made sure to mention it to me how I look so happy and glowing. I say dasurv. Since ang daming shit na nangyare last year. Confidence comes from within. Loving yourself is the priority. Once you are able to do this, the rest will follow. You will attract what you deserve. Meet people who’s good for your soul.

To end this. It’s not about what gender is better in bed. Rather it’s how you connect your soul and body with your sexual partner. Sex should always be a pleasurable experience to all parties.",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/u2d8f7/being_a_demisexual_is_so_good/,t2_bmvgrwis,1649808772.0
Long weekend! Let's go!,"Happy long weekend AJ! Last week, I posted my horrible experience and sumabog naman po ang dm ko. Salamat sa mga nagextend ng concern. Sa mga nang victim blame, kakasuka kayo. 2022 na, utak rapist and enabler pa rin kayo ng sexual harassment. Wala bang pa-character development diyan? 

Feeling niyo naman mabababa niyo composure ko sa pangsslut shame niyo? Utot niyo, hahahahaha! I have worked so damn hard to improve and achieve my self concept right now and hindi ang mga kagaya niyong timawa sa tawag ng laman ang makakapagpababa sa pagkatao ko. Yang mga insecurity niyo wag niyo ng ipasa sa mga pinupursue niyo naman. Bago kayo magmaganda at magmagwapo sa hook up at ONS, ayos ayos muna ng sarili para di kayo nagkakalat ng katoxican. 

Pasabi sabi pa sila na kesyo nabasa nila posts ko before at bigay na bigay naman daw ako kay lactacyd boy. Kasi GUSTO KO at DESISYON KO yun. Personal kong pinili iyon. No one can dictate who I should have sex with. Kung ginusto ko kay lactacyd boy at inayawan kita, eh dahil personal kong desisyon iyon. Bakit ka makikialam sa personal kong gusto? Paladesisyon ka? Ayusin niyo muna yang issue niyo sa rejection bago kayo maghanap ng makakantot. Pag nireject kayo, ako ang malandi tapos pasad boi na kesyo ang taas ng standards ko? Aba dapat lang. Ang ganda ganda ko and ang mahal ng gastos ko sa skin care and all eh. I get to choose who I want to have sex with. And all of you don't get to have a say on that. Maligo at manamit ng maayos at wag galawang rapist para may laban kayo. 

Ssend kayo ng invite to get to know tapos may paguilt trip at pasad boi na hindi kayo papasok sa standards ko kasi ganito, kasi ganyan. Na kesyo ito lang kase ako eh. Aba naman besh. Importante ang standards mga accla. Aba tangina naman kung papuki na, patherapy pa after? Lahat naman tayo may issue pero ano ba naman mga kyah. Sex lang supposed to be habol natin, gusto niyo may therapy din? Seek help first tapos landi after pag okay na. Kaya ko naman magcomfort pero sana pala nagopen forum nalang tayo kesa magkantutan. Maginuman nalang tayo kung ganon. HAHAHAHA. 

Tsaka wag niyo na din ako tanungin about dun sa main acct ni bb boy kasi happy na siya. Ako, forever akong may regret for what happened but I can handle my shit in life just fine. Wag niyo na din akong sendan na papaligayahin niyo ko and ililigtas sa heartache kasi hindi naman ako damsel in distress, jusko. HAHAHAHA. I don't need to be saved. HAHAHAHA. Gusto ko ng sex kasi masarap (wala ng plastikan mga mumsh) pero hindi ako lego na kailangan niyong ibuild. Wag kayong pa-hero. I can handle myself just fine. Mas magiging okay tayo kung rekta kayo sa mga gusto niyo (pero hindi ibig sabihin nun eh free pass na lahat, wag bungol) but not the point of being a douche na halatang puro yabang lang ang alam niyo. Iyong totoong at kayang ibuga lang ng pagkatao niyo. 

Enjoy the long weekend mga mumsh. Kantot responsibly and safely! Ipaalam sa mga friends and family members kung saan kayo makikipag meet up para iwas masemento sa drum or kidnap.

"Ladies of AJ, which of the following does the trick?","I'm genuinely curious, and I want to know if I can find women here who shares the same likes as I do. I think this would be a great way to find common ground with the other women here, and to feel more accepted for the sexual choices we have.



I don't really rely on visuals to masturbate since I'm the old school, audio only, phonesex kind of gal. But I won't ever deny that I need it every now and then when I don't have a partner or if I craved for something or if I want an itch scratched.



So now I'm curious, which of the four typical scenarios would do the trick and immediately, with the shortest period of time, helps you cum. Is it: 




**A. Seeing straight fucking**

*Basically, it's a guy fucking a girl, with or without  sadomasochism, and all that jazz. Whatever position. Wherever. Whomever.*




**B. Seeing a  guy eating a girl or fingering her.**

*So, that's eating pussy or fingering, or both. No penetration. Just oral and the pussy play.*




**C. Seeing a guy jacking off.**

*This is just looking at a guy masturbate, with or without toys. No  penetration. No oral. Just him and his agenda.*




**D. Seeing another girl masturbating.**

*A girl fingering herself, using toys, a vibrator, in her pussy or mouth. Basically, playing with herself to orgasm or to squirt, or both.*



And just to be more interesting, tell me what makes it stand out from the other choices, or what makes it your weapon, or your poison.



**Let me start:**


* Mine is C. Seeing a guy jacking off.*

**I'm really not a visual person but lately I've been so into seeing guys jacking off and waiting for them to cum. It's not exactly seeing their cock that gets me going but hearing them moan, grunt, and curse while they masturbate and the amount of cum they have turn me on. What blows my mind is when they make a mess and even taste themselves (sorry, it's my thing). I CUM IMMEDIATELY, even under three minutes. It's THAT effective for me.**



I hope to find people who might share the same kinks that I do, so to feel more ""accepted"". Let's not judge people based on their choices. I'm excited to know what gets you going and what gets you off. And I hope this wouldn't invite creeps to harass those who answer, but instead just learn from what results we'd get.",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/14t3bkc/ladies_of_aj_which_of_the_following_does_the_trick/,t2_ixqbp61r,1688725658.0
I had a FakeTaxi moment,"FOREWORD (wow thesis charr): I do not in anyway condone sexual harassment in public transportation and this post is not meant to encourage PUV drivers to make sexual advances towards their passengers in any way. Always ask for CONSENT hmmkayyy?

I met up with this guy from the g-app. He was nice and decent overall but the thing was he lied about his age (he’s younger, but not a minor) and that he tried to kiss me sa lips even when I said I don’t just casually kiss people I just met. He also kept holding my hands which is I’m not used to immediately doing with strangers. To make our meet-up worse, bigla nasira sasakyan niya mga bandang midnight because it won’t start so di niya ko mahahatid pauwi. I really had to go kasi may pasok pa ko kinabukasan so we just decided na magtaxi nalang ako.

Thankfully kahit midnight na, meron naman pumara and accepted me as a passenger. Pagkasakay ko, I immediately rolled my eyes sa irita ko sa meet-up ko. Mga 5 minutes ng byahe, the driver saw pala na umirap ako and asked;

“Ma’am boyfriend niyo po?”

“Hindi kuya, casual date lang” sagot ko.

“Ahh okay po. Akala ko bf nyo po tapos nagbreak na po kayo hehe” sabi niya, after niya ma-notice ‘yung pag-irap ko pagkasakay.

“Ah wala yun kuya yaan mo na” sagot ko naman.

Another 5 minutes of silence, napapansin ko si Kuya na tingin nang tingin sa rearview mirror nya. Nahuli ko siya and our eyes met, pero ngumiti lang ako.

Pagkatigil sa stoplight, tumingin siya sa likod to check out the motorcycles behind his taxi kasi medyo malapit ata. And ohh boy upon seeing him up close, he’s a chubby-fit na daddy/tito who’s in his early to mid 30’s— exactly my target market. Sabi ko sa sarili ko internally; “TITIKMWAAAHHNNN 😏😱😝😜🤪” HAHHAHAHAAA

Pero syempre kahit ganon reaction natin internally dapat composed pa rin tayo. Napatingin siya sa’kin and we made eye contact. He then told me;

“Ma’am ang ganda niyo po ano? ang sexy pa. May kamukha po kayong artista.” Banat niya.

“Ahahahaa sino naman kuya?” Tanong ko while laughing flirtatiously.

“Di ko alam pangalan basta superhero role niya” he answered.

“Kuya echosero ka hahahaa” sagot ko naman pabiro.

“Sayang naman date niyo ngayong gabi ma’am. Pag ako may naka-date na kasing ganda mo baka di ko na pakawalan.” And yada yada yada the typical pambobola by a guy chz.

Upon hearing those, nagkaron ako ng animé moment where a quick zing flashed into my ear and exited on the other. I asked myself internally in Joe Goldberg’s voice, “Ohh… is he hitting on me? Are you hitting on me? Okay then… I’ll bite.”

So to test the waters if my assumption was right, medyo nilandi ko yung boses ko when talking to him (Thank you DJ ChaCha). I used my *siren voice* while talking and laughing. Napasarap usapan namin until di ko namalayan na medyo malapit na pala ako sa bahay. Eh at the time our flirty talk made me immediately horny for some reason. So I tried to make a ‘small talk’ with him;

“Kuya ingat ka pag dumaan ka dun sa kalsadang yun pauwi kasi delikado dun. Uuwi ka na ba after mo maghatid sa’kin?” Sabi ko while nakasandal, sabay open ng legs ko and angat konti ng skirt— ensuring he can see my legs and a portion of my panties.

“Bakit, gusto mo na ba ko umuwi?” And then he gave me THE SMIRK

“Hindi naman kuya. Enjoy nga ako kausap ka eh” sabi ko naman

“Gusto mo usap pa tayo matagal? May alam akong spot dyan ma’am hahaa” he chuckled.

Upon hearing those in his sexy husky voice, CONFIRMED. Daddy wants to get it charottt so I said;

“sure” sabay tawang mahinhin pangmalandi hahhaaa

Lumayo muna kami sa area ng house ko para puntahan yung spot na alam nya sa may pagkalampas ng Market-Market, bago mag buting flyover. On the way doon, sabi niya sa’kin;

“Ma’am hawakan mo”

Nagulat ako na na-excite. Pero syempre kunware inosente ako so sinagot ko siya;

“Hawakan ang alin kuya? 😅”

“Hawakan mo ‘yung bukol sa pantalon ko” sabi niya.

I slowly reached my hand to his legs, then pataas sa may crotch. Nilapit ko lips ko sa ears niya sabay bulong;

“Dito ba?” I said in a sexy voice. While hawak sa crotch area niya sa pantalon.

Nagulat ako mga atits at otits kasi tigas na tigas ang etits nya. Tumitibok na mainit parang may sariling buhay. He then unzipped his pants and binaba nya halfway, only exposing his boxers.

“Laruin mo muna ma’am” sabi niya.

Lumipat ako sa harap sa tabi ng driver’s seat para di naman awkward position namin. I then played and caressed his hard dick as we were on our way dun sa spot na alam niya. A few minutes, medyo basa na ‘yung boxers niya ng precum. Parang katas ng okra teh yung lumalabas sa etits niya hahahaa

For part 2, kindly wait kasi medyo mahaba ‘to lolz

"pride month psa: lesbian/bisexual/queer women are real people, not objects of male fantasy","* If you find out someone is a lesbian or bisexual, do not hit them up with ""Can I watch you make out with another girl?"" ""Do you want a threesome?"" ""Do you want to be the girl in our FFM/MFM session?"" **If they're not seeking any sexual encounter of that sort, leave them alone.**
* If you see people sharing NSFW photos or videos of them and their girlfriend, it's very likely they have no interest in you or other men. **Stop offering/asking/harassing lesbians about having sex with a guy.**
* If you are creating original content like erotic literature or audio porn, try to assess if you're depicting gay sex between two women as something they actually want, not just something they're doing for the pleasure of a man. **You are not honoring or paying tribute to pride month if your content caters to the fetishization of gay women.**
* Depicting lesbian women as willing to engage with men if the man turns them on enough is a harmful notion to perpetuate. It's never a case of ""they just haven't met/slept with the right man yet"". They don't want men. Period. **You cannot ""turn"" gay women straight.**
* Just because a woman is bisexual doesn't mean she's automatically seeking and interested in group sex. **Being attracted to both men and women is not synonymous with being polyamorous.**
* Just because lesbians are attracted to women does not mean they will 100% love to join a threesome with a man and his girlfriend. They still will not want to engage in sex with you. **The presence of a woman doesn't give you access to having sex with lesbians.**

***Important note:*** There is nothing wrong with enjoying lesbian, gay, bisexual, or even trans porn! It is completely fine to find them hot and to see two (or more) people visibly being pleasured by each other. The issue is fetishization, which is the act of making someone an object of sexual desire based on some aspect of their identity. It dehumanizes them. Fantasies and/or media that entertain the fetishization of gay/bi/queer people that way dismisses and disrespects the fact they are real people with their own choices and preferences, with a sexuality that caters to what they like and what they like alone.

These are just some things I'd like to remind people of, coming from my experiences as a bi girl as well as my lesbian, bisexual, and queer friends'. It might seem like common sense, but unfortunately you still see some of these harmful stereotypes floating around the internet and even in real life. I'm sure a lot of these apply to the experiences of gay and bisexual men as well, but of course I can only speak for my personal experiences and those of my friends'. Let's be respectful and learn to de-objectify gay/bisexual/queer members of the LGBT community.

discussions about consent,"*disclaimer: non-juicy, but i'm a firm believer that consent is a necessary ingredient to a juicy experience.*

contrary to popular notion, consent is not usually verbally communicated – lalo na sa ating mga filipino na very big on ""pakikiramdam"". kaya rin madalas, marami sa mga biktima ng sexual harassment/assault, pinagdududahan at sinisisi ang sarili nila na baka hindi nila gaano naidiin yung pag-hindi.

with that said, how do you usually communicate consent in the bedroom?

sa mga nag-first move to up the relationship to something sexual, how did you determine that it was time? kunyare, kiss kiss lang kayo before, paano niyo napagtantong okay nang mangkapkap? bigla niyo na lang bang ginawa at inantay kung aayaw siya?

have you ever been in a situation na ayaw mo pero napilitan ka lang?

alternatively, has your partner ever told you na napilitan lang sila? what did you say and how did you feel about it?

*(skip if you don't want to read my personal eme)*

i'm (23F) asking this kasi i'm still having a hard time understanding if ako ba yung mali, yung ex ko ba may mali, o 'di lang talaga kami nagkaintindihan.

this is five years ago, ha. pero nasa isip ko pa rin.

we were kids when we first met, both teens with zero experience. i was your typical modern filipina who can talk about sex openly and joke about it with my friends, but to be honest, wala talaga akong alam. hindi kasi ako nanonood ng porn, hindi rin nagmamasturbate.

i also tried to keep everything wholesome with him at that time bilang getting to know pa lang kami. we were very touchy, pero hug hug lang, holding hands ganun. innocent stuff.

four months into the talking/dating stage, he asked me if he could kiss me this coming christmas. 'di ako sumagot but i was open to the idea. i even searched on youtube pa'no makipaghalikan HAHAHA. eventually, he did kiss me – with tongue. i enjoyed it so much i asked if we could do it again after i came back from my vacation. 

pagkabalik ko, nagkita kami. naghanap ng private na lugar kasi halangan naman sa harapan ng madla kami maghalikan. akala ko laplapan lang. nagulat ako parang a few minutes? seconds? into kissing, inangat niya damit ko at kung ano-ano na nangyari.

everything happened so fast, i didn't have time to process ANYTHING. hinawakan niya ako, hinubaran, nilabasan at pinakitaan ng tite. the only time he verbally asked me for my consent was when he wanted me to give him a blowjob, to which i said no. 

pagkatapos niyang labasan, umalis siya agad kasi he had to go to church. naiwan ako don sa kwarto, nakahiga, nakatulala. i don't remember much about what transpired while we were doing whatever the fuck we were doing, but i do clearly recall feeling disgusted about myself. 

dahil ""mahal"" ko, ginaslight ko sarili ko na normal lang yun. ako naman nag-aya makipag-halikan kaya dapat inexpect ko na rin na may kapkapan. atsaka nasa edad na rin naman ako kako kaya ok lang. finally, may ""experience"" na ako.

so pinanindigan ko for a few more months. ang nasa utak ko, wala naman siyang maling ginawa kasi hindi naman ako humindi.

maraming beses umulit yung ganitong sitwasyon – yung hindi naman ako nag-eenjoy pero tuloy lang para sa kanya. mabilis kasi siyang mahorny 'pag magkasama kami, pero ako hindi. inisip ko na lang it was my duty to satisfy him. 

nagsimula lang kami mag-away when i started saying, ""no"" at pinipilit pa rin niya. it was then na i realized i wasn't being respected in the relationship. pero matagal-tagal pa ulit bago ako nakapag-bounce. 

siguro my question lang talaga is, is it my fault for not communicating enough during the first stages of our relationship? do i have the right to feel violated kahit technically nakisakay naman ako by not saying no? or sadyang mismatch lang talaga kami dahil mataas libido niya at ako hindi?",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/110ytat/discussions_about_consent/,t2_vgkzcl42,1676260815.0
"Tama ba naging decision ko, or sayang yung pagkakataon?","So yun na nga, I experienced this back in 2012. Tagal na diba? Naalala ko lang kasi nakakabasa ako ng mga stories about public transportation.

And we all know na sobrang siksikan na sa train kapag dumaan na ng Monumento station. Sa Balintawak station, nakatayo ka na nyan pero you can find a perfect spot parin where you want to stand.

So yun na nga, I decided to position in front of the train door. Tapos pag dating ng monumento station, nag mamadali na lahat pumasok and there was this girl that caught my attention. Kasi sobrang lagkit ng tingin nya sakin as she passed by me, without blinking her eye. 

Maputi sya, probably around 5’3” in height. Base on my estimate, mga 36 cup C. Again estimate ko lang.

Sa gitna sya pumunta, hindi ko na sya pinansin after she passed by, kasi sa araw araw na sakay ko sa train, sanay na ako sa flow. After a couple more station plus more people coming in.. I decided to move nalang sa middle para maiwasan yung siksikan. When I stopped at the middle, someone looked at me ng malagkit. And I remembered na she’s the girl who passed by me dun sa monumento station.

And trust me, I’m good at staring, but shes better. Hindi nya talaga inaalis yung lagkit ng tingin nya, that I need to look somewhere else para mawala yung awkwardness that I felt. Pareho kaming nakatayo since siksikan. Then suddenly, she change her position, sideways, na yung left hand nya sakto sa private part ko. And she’s slowly touching my p*nis. Every movement ng train, na parang it’s not intentional. But whenever I look at her, she’s giving me the eye contact.

I’m 19 years old during that time, sex is not new to me. I had past experiences but not that much. So grabe yung kaba ko nung time na yun. She looks like in her mid 20’s. Then nung nakaupo na sya, she is still giving me the eye contact.

Tapos nasakto pa na bumaba na sa UN yung katabi nya, tapos ako na yung uupo. Since nasa harap lang nya ako. She’s intentionally bumping her boobs sa shoulders ko and she’s acting like she is looking somewhere. People in-front are already staring at us.  I can feel her fvcking boobs. Soft as I want to grab it and play with it. But I’m to afraid and shy to make my move baka ma humiliate ako or ma kasuhan ng sexual harassment.

Pag dating sa EDSA station, she whispered something in my ear. She said “Ano ba yan, hina mo naman.” Then bumaba na sya.


Wahahahahaha. Tama ba yung choice ko to not make a move? Minsan iniisip ko sayang din. Ahahaha",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/11kqowe/tama_ba_naging_decision_ko_or_sayang_yung/,t2_jih7obk8,1678167943.0
My Fuck-et List,"I'll just start this off by saying that I could credit my marupokpok self thanks to [1] catching my parents in a primal scene back in Grade 1, and [2] getting hooked early on to anime, manga, doujinshi, fanfics and hentai.

And now that I'm a medical intern, I've only become less sensitised, and more open to trying more in an attempt to satiate my sexual appetite. Though I can still appreciate a romantic, vanilla experience 😍

Without further ado, here is my Fuck-et list! Some of these I've already managed to do 😉 and this'll probably continue to lengthen haha

Trauma Response Kinks,"TRIGGER WARNING: Sexual Assault, Harassment, Molestation, Rape. 

Very fucked up post ahead.

DISCLAIMER: This is NOT an open invitation. 

I’ve always been a lurker in this subreddit. This became somehow of an escape for me. I’d visit it every night but today is different; out of impulse, I decided to share my own f*cked up set of kinks. If you know me, no you don’t.

I wouldn’t say I’ve always been molested in the past or had an incredibly traumatic sexual past, but I have a fair share of experiences that helped shape my current sexual kinks. There’s not a day I don’t think about them.

I frequently get catcalled or stared down as I walk the streets. It did infuriate me in the past, but now I see it differently. If I no longer get catcalled or stared at, I feel like at that day I wasn’t that pretty. This resulted in my constant need of validation from both sexes. 

So voila, my praise kink is born. 

Next, back when I was in 6th grade, I experienced my first overnight with cousins from my paternal side. It was a big family and a big house, most of my cousins were female. One of our older cousins encouraged us to stay late and alert, as our other cousin’s husband was notorious for being a peeping tom. Interestingly, I didn’t really feel fazed by it. Looking back, it’s fucked up to peek on a 6th grader as she’s taking a shower but strangely enough, I liked the thought of being watched while fully exposed. 

Tada! She’s an exhibitionist. 

Back when I was in 7th grade, I bought soft serve ice cream from a well-known local mall. There were a lot of people that night. I can’t forget what kuya server told me as I licked the ice cream: “Lamia nimo mutilap ma’am uy.” I felt so embarrassed and disgusting about myself. Months and years went on and I realized I’m kind of into it. It’s hard to explain the correlation between them, but I considered this as

My awakening to degradation kink. 

From grade school until senior high school, I’ve had admirers here and there. Some more obsessed than others. Throughout my teenage years, I’ve had 3 stalkers (that I know of). I’ve also known of 2 others who apparently made cum tributes to my profile pictures. I felt violated, but I also felt incredibly appreciated; desired. Those guys had photos of me saved in their phones, would follow me around places, and would text me using unknown numbers. I loved feeling wanted. I’m not sure if there’s a name for this, so I’ll keep it generic.

Lo and behold, an obsession or yandere kink is born. 

In grade 10, I had my first serious relationship. It was an INCREDIBLY toxic one, but most of my sexperiences was with that person - which is why we lasted for a year despite the tumultuous state of our connection. That person was possessive and super jealous, but I like that in a relationship. I remember how that person would threaten anyone who dared to flirt with me, they were NOT light threats too. 

That’s not all, that person would blackmail me that they’d leak my nudes if I don’t respond to their messages. Then after the explosive fight, they’ll send me food with some sweet note. Just the extremes, really. The ultimate highs and lows. 

I think this is on the REALLY fucked up part of the spectrum, but I found it really arousing to have someone act that crazy and desperate because of me. 

Ever since then, a jealousy/possessive kink has been a top tier kink of mine.

I’ve always liked commuting, but there was a time that I didn’t. I’d remember how I would use my books as a barricade if I ever sat beside a sketchy-behaving guy. I’ve been molested and touched non-consensually in public transport and malls before. Multiple times. Also in gatherings, when guy friends subtly touch you in unusual places. They’d try to be sly about it, but I knew what they were trying to do all along, I’d act pretty dumb about it because I was enjoying it too (I was single at the time). To be specific, it was always my thighs and butt. 

I still have my reservations on this kink, but when I was back to being single, when I commuted and my skin subtly meets the skin of the stranger beside me and they don’t pull away, it was CRAZY sexual tension. It aroused me enough to make me squeeze my legs. As a loyal patron of Japanese porn, groping plots in a train setting was one of my go-to videos to get myself off so that I could sleep.

Achievement Unlocked: Groping and molestation kink.

Though I’ve already discovered this next kink before, one recent experience of mine heightened my arousal for this fantasy. I’ve recently been betrayed by a close friend of mine during a party. I was drunk as hell and they insisted to make out with me. I declined for who knows how long, it was a never-ending back and forth of them convincing me and me stating out reasons as to why I’m not interested and that a NO is a NO. 

They were sober, I was flat out drunk - but sane enough to not ruin the friendship and make a decision I’d regret. They pinned me down on the bed, I was absolutely powerless. I have no idea how I survived that night without getting r*ped, but I somehow did. 

Having a dominant personality, I’m used to positions of power and leadership. I’m used to being in control and having it MY WAY. It was always MY WAY or the highway. I think this is why I find this kink so interesting, because I’m not used to it. I kind of liked the idea of not having power, not having control, being taken advantage of, just straight up dominated. 

I’m a switch, but in my past relationships, I was always the top. My first ex had an intimidating aura as well, but loved having me in control when we were in bed. My second ex had a low libido and was just super vanilla. In our years of serious relationship, we only did it thrice. I’ve only recently explored how it feels to be submissive, and I want MORE. 

There’s a reason why this kink, despite being controversial, is a crowd-favorite.

The kink I hold close and dear to my heart, CNC or Consensual Non-Consent.

May it be:
Sleeping CNC - fucked while you’re sleeping
Free Use - pretty self explanatory 
R*pe roleplay - my favorite 🫠
Blackmail CNC
Jealousy/Anger Fucking

You name it, as long as it fits under CNC, I’ll do it in a heartbeat. Use me however you like 😩

Accidental free live show P2,"Part 2 [nito](https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/s/eWGtqyYZmJ)

So ito na nga! Dahil may free time na ko😂. If I get a hundred for every redditor who asked for an update, may pang-haul na ko ng sports bra! Hahahahaha

Medyo mahaba sorry. Part 2 kasi ang daming nakapansin nung sinabi ko na it wasn't the first time that my cousin saw me naked.

First of, we're not cousins by blood, ha. Bakit sabihin niyo incest kami. No fucking way😭. My stepdad is his uncle. So no sweet home alabang dito. Medj lang.

So here's the story.

Let's call my cousin, Rhet. Around jhs, friend na kami ng Rhet. Same section kasi kami and hindi pa magkakilala tito nya and mama ko. We became friends, closer than anyone else in the group. Kami rin reason bakit nagkakilala uncle nya and mama ko, ganon kami ka close😂. We became M.Us din if you know what it meant. It wasn't a secret in the family and our friends.

We made out here and there (as horny teenagers). He was the first guy I did it with, because all I had was girlfriends. First sex ko rin babae. We all thought I was lesbian. We haven't gone to penetration aside sa simple finger and blowjob.

Worst place we did it is sa likod ng school na walang tao during lunch break. Have't mentioned, sa catholic school pala kami nag aaral. Sorry, Lord. Malapit kasi sa chapel yun😭. Muntik pa kami mahuli.

We were together for like 2 years, not until we just fell apart and started dating other people. We're still close asf. Dito na rin kami naging mag pinsan kasi kasal na mom ko and uncle nya😂. It was known sa family na we were together, kasi one time during a family gathering nahuli kami ng uncle nya na nagmo-momol inside his room (which he shares with his brother that time). Inaasar pa nga kami. 

11th grade came, we moved in sakanila. Kasi kasal na mom ko. We're still friends, nothing changed aside sa no more momols hahaha, although pag magkakasama kami may green jokes and sexual innuendos from him. 

Sooo, for those who were asking when was the first time he saw me naked — which he didn't during our momols, eto na.

Day 1 of moving in, since naninibago pa sa lahat, I took a shower sa common C.R kasi may tao sa cr sa kwarto namin. Grade 11 na ko nito, so my body is kind of fully grown + I used to work out. Eh hindi ko pa masyadong kabisado yung bahay, and iniisip ko wala naman papasok kasi may kaniya kaniya naman cr yung mga kwarto AND HINDI KO GETS YUNG LOCK THAT TIME😭 as an ignorante diko mafigure out pano yung lock, so akala ko nakalock na.

I was in the middle of shower nung nag open yung door. Walang harang yung toilet sa shower so pag open ako agad yung kita. Nung pagkaopen, nagkatinginan lang kami. Shock ako kasi pota malay ko ba kung sino😭. I cannot forget that day, mga whole 10  seconds atah kami nagkatinginan. Tapos sinabihan ko sya “anong hinihintay mo? Di ka lalabas?”. Kuya boy did not go out💀. Instead, he went inside and LOCKED THE DOOR. Mukhang bagong gising lang sya kasi nanliit pa mata. Umiling lang si gago tapos umupo sa toilet seat.

Nilakihan ko lang sya ng mata tapos tinuloy ko na maligo. The whole time he was just watching. Ramdam na ramdam ko yung titig niya, mga ate girl. Medyo nagflash back sakin mga gawain namin nung jhs, and i kinda missed it so slightly nag init ako that time pero strong ako so no🙄. Pagtapos ko maligo, pumunta ako sa banda nya para kunin towel. Bale medyo nakaharap ako sakaniya. Di atah nakapagpigil si anteh, pinalo ako sa pwet tapos pinisil😭.

Malapit na ko bumigay, pero di talaga. So lumabas na ko agad and nag me time sa kwarto 🫢.

It wasn't the only timeee. Remember when I said I usually don't care about my surroundings pag nagbbihis? Pag nagsswimming kami and need ko magpalit, kahit nasa kwarto sya and other cousins, di na ko nag aabala lumabas or magtago. Pero di naman sobrang exposed. 

Meron din na nagbibihis ako sa kwarto, tapos pumasok sya nonchalantly dire diretso tapos humiga sa kama ko. While I was naked from head to foot, still dressing myself. I let him because it doesn't bother me and I don't feel harassed or anything. If I am, I'd tell him naman and he'd back off asap.

Someone here told me I might be an exhibitionist, but I don't really know. Maybe I am, maybe I am not hahaha. Sorry na ang haba😂.",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/17suf0k/accidental_free_live_show_p2/,t2_cd9v2xqu9,1699709425.0
Legit massage turned slightly sensual,"Before anything else, sensual lang ha. Hindi naman sexual or anything. M here pala, just so you know. 

So I went to this legit massage place. I won't tell na lang the name kasi chain siya and madaming branches.

It's been a while na din since I got I to a massage place or spa. If you've been reading my previous posts, you'll know na rin why since I can get massages naman anytime. This time, ayokong mang abala at gusto ko lang din ng massage talaga.

When I got there, walang ibang tao. Off peak hours kasi ito. The receptionist asked if I have a reservation or appointment, sabi ko wala. And then they asked me if I have a preferred therapist. Sabi ko wala naman kasi first time ko sa branch. So they made me wait. Kinuha ko pala yung signature massage nila, yung mga 90 minutes para medyo matagal. 

Then the therapist approached me. She's older than me, pero I think she's just on her thirties. Like I said, I was in for a legitimate massage. Hindi ko naman siya iniscout or anything.  

She washed my foot then she asked me if nakapag pa massage na ako dun. Sabi ko not yet and it's my first time sa branch na yun. She jokingly said na ""sir dito ka na lagi magpa massage"". 

Afterwards, dun na kami sa massage room. Usual massage bed na may butas. Parang couple room lang siya na may curtain sa gitna. Since ako lang yung tao, walang laman yung isa. I noticed na walang shorts sa bed, kaya I asked kung ano ba dapat suot? Sabi nya ""puwede naman po kayo mag shorts sir may shorts po kami dito, puwede rin pong underwear lang or kahit saan po kayo comfortable"". 

I won't lie, I would really prefer to be massaged naked. So I asked kung ok lang mag alis ng underwear? She said ""ok lang po Sir"".  I think medyo natawa siya ng konti. Ewan. 

When she came back, nakatapis lang ako ng towel sitting on the edge of the bed. She said, sige Sir dapa po kayo. Ang hirap describe paano ako dumapa but kahit anong cover ko, I'm sure she saw my butt kasi paano ako dadapa diba. Ok lang naman sa akin yun kasi pag massage naman talaga, yung puwet e namamasahe. 

She then covered me with a linen sheet Tapos she removed the towel under. Then usual massage lang sa back..

Nung ieexpose na nya yung butt ko to massage my lower back, nagulat ako kasi ang ""baba"" nung pagtanggal nya ng cover. As in buong puwet ko exposed haha. Usually kasi diba kalahati lang? Pero since I chose to be naked, I thought sige baka ganun talaga. 

Her hands glided across my back all the way down to my butt. Ang naging sensual part for me was she was gliding her hands all the way down. As in yung tip ng fingers nya nasa ibaba na ng butt ko and she was basically palming my entire butt. Ilang hagod din yun. 

Honestly, hindi ko inexpect but I was getting turned on. I know puwedeng harassment ito or something, pero honestly, I've been really comfortable with nudity. Ok lang ito sa akin. I actually like it kasi hindi ko inexpect. 

Eventually natapos na dun. She began massaging my legs naman. Nakadapa pa ako. Nagulat ulit ako kasi medyo ni spread apart nya yung thighs ko. Hindi naman super pero since I was naked nga, medyo na feel ko na exposed ako dun haha. 

Covered ang butt ko dito by the towel. She was massaging the back of my thighs and my inner thighs din. I'm not sure baka iniimagine ko lang, pero nararamdaman ko na tumama ulit yung fingers nya sa balls ko. One time medyo napa flinch ako kasi nagulat ako and she asked me if I was OK. Sabi ko naman ok lang. It wasn't intentional na she was touching it, pero yung ""accidental"" na pag tama nung fingers nya, nakaka turn on. 

Eventually, she asked me to turn around and lie on my back. Kabado ako dito kasi semi hard ako. She lifted up one side of the sheet Yung away from me) and she asked me to turn around. I covered my dick and balls with my hands as I lay on my back. Tapos I ""arranged"" my penis sa gitna kasi yun nga, medyo naka erect siya ng konti.  

Then nag proceed na ulit siya sa usual massage. May move siya na delikado. Bale she positioned my thigh na parang pa L shape, yung nakabukaka with knees bent. Pero one leg lang. Seryoso nung pag galaw nya nun, may sumilip talaga sa kumot. I'm sure napansin nya kasi she rearranged the kumot e. Nag massage ulit siya ng front and inner thighs ako, again yung dulo naman daliri nya, hanggang singit. Eto sure ako na tumatama talaga dahil it's right beside her hands e. 

Tapos may move siya na yung legs na naka bent, she will twist to the opposite side of my body para ma crack yung spine ko. In the process, talagang exposed na yung buong likod ko kasi i was twisting to the other side e. Pero ang sarap kasi it really cracked my back. Actually when she returned my leg, gulo gulo na naman ang kumot. Hindi ko na alam if nakatakip pa rin ba ako. Basta, masarap. 

Ginawa nya ulit yun pero sa other leg ko naman. Same thing lang. 

Then she proceeded with the usual massage na. So far unremarkable na naman after. 

After ng massage, she game me a ginger tea and hot towel. She asked me if ok daw ba yung massage. Sabi ko oo masarap. Sabi nya sir next time try mo yung body scrub. I asked her kung puwedeng siya ulit yung therapist dun, sabi nya ""oo naman sir basta ako ang irerequest mo sa receptionist namin"".  

Tinanong ko pala ulit kung kailangan ba naka shorts or underwear sa body scrub. Sabi nya yung iba daw kasi nahihiya kaha naka disposable underwear. Pero kung saan daw ako comfortable.  

Parang gusto ko tuloy magpa body scrub na. Haha. Kaso bawal ata pag bagong massage, dapat before Haha. Try natin next time. 

Ayun. It felt good. Legit din yung massage talaga. Mukhang babalik ako. Haha.",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/11kvipu/legit_massage_turned_slightly_sensual/,t2_phue5owv,1678184588.0
Is it weird that I don't like dick pics?,"If you think this is an invitation, it is not.

If you think that this is just some clickbait for you to read my post, it is not.

If you think that I'm just using reverse psychology to subtly suggest that you should send me one, I'm not.


I really don't like dick pics. And I don't know if it's something I share with other people here, so I'm curious to know people who share the same sentiments.

I'm legitimately curious if there are some ladies/non-cis men that don't like receiving dick pics.

There's something about dick pics that irks me, but staring at them in person and not touching them is completely fine with me. 

Whatever way it is, or how it looks like, I'm completely fine with looking at it in person than in pictures.

I mean this in any given context:

Even if I am completely aware that this person will send me a dick pic, and I like this person enough to want to fuck him, there's nothing about receiving a dick pic that piques my curiosity that would get me excited to receive it. I really don't look forward to it. Sometimes, I'm just polite enough to accept it but never have I felt excited to see it. I don't look at it and say ""meh"", but I delete it on my end as soon as I receive it.

Someone asked me, *""Do you fake your reaction when you see it?""*

I honestly don't. I usually ask what they'd wanna do to me after I've received it. But I don't really react to it and fake an amused response. Like ""oh my god, it's huge."" Or ""it's so yummy."" Or ""I want that in my mouth.""

So, I'd just divert that ""energy"" into his ""verbal expression"" of why he's hard.
Why he's excited. Why he'd wanna ram it inside.


*Is it because it had become ""normal"" for me to see it because of how frequent I've had sex in my past relationships? That I've seen different shapes and sizes and skin tones and baldness or bushiness around it enough to seeing one had lost its spark?*

When I think about it, even before I've been sexually active, seeing a penis  doesn't make me uncomfortable or blush. I haven't been exposed to it too early, but I already understood back then that there's nothing wrong with seeing one unless someone else reacts negatively to it.

Same thing with someone else seeing mine, I'd only know it's ""wrong"" if an adult reacts to it with shock or anger. This is of course when we're toddlers. Too young to understand what else it's for other than peeing.

I've seen other penises of people whom I haven't been intimate with when I go to hospital duties. I'd help them dress up. I'd insert their catheters. I've given them medication around/near the area. They'd get excited, but I'd laugh it off.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not disgusted by it.

I love how different they look like just like our vulvas.

I have a ""database"" of penises in my head and I have an imaginary trophy room in it and all the best ones are kept in the trophy room. LOL 

There are some guys whom I have unintentionally offended when I tell them ""No. You don't have to show me your dick."" when we're getting raunchy through chats. They get offended even if I've told them that I don't like dick pics. ""I thought you were kidding."" would be their usual response and I'd have to put out the fire by explaining how I'm not amused by getting photographs of penises.


Is it me? Am I the problem?


The weird thing is, like what I've told you here before on AJ, that the unexpected things turn me on more.

*Like pictures of the curls of your thick head of hair.*

*Your feet on a pillow.*

*Your smile while you enjoy your iced coffee.*

*The Yeezy 350s on the carpet just after you've taken them off.*

*A wet towel next to the shower.*

*A worn t-shirt hanging on a treadmill.*

*The bulge of your semi-hard dick while you wear those gray sweatpants.*

*Your glistening fingertip as you show me the precum you wiped off from the head of your cock.*


Those things make me horny.
Those things make my mind wander.
Those things make my mouth water.


But when you show me your dick, even when it's hard, engorged, and veiny.
I'd rather have you describe it to me than show me through a pic.

Knowing that I write stories about my experiences and knowledge about sex and other topics related, you'd think I'd be receiving a bachelorette party amount of dicks in my inbox. I rarely get any. LOL. AND I AM GLAD.

I am truly grateful you don't send me any. It's quite funny and kind at the same time. That even I don't plaster on a sign that I don't like dick pics and not send them to me, I don't get any.

The occasional abs pics, yes, I get those. But dick pics? RARELY.

Some ask me, ""You seem open minded. I like how straightforward you are, would you rate my dick?""

And when I say, ""No, I don't really like dick pics. I'm sorry.""

They don't harass me and get mad.

They just apologize and stop messaging.

I am glad that these perverts know when to walk away. LOL

*What about videos? I guess those are different?*

No. I don't get turned on by those. LOL

I'd probably connect a headset and just listen to the moaning than watch the video.

Even masturbating videos don't make me horny.
That's why I never enjoyed videocalls and mutual masturbation.
I immediately get dry. Pussy just dries up like SpongeBob going to Sandy's without a fishbowl on his head.

*pinky up*

If I really had to do it, I'd find a place in my head, tap to it, and close my eyes.
And just visualize me watching him in person. I'm there doing it. Only then I'd be wet again.

I'm a creative and visuals would be something that I should be in touch of.
But in this case, to compare a penis to art, I'd rather understand what the art is about, than how it looks like.

The passion, the emotions, the feelings that drove the ""artist"" to create the ""art"".

But even if I'm pretty sure about how I feel about dick pics, I sometimes wonder if it is weird or unusual. Since I've never encountered people like me, who doesn't like seeing dick pics.

If we're alike, I'd love to know your explanation as to why you don't like them. I would love to know.",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/ypqix5/is_it_weird_that_i_dont_like_dick_pics/,t2_ixqbp61r,1667923445.0
Confessions of a Reddit Pussynommer - Don't make it weird,"Trigger warning: Abuse of power. Office politics. Harassment.

I think I need to dedicate a few sentences to some...considerations I am asking from the reader in this story. I'm male, and while I see myself as progressive and I understand that what happened to me is bad, the way I relay my story may not reflect that for reasons that may or may not be obvious soon enough. I guess what I'm trying to say is that if the genders were reversed, the story will be a lot lot lot darker 😶

So in my twenties I worked in a BPO. Trainer so feeling rockstar ng konti. Unlike myself now and the typical BPO worker reputation, I was not sleeping around. You could say I was a bit uptight and straight laced. 

Except for a few months. This was how I was bullied into being a boy toy.

See as a trainer, we had a lot of interactions with our foreign clients. Directors, managers etc. We were not only expected to work with them but to socialize with them. One of these clients was Diya (name changed obviously). She was the training director for a global bank. Indian American. Long dark hair. Late 30s. Very slim. Hawkish features. Not unattractive but severe would be a good way to describe her looks. She was very social and was fond of turning meetings into social events and back.

Now a thing about me is that I don't drink. I've generally relaxed on this but back then you could never get me to drink. I hated it. I hated the taste, I hated how I felt and I hated itching afterwards

One time in an upscale bar that the company closed for Diya and our team, she handed me a drink and was being jolly and said I should drink with everyone. I politely declined. She pushed a bit and I told her I itchy severely. She insisted. I told her she's not gonna make me. I said this in front of everybody. I thought I delivered it in a jovial but convincing manner. She didn't take it that way

After that night she decided I was her personal ""project""

Diya would show up unannounced in my training classes and ""provide feedback"" to me in front of my trainees. She would single me out in meetings with high level questions, some I wasn't even in the pay grade to answer. Ad hoc tasks. She was this constant stressful presence to the point that while my direct bosses noticed the bullying they were not able to do anything. Some of my bosses jokingly told her to stop giving me a hard time during meetings to no effect. She was a client. The company needed her happy.

So I suffered. I even considered leaving and prepped my resume.

One Friday I received an email. Another invite from Diya asking the team to meet at a hotel restaurant for her boss' surprise birthday celebration. I shuddered mentally. Not another night of her bullying me in front of everybody. She specifically asked me to bring a bottle of Baileys which I had to pay out of pocket at that time

Shet

I get the restaurant in the evening and waited. And waited. I texted my boss and she said the celebration happened that afternoon. The color drained from my face and I thought I screwed up. Monday is gonna suuuuuck.

 I was about to leave when Diya showed up. I babbled an apology saying that the email said 8 pm when she cut me off. ""Are you saying I gave you the wrong time?"" She said sharply. I stammered. She leaned close to my ear. She gave me a room key card. Asked me to show up there in 30 minutes

Panic-mode me couldn't make heads and tails of what's going on

I got to the room. Knocked. No answer. I used the room key and there was Diya sitting on a chair next to the bed. The lights were off except for the desklamps.  She asked me to sit on the bed.It felt like walking into the mouth of the beast.

She told me she gave me the wrong time on purpose. She said I can stop pretending and I knew what was gonna happen (I honestly didn't)

She told me not to make it weird

My mouth was dry. Her mouth devoured mine. She tasted like whiskey.

She asked me to unbutton her blouse. My hands were shaking and fumbled the buttons. 

SMACK

My cheek burned. My vision flashed white. Her mouth found mine again and her teeth were sharp. 

SMACK AGAIN

I ripped her blouse open. The buttons soundlessly bouncing off the carpet. She growled and was suddenly on top of me. Her nails digging into my skin through my clothes

She straddled me and she reached behind her to unhook her bra. She grabbed me by the hair and guided me to her breasts. my mouth was on her nipples. They were rock hard. She commanded me to bite them. Harder. Harder.

SMACK

She stood up and started taking off the rest of her clothes. She asked me to get naked as well and to sit in the bed with my back against the pillows and the head board. She picked up the bottle of Baileys from the floor. She cracked the cap open and poured a shot into a glass. she drank the shot and straddled me again

Her skin was seething hot, especially between her legs. I can feel her nether lips, slick and wet on my belly. She leaned forward and kissed me again. I was not expecting the stream of creamy, hot liquor she spit into my mouth. She held me still as her mouth was locked with hers, forcing me to drink it all

She laughed afterwards

She grabbed my hair again and she shoved her pussy against my mouth. She was so smooth. ""Stick your tongue out!,"" She commanded with a low growl and proceeded to rub her engorged clit against my tongue. I felt my chin wet, from her and from my saliva. She used my mouth so slowly. I had to manage the strain of my jaw and breathing. All this time I was grabbing the sheets as everytime I held on to her she would slap my hands away

And she came, starting out with tiny shudders that rolled into a bigger one, her inner thighs quivering at the end

We fucked several times that night and was probably the first time I could say I FUCKED and lost control. She taught me so much and showed me so much.

Once, as I was pounding her, she wrapped her legs around me and whispered ""fuck me like you hate me"". And I did. And she met me thrust for thrust til I came inside her

On the same night she took me in her mouth. No pretense of gentleness or shame. Her eyes were locked into mine the entire time. I tried to push her away as I came but she held me down. I've never been so sexually helpless than that moment. As I was quivering from my orgasm, she crawled over me and kissed me, her mouth still full of my cum. I hissed angrily but her hands held my face still

Again she laughed

In the morning, the Diya I knew was back. Our conversation was almost formal. Don't make it weird. I will not get a promotion out of this. Nothing will change in the office. I could only nod.

And she will see me again

The relationship lasted for about 6 months. 6 months where I was on edge. Everytime she was in Manila she called. She would torture me in the office and in bed. She was very good at making sure she never left any visible marks. She never tried anything sexual at work.

Diya taught me to pay attention to a woman's body, how she reacts to my touch, my kisses. She taught me to get what I wanted from my partner but to also make sure she got what she wanted from me. 

I never harbored the illusion that I was the only one. She implied as much when we would talk idly. She didn't cuddle. And one day I see a company email congratulating her on her new title and I never heard from her again

I sometimes wonder what I really felt, or even what I feel now about that time. Did I enjoy it? Obviously. Did I hate it? Yes. Did I take anything away from the experience? It was an awakening for sure

I can't help thinking how much different I would be now if things played out differently

I wonder how she is now

All I know is if we ever meet again, I won't make it weird",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/14q61ps/confessions_of_a_reddit_pussynommer_dont_make_it/,t2_uyvdsse5,1688448881.0
Taking Advantage of a Drunk Girl,"Update edit Part 2 is out:  

[https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/e2y2ck/taking\_advantage\_of\_a\_drunk\_girl\_part\_2\_the\_dinner/](https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/e2y2ck/taking_advantage_of_a_drunk_girl_part_2_the_dinner/) 

\--------------------------------------------------------

As usual with every BPO/Call Center company in Metro Manila, a big party is celebrated whenever it's the anniversary of the company. And obviously free flowing alcohol is present along with some bands performing and a dance floor with a DJ after the bands.

I personally don't like going to these parties for 2 reasons. one, I'm an extreme introvert and two, I can't drink alcohol (I have a fatal allergic reaction to liquor). But it's mandated by the company that all managers and above are required to attend the party and ""supervise"" the agents or ""kids"" so that they don't do something too stupid while drunk in the party.

Anyhow, so there I was on the party, just chilling, socializing with my co-managers while drinking punch/juice. Roaming around the place, I can see most of the guys are chugging beer like there's no tomorrow. Then, in one of the tables I saw one group of ladies (about 3) and 2 gays calling out my name. So, I approached them and recognized that they were one team in the account that I formerly managed/helped during their transition period.

One of the ladies in the group (let's call her Aya) is really my type (chinita, slim with braces and glasses) and some folks in the office knows that I have a huge crush on her. She was wearing this elegant jade dress with a deep cleavage cut and side cuts on the skirt. She looked amazingly beautiful and sexy that night. Anyhow, the group asked me to seat in their table and they kinda forced me to sit beside Aya.

Of course I felt a little awkward and comfortable to be sitting beside her and the group keeps on teasing me on her. At first I didn't notice that Aya was already drunk as her cheeks were reddish and pinkish from the bottles of beer she drank. At this time the dance floor was already open and the DJ started playing club music.

The group was excited to go and dance and as I was starting to stand up and leave their group, I got caught off guard when Aya asked me to dance with her. At first I didn't want to because a. I'm shy and torpe around her b. I don't dance that well. But, I mustered enough courage to join her on the dance floor.

When we were on the dance floor, I really knew that she was really drunk already (I could smell alcohol from her breath). Anyhow, we started to dance normally then (we were like 3-5 feet apart), then DJ changed the music into a sexy-club kind of music and she stared into me with a playful look in her eyes and she motioned her hands for me to come closer to her.

Then I was surprised that she started dancing sensually/sexually around me I can't really describe it but she was making her boobs touch me, then her hips/butt would touch my crotch area. At this point, I was really getting hard down there na and I also tried doing the same to her but just sensually caressing my hands around her hips and stomach area (I didn't want to get caught/seen doing sexual harassment lol.)

After a while of dancing, Aya whispered into my ear.

""Sir Tatsuya, I'm tired na and I want to go home, but I'm too drunk and scared to book a grab going home alone. The group told me that we're both from Las Pinas naman,  can you please drive me home?""

And I said. ""Sure Aya, I don't want anything bad to happen to you naman. I'll drive you home""

So, both of us were leaving the building na, we have to take the elevator going down to the basement where I parked my car. It was a little silent during that time. When we got out of the elevator in the parking area we heard sounds. a girl moaning. we looked around and saw that there's this extremely drunk couple/agents passionately kissing on one corner of the parking area. I just shook my head and laughed and Aya laughed too.

Anyhow, as we were walking towards my car. The car parked next to me (fortuner) started to shake and we can see hand prints on the windows. Of course me and Aya knew what was going on and we just looked at each other and smiled. As both of us got seated on the car and I started it up she said:

""Uy, Thank you Sir Tatsuya for doing this ah. I don't normally do this with guys that I don't trust""

I just smiled at her and said that ""No problem and you're welcome Aya, thank you for trusting me.""

So, with that we left the building and started the drive going home. While driving, the music that was playing in the car was jazz, which is my usual playlist when driving at night. I was surprised to know that Aya also liked jazzy music.

When we were at SLEX and going up to Skyway one sensual jazz track started playing and I was really surprised when I felt Aya's hand on my thigh. Then I glanced at her, her face was all flush, her cheeks reddish, still very drunk and she was looking at me naughtily and she said:

""You know Sir Tatsuya, I have a confession to make. I really liked you. You were so helpful and patient with managing and leading me and the team during our transition. I was hoping that I can pay you back for what you did""

As she was saying this, her hand started to inch closer towards my crotch and I can feel myself getting hot and hard again. I have to say I'm having a hard time concentrating on driving while this was happening lol. Anyhow, I decided to tell her the truth as well.

""Thank you Aya, to tell you the truth I really liked. no I really, badly want you. The reason why I did all of those to you and your team was to be closer to you. Because you're amazingly cute, talented/smart, pretty and well tonight, hot and sexy."" I smiled playfully back at her.

When I said this, her hand was already rubbing on my crotch and she leaned from her seat towards to me and said.

""I want you to fuck me tonight. Hard. Don't you know that I'm already wet now?""

She grabbed my right hands and she guided it under her dress, and from her panties I felt that indeed it was already wet. I was already hot, hard and started to sweat when she said that and I felt her there.

But I don't know why, but I always have a hard rule/principle to never take advantage of a woman, that's intoxicated/drunk or un-conscious. It just never felt right for me. Being a gentleman and my good conscience taking over the moment said.

""I'm sorry Aya, I can't. As much as I badly want you. You're drunk and you're not thinking straight. I don't want to take advantage over you. I just doesn't feel right.""

But then Aya said. ""Aww, really Sir? Don't you want this?""

(she started to take off the upper part of her dress and bra, exposing her breasts and slightly lifted her legs and removed her panties then she started to rub her pussy and grab her boobs at the same time.)

To be honest that was the hardest point in my life, I could have easily given in and just fucked her at the moment. But still, I held my ground and said firmly to her.

""I'm really sorry Aya but no, I can't do this. When you're sober na tomorrow then we can talk about this. But not now.""

She just continued to play with herself, moaning until she reached climax/orgasm. Then she went silent on her seat.

She was half asleep and still very drunk, when we arrived at her house. Since she couldn't walk or stand anymore, I asked for her apartment keys and opened it. I carried her (like a baby) from the car to her room. Looking at her, I just couldn't leave her in that state with her dress, so I decided to help her change clothes. Again not taking advantage over her. After getting her changed in a white shirt and pajamas, I let her drink water and some pills to help with the hang-over. I tucked her in bed and kissed her forehead. As I was leaving, I can hear her saying ""Thank you"" as I locked the door on her apartment and went home myself.

The next day in the office, I bumped into Aya during lunch break and she was blushing when she saw me. She asked:

""Sir Tatsuya, Thank you for helping me out last night. But I don't remember what happened. I just recall that you drove me home then I just woke up the next morning on my bed na. Please tell me what happened""

She doesn't remember anything that happened during the drive last night. I just smiled and told her:

""Ah, Aya you were sleeping soundly during the drive going home then I just helped you from your apartment to your room since you can't walk straight haha.""

She raised her eyebrows and replied:

""Really? Nothing happened? You didn't touch me or anything?""

I had a nervous look on my face but I said back:

""I promise/swear I didn't do that to you. You were asleep and drunk. I never take advantage of women.""

Then she finally said:

""Aww thank you Sir Tatsuya, you're such a gentleman, I knew I could trust you. I'll be on leave for the next couple of weeks but once I'm back would you like to have dinner with me at my apartment? I promise to re-pay you back for what you did for me"" She smiled cute-fully.

I just smiled and said.

""Sure I would love that and looking forward to it.""

FIERY PASSIONATE REVENGE,"This is a story about my vengance to a cheating gaslighting ex-boyfriend. I lured him into sex and insinuated a criminal offense that led him to his downfall.

Note: This is a long ass slowburn read as I don’t want to break this into multiple parts. If you want the juicy stuff, you can skip and go straight to ""Fuck Me"", ""Floozy"", and “Psycho” below.

**FLOWERS**

I met my ex in 2019. Let's call him Lex (not his real name).

Lex is a flamboyant and outgoing guy. He loves to be in the spotlight, enjoying admiration and attention from others. He is tall and moreno, but he would not stun you like how a conventionally attractive man would. His personality, however, would draw you in. 

He has a high self-regard which sometimes can come across as him being arrogant, but he also has this flair of making me feel cherished through grand romantic gestures (i.e., gifts and elaborate dates). 

Our sex was intense, passionate, and consistent during the first year rush. To maintain his sexual appetite, I collected and worn a fuckton of lingerie (about 200+), which was more than my regular and office outfit combined. He was pleased. In return, he'd frequently send me flowers for being his obedient submissive slut. It was highest of highs. Until...

**CHAOS ENSUES**

It was at the peak of the pandemic when everything started to fall apart and his true colors shone.

His side laundry business closed down. He couldn't keep up with the losses to the point where he started borrowing money from me. I didn't mind at first. I wanted to help him.

Meanwhile, I had to give up my condo to take care and live with my parents. My dad had Alzheimer’s; bedridden. As a bread winner, I supplied our house with medical equipment such as hospital beds, wheelchairs, oxygen tanks, etc. It’s the least I could do for my parents who raised me.  

With that setup, Lex and I rarely get to see (fuck) each other and we would argue most about money.

He tried to regain his finances through casino gambling. I supported him financially with the hope that all of the money will return. Boy, I was wrong.

He started to gaslight me when I couldn’t give him any more money. He said some things to me that I will never forget to this day (95% verbatim):

“Mas malaki sweldo mo sa ‘kin. Bakit ang damot mo?”

“Babayaran naman kita pag nanalo ako. Ang dami mo pang sinasabi.”

“Hindi mo man lang ako matulungan. Wala kang silbi.”

Shit got toxic. By this time, he owed me 340k.

**PITCH BLACK**

Both of my parents were hospitalized in the summer of 2021. My dad stayed in the ICU for a month and then my mom after. Until my dad passed away in our home, *in my arms*, while waiting for the ambulance.

I was screaming bawling in tears.

I called Lex to help me but a woman answered his phone and said “This is his gf. Who’s this?”

*That fucking asshole had the nerve to cheat on me! Just because I couldn't lend him any more money? Putanginang yan!*

He cheated on me the day I needed him the most. I couldn’t find it in my heart to forgive him. I broke up with him that same damn day.

And just when things can't get any worse, the promotion I was eyeing for at work has been rejected two days after.

I fell deep into the abyss of whirlwind emotions. I was grieving for the death of my father. I was angry at Lex for cheating on me and his unpaid debt. I was angry at myself for enabling him. I was discouraged when they declined my promotion. Honestly, I didn't know which emotion to feel first. 

The magnitude of setbacks took a toll on me and my mental health started to decline. Everything was dark to a point where I could not move. The constant feeling of being lethargic paralyzed me. I couldn’t get out of bed. I couldn’t eat. I didn’t shower for a week. It was the lowest of lows.

I was all alone taking care of things with no one to take care of me.

**GLIMMER**

One night, I received a call from an unusual friend. Let’s call him Rye. Lex has always been jealous of him because I trust Rye more than anyone in my life. I’ve known Rye since 2006.

It’s uncanny how Rye would randomly call me intuitively knowing that I’m in deep shit. It's as if he can feel that there's something wrong and he'd come to the rescue. A potential soulmate? I digress.

He's the only one I responded to from all the missed calls and messages in my phone. Oddly enough, he didn't give me sympathies. Instead, he reminded me of what I am capable of.

""Did you know that I find you alluring and daunting?” Rye said, trying to convince me to get my act together. “Your first revenge stunt in 2010 was glorious.”

“That’s more than a decade ago.” 

“All the more reason for this one to be explosive.” He responded sternly.

""Mabait na ako ngayon.""

""And look where it got you."" He paused and continued to say, ""You're not the kind who gives up a fight, right?"" *He mindfucks me and I love it!*

I realized na mahirap maging masyadong mabait. People will take advantage of you, walk over you and leave you weary. When you can't give them what they want, ikaw pa lolokohin. 

I've been simmering down in the darkness for too long until I saw a glimmer of hope.

I am determined to turn this fucking table around, light it up, and burn him to the ground!

**FUCK ME**

It takes a great amount of strategic thinking and patience to plot a revenge.

I'm so fueled by my anger, but I must be cautious. I needed Lex to talk to me to jumpstart my plan. What better way to lure him in than an invitation for sex. 

“Stressed ako, gusto ko labasan. Fuck me?”

“Sunduin kita. 7pm.” He replied instantly. He took the bait.

Rye called immediately right after, saying he's on his way to my house to meet me. I swear to God, his timing couldn't be more uncanny! Rye arrived first. I got inside his car just in time when Lex started to park in the driveway.

""Are you going to fuck him?"" Rye asked.

""I have to. Why? Do you want to fuck me?""

Rye turned his gaze at me. He stopped his car on the corner. His right hand extended to cup my face. His eyes widened as he leaned closer. ""You're cunningly beautiful, Mia. I want to fuck you before you embark on this journey, but only when you're ready.""

Rye knows how to keep me sane and grounded. He's the light of this long dark tunnel. I feel safe around him. I want to surrender in his presence at this moment.

I leaned forward to meet his kiss. The awful memories I've experienced with Lex melted into tears. Rye wiped my tears on the side while he passionately kissed me.

""Do you want me to stop?"" He asked.

""Please keep going.""

""Would you like to go somewhere comfortable?""

""I'd like you to drive back to my house.""

Now, I could easily summarize the next event that happened in 4 sentences but I won't, because this memory has ingrained in my head forever.

Lex is still parked by the driveway while Rye parked on the other side of the street.

""Fuck me, Rye."" 

Without hesitation, he kissed me again. His mouth started to travel down my neck as I watch my ex's car waiting for me across the street. He pulled down the sleeve of my black dress revealing my breasts. He nibbled and sucked each tits while I grope this crotch. His eyes gleamed when he pulled my panties down only to discover that I'm already wet. He spread my legs wide open and bowed his head to lick my wet fat pussy. The feel of his tongue made me feral. I moaned.

""I'm intimidately turned on by you right now."" He said while fully reclining his seat while unbuckling his belt. I bit my lip in delight. I held his hard throbbing dick in my hand like a prize I won for being a vengeful bitch.

My tongue danced around the fullness of his shaft. I pushed my head further down to let his dick soak deep in my throat. I sloppily sucked and licked his dick like a cum hungry slut. 

The wet sound of his dick in my mouth and his fingers in my pussy was music to ears. I couldn't take it any longer, I crouched and sat on top of him. I don't know how we managed to fit ourselves on the driver's seat but the interior of his car is spacious enough to do some car fun.

His mouth on my tits. I moved my hips grinding carefully so as not to attract a scene. I gasped for air feeling his thickness deep inside me. I shivered when he pulled my hair back. 

My hands on his chest, his hands on my ass. We're moving in a rhythmic slow motion. My juices dripping down. We were breathing heavily, kissing torridly, while looking at each other's eyes. It was an intimate powerful union of two bodies intertwined. 

""I want to swallow every drop of you."" I whispered to his ear.

He thrusted his hip up faster while pulling my hair back. I fucking came. I transferred back to my seat and sucked him again. I felt the stream of his cum in mouth. I swallowed.

We essentially fucked inside the car while my ex was waiting for me across the street. He could've seen us. So what if he did? Revenge sex never felt this good.

**FLOOZY**

As I'm about to alight, Rye reached for my hand, kissed me on the lips and said, ""I'll be waiting when you're done mindfucking him.""

I walked towards Lex's car. He greeted me with the sweetest courtesy, ""Bakit ang tagal mo? San ka galing?!""

I just had sex with a man he was jealous of. My mind is awake. My nerves calm. His toxicity won't budge me. I can't be argumentative if I want to bring him down. My approach should be calm and collected. 

I slightly tilted my head, flashed on a smile and I said, ""Bakit ang gwapo mo pag nagagalit?""

He was taken aback, he expected me to argue with him but I didn't. And just like that, kinilig ang gago!

He updated me about his life since we broke up while we were on our way to a nearby motel. Depressed daw sya dahil lulong na sya sa sugal at baon na sa utang. He said he couldn't pay me back because loansharks are chasing after him. Online lenders are harassing him for not paying on time. His contacts, family, and friends are mad at him because they were being harrassed too. What a shameful way to be known for a guy who loves to bask in the spotlight. Kakahiya.

""I don't have money, Lex. Sex lang 'to.""

I took a shower to cleanse the car endeavor I had with Rye 30 minutes ago. Lex was surprised to see me get a condom from my purse, ""Bakit may condom?""

""You cheated on me and slept with someone else. You want to talk about it?"" *I can gaslight him too.*

He didn't say a word but his eyes were yearning. I was standing against the table, he kissed me and I apathetically kissed him back. He took the towel wrapped off me, I'm still damped from the shower. He raised my right leg and propped me on the table. He spread my legs wide and ate me. Rye's spit and juices might still be inside me from 30 mins ago and I'm letting Lex have a taste of it. 

He moved me to the bed and fucked me missionary with his eyes fixed on me. I just let him have his way, kissing and licking all over my body as I stare blankly to our reflection in the cieling. I rolled him down and I'm now on top. My hands wrapped around his neck while I cowgirl him. Oh to squeeze it harder only made me want to choke him to death!

He flipped me and I'm on all fours. He fucked me deep and hard from behind. He slapped my ass while kissing my back. He arched me down and fucked me prone bone. I came. He flipped me again, I sucked his dick and he shot his load on my face. 

Yes, I fucked 2 guys, one after another, in 3 hours. What a floozy thing to do! But honestly, it only empowered me. 

**PSYCHO**

Never underestimate the power of pillowtalk. It's a sensual act where 2 people connect on a higher vibration right after fucking. It's during these fleeting moments when the mind is clear and the subconscious is vulnerable to infiltrate. A mindfuck, if you will.

Lex worked as a procurement manager in healthcare. He has access to all kinds of company assets (i.e., medical equipment, laptops, phones, cars, etc.) The collapse of his finances due to his gambling addiction and the loan sharks chasing after him - I knew that he will never get out of this mess. I used that knowledge as my leverage for revenge.

I insinuated the idea of him ""borrowing"" company assets and pawning them so he can pay for his massive debt temporarily. I only insinuated verbally - after fucking, during pillowtalk, and never through chat or calls so there can be no traces.

We started to fuck frequently. I made sure to spice it up with a tease to avoid suspicion. I didn't bother me knowing that there's another woman he fucks with. Our sex was passionate but not as spectacular like it used to. I fucked him because it was necessary. This went on for a month until he was able to sneak one asset out, then another, and then more. Little did he know that I was setting him up to a vicious cycle with no way out.

He started to become delirious when his massive debt turned catasthropic in 3 months. I insinuated him to sell some medical equipments off the books and he did. Some he even sold in FB Marketplace. Until he pawned one of the company car that was supposed to be for a medical representative. Did he pay his debt after pawning? No. He gambled all the money instead and lost everything. *Perfect* 

Meanwhile, I sent an anonymous email to his boss pretending to be one their employees, complaining the lack or missing assets. This triggered for an audit check which eventually led to an investigation. Two weeks later, the company determined via cctv the missing assets and the missing company car which he pawned. They eventually filed a lawsuit against him.

And the setbacks unfolding:

He was terminated at work. His car repossessed. He was so stressed out that he admitted all his wrongdoings in court. He now has a record of theft in NBI and he will carry it to every company he applies to and he won't be regularized. He can clear it, but it won't be fast easy.

All this time he had no idea that I manipulated him to steal. He didn't realize that it was me fucking him from behind all along. I took advantage of his weakness and vulnerability, the exact same way as he did to me.

I watched him bawling in tears of his massive debt.
I watched his career crumbled into pieces.
I watched his mental health decline. 
I watched him grieve for the loss of his car.
I watched him fall into the abyss of whirlwind emotions. 

I immediately cut all my ties with him.

He still has not apologized to me or paid me back my 360k. I've decided to let that go in exchange for my peace of mind. 

I've witnessed his downfall - it was glorious and good enough for me.

**Did I enjoy fucking him? Yes.**

**Did I feel any remorse? No.**

**Am I a psycho? Absolutely.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/1axsj9y/fiery_passionate_revenge/,t2_fh2lo08r3,1708665531.0
What I Learned From Miss Margaret's Secret Class: Introduction,"Context: I've been getting a few messages about people who've stumbled on my stories (congratulations for scrolling down that far, by the by) and want more. Well, okay.

Me: 23, doing better, but apparently still had enough room to get to my best - with a little help.

Why I'm telling this: Feeling nostalgic. Also, I haven't written in a while - I had to take some time off to make sure writing about this stuff wouldn't kick my already frustrated libido up to 11. Thankfully, I've calmed down somewhat.

\---

I've always believed that your skill in sex is determined by two things: how often you do it, and who exactly you do it with.

Now this might seem obvious, but in the era where hentai, porn, and Twitch exists, I think it bears repeating. Things will not always go the way that you see online, since the whole point of these things is that they're PERFORMANCES.

(Yes, even the amateurs. Don't kid yourselves.)

Learning about how skilled you are at sex - or even what type of sex you like - takes time, experience, and most importantly the right partner/s. Keep fucking virgins and no matter how many of them you do, you'll break once the first experienced girl comes your way.

So having gotten a few questions and more than my fair share of ""you really give off that dominant vibe"" thrown my way, I've decided to revisit my time with someone who was extremely important in teaching me how to give orders.

\---

""Did you get all that, Silver?""

I nodded. I would've usually spoken in any other situation, but the sheer ""magnitude"" of what I was facing made me really not trust whatever would escape my lips.

""Good. I know that this is only your third month with us, but I'm very grateful for all your help.""

Another nod. I was very determined to only stare into her eyes and nothing else. Unfortunately, she stood up from her desk, and that's when it got a lot harder.

Margaret Robinson (though she insisted on being called Miss Mary) was one of the high-ranking management of the company I was presently attached to as a consultant. She had been flown in from the UK to oversee the development/training of a new department, and already had a sterling reputation for being straight-to-the-point, efficient, and results-oriented.

She was also a dead ringer for a boss that you'd like to fuck. She NEVER dressed skimpily, but her choice of turtleneck sweaters, pencil skirts, and dark stockings with high heels just... worked. It certainly worked on some of the people she was supposed to be training, and it was certainly bloody working on me.

The large breasts, the thin waist, and those hips were only the start - with her piercing blue eyes and posh, RP accent, she was the beginning of every office worker's wet dream. Naturally, that made her untouchable, even though I knew plenty of us would like to... file her paperwork.

As for yours truly? Given my previous experience with mostly European clients and my overall familiarity with process engineering solutions, I was assigned as one of the ""consultants"" in her project.

I stood up, using my coat to hide the somewhat traitorous bulge I was currently sporting. ""Of course, miss Mary. I'll be happy to provide any more assistance that you may require.""

""Mmmm. That's all.""

But as I turned to leave, the neckline of my coat caught on the back of the chair, and I ended up knocking it and my bag to the ground. My notes flew everywhere.

""Damn! Sorry, Miss Mary, I'll get this.""

She let out a tiny laugh. ""It's fine, I'll help.""

She knelt down and started picking up papers. We gathered the notes in silence for a while, though my eye occasionally brushed across the smooth, velvet texture of her chocolate-brown stockings for the day. I stood up and stacked the papers on her desk.

""Silver? A hand?""

""Oh, right. Yes."" Without thinking, I swung around to face her.... and that attention-seeking little shit in my pants chose that EXACT same moment to crow and present itself.

Mary, not noticing until she had already taken my hand, received a full view of my very uncovered and very bulging pants. I, like the absolute moron that I was, didn't notice until she had already been staring at it for five seconds.

""Um,"" I said. She hadn't said anything, but her eyes slowly travelled up from my crotch area all the way to my eyes. She hadn't moved, and I briefly wondered if I had been fired. Did this count as sexual harassment?

Our eyes met for what felt like minutes. Me, worrying if I was about to be sent to HR, and her, burrowing those blue eyes into my brain. Finally, she spoke.

""You might want to pull me up, Silver.""

Right. I pulled her to her feet, which was not easy considering that Mary was 5'9 without her heels on. But even as she rose to her full height, she never broke eye contact - and I didn't either, but out of fear or shame, I didn't know.

We spent another few seconds staring into each other's eyes before she broke out in a smile. ""You may go, Silver.""

I nodded. I quickly stuffed my things into my bag, took the offending coat that had somehow made it into her hands, and half-genuflected out of the room.

\---

I spent the entire week after that trying to suss out whether or not I committed a lawsuit-worthy incident in her office, but Mary didn't say anything about what transpired, and I didn't really know how to bring it up.

Besides, she was right back at her desk the next day like nothing had happened. I didn't really detect any changes at all in her behaviour, though I did notice she was wearing slightly redder lipstick than usual.

After a few more measured encounters and ensuring that I had the loosest pair of corporate slacks whenever I was called into her office, I chalked it up as a workplace faux pas that she probably let slide. Having brought the matter to a conclusion in my head, I sank my head back into my work.

That's when Mary decided to teach me my first lesson: if you keep a woman waiting for too long, she'll eventually take what she wants, no matter what she'll need to do to get it.

\---

As she was from the UK, Mary's hours often stretched far longer than ours in Makati. It wasn't uncommon to have her send us home for the day while still in her office - and while most of the men directly under her command would volunteer to stay behind, she'd always frown and insist that they go home.

I on the other hand did not join these gestures, because my commute home was an hour and a half on a good day, and I didn't really feel like staying longer at the office even if they paid me more.  
However, as our project was getting to a critical point, I suddenly found myself summoned to her office on a Thursday night.

""Silver, I'm going to need you to stay behind tomorrow, after hours.""

""Problem, Miss Mary?""

She sighed, brushing her long dark hair away from her face. ""We have a bottleneck in our supply chain - it turns out that we're about a metric ton short of the raw material that we'll need to supply our clients.""

I frowned. Bottlenecks like these were not uncommon in our line of work, but I had no idea how I was supposed to help. This issue sounded more like a problem for our logistics department - a thought I shared out loud.

Mary sighed again and swivelled her chair away from me. ""Unfortunately I'm going to need you to liaison between the UK team and the Philippine team with the overall process of getting them here.""

""So you're making me the middleman? This seems a bit out of my paygrade, miss Mary.""

She turned her chair back ever so slightly, and once again those piercing blue eyes met mine. ""I need you, Silver."" Her tone invited no discussion.

Now, if I was slightly more self-aware and was not wondering how to do a job I had absolutely no training for, I would've noticed the slight purr in her voice around the last syllables of that sentence. But as the tone of her voice didn't invite any discussion, I simply nodded.

""Good. I'll make sure you're properly compensated, of course.""

\---

The next workday passed by without incident, though I did notice that Mary had swapped out her usual red lipstick for a subtle shade of purple. It was striking against her black turtleneck for the day, but aside from that, I thought all was well.

That night, when all of the staff was sent home and it was just us in her office, I heard a quiet *click*.

I frowned for a bit, but shook my head and turned back to the paperwork I was checking.

A few more moments and I heard another strange set of noises.

*Whirr. Click. Whirr. Click.*

Not wanting to be told off for reacting to noises when I was supposed to be doing my job, I kept my head down and continued to work.

*Rustle. Rustle. Whirr. Click.*

“Silver?”

“Yes, Miss Mary?”

“How are those papers going along?”

“I’m just about through with the first couple of pages, Miss Mary. Based on the briefing earlier today, I think we can close some gaps in the supply chain by shuffling around the shipping dates. The thing is, I’m not so familiar with the costs of transportation, so….”

“Indeed? Let me see.”

I obligingly turned around only to find Mary’s face inches from mine, and those blue eyes locking me in place. She was so close, I could actually smell the coffee that she was drinking earlier in the afternoon on her breath.

“Um,” I started, not really knowing how to react. I leaned as far back into my chair as possible, trying to put some distance between myself and those eyes. “As I was saying, transportation costs aren’t really something I know much about so this might be an issue with…”

The rest of my sentence petered away as she leaned her head slightly to one side. It was at this moment that I noticed she had put both of her hands on the armrests of my office chair. She said nothing, so I gulped in some air and tried to continue.

“... with our logistics department, since Robert already said the other day that moving things by truck in the UK hasn’t been the easiest thing lately.” The last parts of that sentence were almost a whisper, and still, Mary said nothing.

Desperate to find something to break the silence with, I frantically looked around the room, and noticed three things.

One, the blinds around Mary’s office had been shuttered closed, which explained all the whirring and clicking sounds I heard earlier. Two, her door also appeared to be locked. Finally, I looked at the clock and saw it was 9:00 pm – and I knew from our stories together at lunch that Kuya Jobert, our nightguard on the office floor, was going out for a smoke.

“Miss Mary… are you trying to seduce me?”

As soon as the words left my mouth, I immediately wished I could take them back – because if the incident with my pants wasn’t going to get me fired, THAT remark definitely will. But having received my [fair share of aggressive treatments from women](https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/qgr9wr/that_time_in_boracay_part_1_aya/), I did not want to take this lying down. Or sitting down, in my case.

Mary smiled. “Was I being too obvious?”

Before I could answer, those purple-brushed lips claimed mine.

\---

If I had to describe the kiss, I’d have to say it was sensual. It wasn’t like the devouring kisses of someone hungry, or the straightforward kisses of someone who wanted something more, but a gentle, beckoning sort of kiss. She lingered on the bottom of my lips, running her tongue across the surface and pulling it back gently.

Overall, the kiss lasted maybe fifteen seconds. But when she pulled away, I was breathing as I had run for fifteen flights of stairs.

“Miss…”

“Mary.”

“Mary.”

“Go on,” she smiled. She was still leaning with her hands on my armrests. “Do tell me how this is inappropriate, and that 'you’re the boss and I’m the employee' and more about how you could possibly get fired for what I just did.”

I closed my legs in response, which caused her to look down in brief surprise and amusement. Her smile got wider, and she put one knee on the side of my chair. Her pencil skirt (charcoal gray that day) pushed even higher up her hips.

“Okay, as long as we’re being frank with each other, I have had very not-safe-for-work ideas about this sort of situation happening,” I started, trying to ignore the soft sounds of cotton on silk as she moved her knee closer to my waist, “but I never thought this would happen.”

Mary chuckled, a deep, throaty laugh that whispered in my ears. “And were these ideas before or after I noticed your little friend here?”

Well, no use hiding the erection now, I thought. “Well… you’re not exactly hiding your assets, Mary.”

“Mmmm, I love the way you dance around the topic. I’m going to have a lot of fun with you, Silver.”

I felt simultaneously worried and excited upon hearing those words. “A lot of fun?”

Mary put her other knee on my chair and straddled me. As I felt the suspension sink us an inch or so under our weight, something in my pants flared up in response. At this point, her pencil skirt was more or less hugging her waist. “Oh, yes, a lot of fun. But you’ll also be punished, at least a little bit.”

“What? Why?”

Mary chuckled again and put her hands on my face. I could smell the perfume on her wrists, but it was her eyes and her lips that held me down. “You don’t keep a lady like me waiting, Silver.”

And she kissed me again.

\---

And there we go! Sorry for the long preamble, but this entire story (arc?) took place over around half a year, so there's quite a few things to cover. I'll try to update as much as I can, but I do want to do Mary's lessons some justice - and there's quite a few things she taught me that I can't exactly share.

I also have other ideas for some of my other experiences, but there won't be a few new ones for a while. I haven't really been out and about this year, and I'm off the dating apps... so all my future stories will probably be just stuff I've been through before.

Maybe I should get into fiction writing, it'll be a lot easier... but for now, I'll settle for the nostalgia.

\-------

*""Bakit mag-isa ka lang?""* I asked as I got past the gate. I was deflecting, of course. Deep inside, I was panicking. Did Kaye just invite me inside her house while she's alone? What does this all mean? What the fuck is happening??? Ang daming thoughts sa isip ko, di pa nakakatulong na medyo hilo pa rin ako from the alcohol.

*""Si mama nasa kanila Tita Irma sa Cavite. Si ate naman nasa boyfriend nya. Bukas pa balik nila. Si Ate Malou bukas pa ng tanghali darating.""* she spoke, dire-diretso. Nakayuko pa rin sya. Pakiramadam ko pareho kaming walang clue sa mga nangyayari at mangyayari.

*""A okay...""* lang ang nareply ko. May halong tuwa at kaba na kami lang mag-isa sa bahay nila. So many thoughts racing around my head, like, gusto ko na syang halikan, pero go signal na ba na pwede ko syang halikan dahil pinapasok na nya ko sa bahay nila? Baka wala lang to, baka pag hinalikan ko sya sampalin nya rin ako katulad ng ginawa nya ke Dick.

I walked behind her as she crossed the lawn to their door. It was big sturdy wooden door. Unang pumasok sa isip ko yung Door of Truth sa Fullmetal Alchemist when I saw it, pero baka dahil madilim lang nung time na yun. Nakatayo lang ako sa likuran nya, waiting for her to open it, pero once again, nagtagal sya sa kakahanap sa tamang susi.

*""Okay ka lang ba?""* I asked. Obviously, excited ako sa mga nangyayari at ineexpect ko na mangyayari, pero kung hindi sya okay, mas mabuti na lang na umuwi na lang ako.

*""Sorry sa tagal. Giniginaw kasi ako.""*

*Sinungaling. Suot mo pa rin kaya hoodie ko*, I thought.

At last she swung it open. She stepped inside and held it open for me to enter. All the light inside her house was coming from the lamp post outside. I motioned to take off my shoes, but she told me it was okay to bring it in.

This is it, I thought. Or is it? Everything may change after this, or maybe not? Is this me crossing the Rubicon? I stepped in, and looked around. May sofa sa kanan ko, flanked by two side tables, may TV sa bandang unahan. I can hear her closing the door behind me. *Upo ka muna*, she was mumbling. *Kuha kitang tubig.* She dropped her purse and beret sa sofa, then started to walk away from me, probably towards the kitchen.

You know how people say may moments sa buhay nila na parang everything was in slow motion while they're being forced to make a decision quickly? This was one of those moments for me. I can see her slowly walking away, illuminated by the orange glow from the lamp post outside. For some reason, parang ang sakit sa puso nung image na yun.

So I made my decision. I grabbed her by the arm and waist, pulled her towards me, and kissed her.

At first she was trying to push me away, but I held her tight and kept on kissing her. She wasn't kissing me back, pero she wasn't stopping her lips from opening din naman. I felt na unti-unting humihina yung pagpiglas nya, so I loosened my grip. I placed one hand on the small of her back, she responded by arching her back slightly. With my free hand, I placed it on her neck, my thumb on her chin, forcing her to open her mouth more. I wanted to stick my tongue down her throat. I gave her a small flick with my tongue, but she once again tried to push me away. I didn't fight back, this time she succeeded on prying my lips from hers.

I still had her in my arms, one hand on her neck, the other on her back, but she was staring at me with this expression na hindi ko ma-define kung anger ba or ano, her arms between us trying to keep me away. Every time I tried to lean forward to kiss her again on the lips, tinutulak nya ko at nilalayo nya yung mukha nya. Kada ginagawa nya yun, tinititigan ko sya and tinatantya ko yung expression nya. Parang halong *sige, subukan mo* at *wtf are you doing?*

*""Ayaw mong halikan kita?""* I asked. No response. I leaned forward, iniwas nya ulit mga labi nya by turning her head.

*""Sige, edi dito muna.""* I said as I kissed her chin. Tinry nyang iiwas pero I found my target. Kissed her sa jaw, up to her cheek, straight to her earlobes. Then I pulled away and stared at her. Her eyes looked like she was angry, but she was biting her lower lip.

I tried again for the lips, pero iniwas nya ulit. *""Fine. Then here?""* I said as I kissed her neck. Then to her shoulders. Then to her collarbones.

I heard a soft whimper from her.

I stopped what I was doing and looked at her. She had this expression of embarrassment, like nahiya sya with what just came out of her mouth. Wala akong planong palampasin tong nangyari na to, though. It felt like ammo from the gods, and I'm definitely not throwing away my shot!

*""So gusto mo palang hinahalikan dito a.""* I said as I dove back in to kiss her collarbones. Ramdam ko na nagpipigil sya ng halinghing, so dahan-dahan kong binababa paghalik ko sa kanya over her dress. Destination: boobs. I took a quick glance at her face: she had her eyes closed and was biting her lip again, trying to suppress her moans.

I remember, kahit ang dami nyang ininom, sobrang bango pa rin nya. Hindi natabunan ng amoy ng alak at yosi yung amoy nya. Habang bumababa papunta sa dibdib nya yung mga halik ko, nararamdaman ko yung isa nyang kamay trying to push my head away. At the same time, yung isang kamay naman nya, nakahawak sa batok ko, hinihila naman ako palapit sa kanya. Ah, the duality of this woman. Sobrang gulo, pero sobrang turned on ko sa back-and-forth nya between letting me do my thing or stopping me.

I was in this intoxicated state when I blurted out the worst thing I could've ever said as my hands started exploring her body: I asked her where Dick felt her up so I can do the same.

My right cheek stung after she slapped me.

I don't know what I was thinking, why I thought what I said was effective dirty talk, pero back then, I thought I only had two options. A. Ruin the sexual tension and apologize for what I just said, hope she forgives me and lets me proceed with what we've been doing, or B. Keep up this bad boy dom act, maintain the sexual tension, and hope she submits to what I want. So dahil nakainom at may pa-macho effect ako, I chose the latter.

*""Gusto mo bang mga kamay ni Dick ang huling humawak dyan? Kala ko ba sabi mo do something to make you forget what that asshole did?!""* sabi ko. She slapped me again.

*""I'll be gentler with my hands. Or baka gusto mo rougher?""* sabi ko, nanlalaki mata, trying to look threatening. She just stared back at me, probably contemplating whether to slap me again or not.

*""Fuck you, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_.""* sabi nya. *""I thought you liked me...""* her voice was almost as soft as a whisper when she said this. Nahimasmasan utak ko. Puta, did I just make a huge mistake?

*""I do like you...""* I replied. Binitawan ko sya and sat at the sofa, still staring at her. Naiwan syang nakatayo, the orange light on her face. She had this look of indignation, na hindi ko alam kung dahil ba sa mga sinimulan ko, o dahil sa bigla ko syang iniwanan.

I tapped the part of the sofa to my left as I stared at her. She shook her head. I let out a big sigh and bowed my head. Maybe I did misread this. Fuckfuckfuck.

*""You like me?""* bigla nyang tinanong, still standing.

I raised my head and looked at her. *""Yes.""*

*""Are you sure it's not the alcohol talking?""* sabi nya.

*""I'm sure.""* I said. Parang ayaw nyang maniwala so I enumerated the things I liked about her: her wit, her mental toughness, her empathy, the way her eyes smile when she smiles, how she would always be ready to give a shoulder to cry on to Patty when she had a problems her slender legs, the way her curves go from her waist to her ass...

*""Manyak!""* sabi nya when I mentioned her curves. I managed a chuckle.

*""So pano yun, porke't ba you like me, ganon na lang yun, pwede mo na ko agad halikan?""* she said a few seconds later.

Boom. Checkmate. Game over. Bye bye. Misread this, I definitely did! There was a hint of castigation sa boses nya. I looked at her, trying to think of what to say. Pero in the end, hindi rin ako nakasagot. Yumuko na lang ulit ako, nahiya na kong tumingin sa mga mata nya. I covered my face with my hands. *""Sorry.""* I said. Wala naman nang ibang dapat sabihin e. I definitely fucked up.

It was quiet for a while, then I heard her take steps towards me. Suddenly her hands were on mine. I looked up and she was standing in front of me. The light from outside didn't reach her face, pero I swear, I can see that familiar smile on her face.

*""I've always thought you liked Patty.""* Kaye said. *""Tuwing magkakasama kasi tayong apat nila Jan, parang super sweet mo sa kanya. Lagi mo pa nga syang nililibre ng ice cream pag nagkakasabay tayo ng lunch. Akala ko talaga sya gusto mo.""*

Kaye, kung alam mo lang kung ano ang namagitan sa amin ni Patty. Pero I couldn't tell her that. Definitely not during that moment.

*""Kumportable kasi ako kay Patty. Shempre awkward ako sa 'yo kasi may gusto nga ako sa 'yo.""* dahilan ko. *""Halos lumipad nga ako kanina papunta sa harap ng PC nung sinabi mong tatawag ka sa Skype e.""*

*""Manyak mo talaga e no?""* sagot nya, playfully slapping me in the face. *""Kung anu-ano siguro iniisip mo no? Kaya bigla-bigla kang nanghahalik e.""* She was back to her old self. I'm glad. Binitawan nya kamay ko. *""Kuha lang ako ng tubig na maiinom natin.""* sabi nya, then she walked away.

A wave of relief washed over me. At least hindi na sya galit. But then, naalala ko, wala pa rin pala syang sagot regarding sa confession ko. I wasn't rejected outright, pero wala rin namang pag-reciprocate ng feelings na naganap. Nasa Limbo pa rin ako, pero happy na ko na hindi ako natulad kay Dick, kahit na namisread ko tong mga pangyayari.

Pagbalik nya sa sala, she had two glasses of water in her hands. Inabot nya sa kin yung isa at naubos ko yung tubig sa isang tungga. I handed her back the glass as she took a drink from her own. She was standing in front of me while I was still seated sa sofa.

*""Good ka na?""* sabi nya pagkatapos nyang ipatong yung mga baso sa side table. She started taking off my hoodie.

*""Oo.""* sabi ko. Okay na ko kung in Limbo pa rin ako, at least uuwi ako nang hindi galit sakin si Kaye. Naisip ko, tatawagan ko na lang sya pag-uwi ko sa bahay. Give her time to process things. Or kung hindi, kahit pag nagkita na lang ulit kami sa office. We have time, sabi ko sa sarili. Learn your lesson, wag madaliin.

Tumayo na ko and I extended my hand to take my hoodie from her. Pero instead of giving me the hoodie, she tossed it at my side, sa sofa.

Then she pushed me back to the sofa and straddled me, her hands on my face. She leaned forward and kissed me on the lips.

I was surprised by what happened, pero I kissed back. My hands found familiar places sa katawan nya: sa batok nya, sa small of her back. I can feel her grinding on me as our tongues twisted inside of our mouths. I placed both my hands sa waist nya, my pinky fingers carefully trying to lift her dress inch by inch.

*""Kinabahan ka ba, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_?""* sabi nya in between kisses. *""Akala mo galit din ako sa 'yo, no?""*

Tango na lang ang naisagot ko sa mga tanong nya.

*""Dapat bubulungan ko na yung taxi driver kanina na iliko tayo sa Canley e...""* sabi nya habang hinahalikan ko leeg nya. Yung mga kamay ko gumagala na sa katawan nya. My right hand was caressing her left thigh. Ang kinis sobra, at ang lambot. I went back to kissing her lips. She bit my lower lip and hinatak nya with her teeth. Sobrang wild. It was like she wanted to tear my lips off me. That was the first time someone did that to me that roughly.

Umahon muna ko saglit kasi medyo masakit na rin yung mga kagat nya, at dahil naalala ko na nakainom nga pala sya. *""Wait wait... baka naman dahil lang 'to sa alcohol a!""* sabi ko.

Her faced changed from that of pleasure, to that of *Are you fucking serious right now?*

*""No, pero it helps.""* sabi nya as she planted small kisses on my face. *""Yes, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_, I've had a crush on you since August, when you stayed behind and waited for me nung pinatapos sa akin ni TL yung workload nung araw na yun.""* she said in between kisses. *""Alam ni Patty.""* she kissed my nose. *""Alam ni Jan.""* she kissed my cheeks. *""Nalaman na rin ni Dick kanina when he tried to get on with me.""* she was giving my lips small, soft kisses. *""Sabi nya tropa lang daw tingin mo sakin, so I slapped him. Speaking of Dick....""*

She grabbed my free hand and placed it on her chest, on her right boob. I cupped it lightly, and gave it a squeeze, She wasn't wearing a bra underneath. She threw her head back and I saw her lick her lips.

*""This was where Dick felt me up.""* sabi nya.

Tangina she got me wrapped around her fingers! The moment I heard those words, para akong asong pinakawalan. Naalala ko yung mga sinabi nya earlier sa taxi: *Do something to make me forget what that asshole did!* I started ravaging her with my lips and tongue, from her mouth to her shoulders. Yung kanang kamay ko napunta na sa left cheek ng butt nya, and I guess my question that morning was answered: she wasn't wearing shorts underneath that very short dress.

*""You are naughty.""* sabi ko. *""Umattend ka ba ng binyag ng inaanak natin nang walang bra?""*

*""Hindi, no.""* she answered with a smile. *""Tinanggal ko lang kanina habang nasa kitchen. Di naman na kailangan ngayon e.""*

Her answer turned me on. So pinagplanuhan nya talaga to a, naisip ko. *""Hindi ko alam na ganito ka ka-naughty.""* sabi ko.

*""Why do you think Patty and I are so close?""* she said while I continued kissing her sa kahit anong parte ng katawan nya na maabot ko. *""Pareho kaming naughty. Alam mo ba, until recently, may fubu yun!""*

Napatigil ako sa paghalik ko sa kanya. *""W-weh?!""* sabi ko, kunwari gulat. My hands were on her boobs now, and I was looking for her nipples over dress. Umaasa ako na ma-divert yung topic pag napisil ko nipples nya.

*""Oo!""* sabi nya, in between moans. I found one of her nipples, and was pinching them with my fingers while I was kissing her neck. I was hoping to get her aroused enough to stop talking.

*""Nakita ko one time may chikinini sya sa may balikat! Kaso ayaw nyang sabihin kung sino. Ni picture nga ayaw magpakita. Whoever was the guy, mukha namang natuwa si Patty sa kanya.""* she said.

Pride swelled up within me. At this point, her dress was hiked up so high you'd think she was only wearing a top and her cotton panties. I let my hands settle muna sa waist nya, my thumbs moving in circles against her stomach. Then I let my open mouth dive onto her chest, scanning for her nipples underneath her babydoll dress. Once I found them, I flicked my tongue back and forth, making that part of her dress wet. She let out a soft moan.

She started kissing the my ears while I continued to suck one of her nipples. *""Unzip me.""* she whispered to me. *""Ang tigas mo na kagad.""* dagdag pa nya. I felt her hands fumble down there, so I stopped what I was doing muna at sumandal ako. She unbuckled my belt, and then took it off. She fumbled with the button of my pants, and while she did that, I leaned forward again and one of my hands reached for the back of her dress. I felt my pants loosen, she successfully undid the button and was going for the zipper. At the same time, I found what I was looking for and started to unzip her dress.

She stopped what she was doing for a second and proceeded to take off her dress over her head. I took a while to admire her breasts bathed by orange light. Naramdaman kong nakatitig sya sa akin habang nakatutok pa rin ang tingin ko sa dibdib nya. Her nipples were already very hard. I couldn't resist it anymore, I cupped one of her boobs and flicked her nipple as hard as I can. She let out a soft *""Aahhh...""* so I followed it up by putting it all in my mouth.

*""Fuck...""* she said with bated breaths. *""Ang init ng dila mo.""* My hands went back to exploring her body, right hand playing with one of her nipples, left hand on her ass, trying to slide down her panties. I alternated between her two nipples. Kada inaalis ko yung bibig ko isang nipple nya, she lets out this audible gasp, na para bang sinasabihan nya ko ng ""*Bakit mo inalis?!""*, pero napapalitan din ng ungol pag sinubo ko na yung isa pa.

She started unbuttoning my shirt habang nag-eenjoy pa ko sa boobs nya. When she undid the last button, I stopped to take off the shirt first, pero habang ginagawa ko yun, umalis sya sa pag-straddle sa akin. At first I was disappointed, but then she knelt in front of me and started on pulling down my pants na para bang nagmamadali. Puta, never in a million years kong naisip na ganito si Kaye when it comes to sex. Aggressive. I knew she was no longer a virgin, pero starting with the lip-biting and now hastily taking off my pants, medyo nabigla ako. Tas naalala ko yung sinabi nya kanina: *Why do you think Patty and I are close? Pareho kaming naughty.*

Nung natanggal na nya pants ko, she shifted her focus to my crotch. She started rubbing my cock through my boxer briefs, all while looking at me with this sly smile. *""I haven't given a BJ, or even a handjob, in a while, wag ka sana mag-expect.""* sabi nya. *""Feeling ko rusty na ko.""*

*""Ok lang, I hear it's like riding a bicycle. Basta tandaan mo walang ngipin a!""* biro ko sa kanya.

*""Sira.""* sabi nya. *""Alam mo yung mga jokes mo panira ng mood.""* dagdag nya, nagkukunwaring inis.

*""Okay, I'll shut up na.""* I replied, my arms half up in the air, chuckling. She hit me in the leg and I mouthed *""Okay, okay, I'll really stop na.""*

I remember feeling very happy at that moment, and it wasn't because my office crush was about to give me a blowjob. It wasn't because I got to play with her nipples earlier either. I know I started obsessing over Kaye because of her curves, pero during the past few months that I worked with her, I really started to admire everything about her. Sa office, sobrang reliable nya. May initiative and willingness to learn. She has her values and beliefs, and will fight you to the death over them, pero she's not afraid to admit if she was in the wrong. She was, for me back then, perfect, both inside and outside.

She took off my underwear. Hindi ako kalakihan, pero I remember hearing her say *""Oh my...""* when she first laid eyes on my cock. *""Tigilan mo nga ako""* I said, pero she just looked at me with her mouth open. Then she reached for my cock, and I remember a jolt of electricity running through me when her hand took grab of it. Her hands were generating heat. She started stroking it up and down, and positioned her mouth over the mouth. She started with just a quick flick of her tongue sa dulo ng tite ko, pero the sensation was enough to send shivers down my spine.

Before I knew what was happening, she had the whole head inside her mouth, her tongue constantly flicking in all directions inside. Napaungol ako with what she was doing, and then she proceeded to make this smacking sound with her mouth. Then she started to give me the sloppiest, noisiest blowjob ever. Tangina, pakiramdam ko ang sarap sarap ko with how she was devouring my cock. A few seconds later, she was trying to take it all in, shaft and all. I can hear her gagging, pero she was still trying hard to get everything inside her mouth. Puro *""fuck fuck fuck""* na lang ang nasasabi ko non. Then it happened: her lips reached the base of my cock, and then I felt her tongue flick where the shaft met my balls. After that she eased up and removed her mouth from my cock, pero she kept stroking it with her hand. She looked at me, and there were tears in her eyes and some drool on her chin, all from the gagging.

*""Rusty pala a.""* I said. *""Come here.""* I pulled her up towards me and started kissing her mouth. *""I can't believe...""* I bit her lower lip. *""...you just...""* our tongues started wrestling with one another. *""...deep throated me...""* I said as my thumbs started playing with the waistband of her panties.

*""I was trying to impress you.""* she said. *""I'm not yet done, babe.""* She went back down on me, and I remember trying to protest because I wanted to eat her pussy naman, pero she waved me off and told me to lie back and enjoy the show.

She went back to sucking my cock, and the warmth and wetness of her mouth brought me bliss. If I'm gonna be honest, that first blowjob she gave me wasn't the best technique-wise, pero it was the best I've ever had because Kaye was the one giving it. My male officemates would be so jealous if they found out what was happening now. They'd probably give everything to be in my position right now, having my cock licked up and down and my balls played with by the office crush.

*""Hey, Kaye...""* I said, almost in a whisper. Her eyes darted to mine with a questioning look, but she didn't stop sucking my cock.

*""Be my girlfriend.""* sabi ko.

I saw her eyes widen, then her brows furrow. When it looked like she finally processed what I said, she took off her mouth from my cock.

*""Walanghiya, wala ka talaga sa timing e no?""* sabi nya, sounding incredulous. Then she want back to giving me a blowjob.

*""So is that a yes?""* pahabol ko. Tumaas yung kilay nya pag tingin nya ulit sa akin, dahil siguro nakita nya yung ngisi sa mukha ko. Then she did this very pronounced bob with her head, up and down, while still having my cock in her mouth.

*""Pakyu ka talaga.""* sabi nya as she stopped and stood up. In a few seconds after, her panties were on her ankles. With the small amount of light from outside, I could see that she was clean shaven. I made a movement to kiss her sa crotch nya, but he stopped me with her hand. *""Bawal.""* she said. *""You don't get to eat me tonight.""*

*""Why?!""* I protested. Eating pussy has always been my favorite part of sex, and I felt slighted that this was being denied to me. Sa totoo lang, mas willing pa akong i-forego yung penetrative sex.

*""Parusa ko yan sa 'yo for kissing me without my permission.""* sabi nya with this cheeky look.

*""Sadista ka.""* I replied. *""So tonight bawal, pero any other night, okay lang?""*

*""Pilosopo.""* she replied. She took one of my hands ang guided it to her crotch.

My fingers started moving towards her pussy. *""Kain bawal, pero finger pwede?""* I asked.

She didn't reply anymore. She closed her eyes and licked her lips. I beckoned her to sit beside me, and she did, spreading her legs. Basang-basa na sya, I can see. My hand started from her inner thigh, and then slowly crept to her pussy. She held her breath every time my hand moved closer to her pussy lips. When my fingers reached her pussy, I kissed her mouth to stifle her moans.

I rubbed her clit in circular motions and she wanted to moan loudly, pero every time she did, she found my mouth all over hers. Then I moved my index and middle finger towards her opening, my thumb still on her clit. Sobrang wet na nya, I felt like basta-basta na lang mahihigop papasok yung mga daliri ko sa loob ng puke nya. *""I'm so wet.""* sabi nya. *""Sayang hindi mo matitikman tonight.""*

*""Shut up.""* I said as I inserted my two fingers. It was so warm inside her pussy. I tried to go as deep as I can with my fingers, and then I started slowly finger-fucking her. Kada ipapasok ko yung mga daliri ko, inaangat nya yung pwet nya para salubungin yung motion ng mga daliri ko. Unti-unti ko rin binilisan yung paglabas-masok ng mga daliri ko, at unti-unti ring bumilis ang paggalaw ng balakang nya. I stopped kissing her by then, and was focused on making her cum with my fingers. Di na rin sya nagpigil, she started moaning loudly. One of her hands went to her clit and started rubbing, the other started pinching her nipples. Then after a few more minutes, her hips started convulsing, her eyes started fluttering, and she let out this very prolonged *""aaaaaaahhhh""*. The next thing I know, my hand was covered in her pussy juices.

Her body went limp, and she buried her face in my chest. I was planning to lick all her pussy juices from my hand, but she snatched my hand away and put each of my fingers in her mouth.

*""Not tonight, baby.""* she repeated, as she planted a kiss on my cheek. *""You don't get to taste me tonight.""* She looked and sounded really exhausted.

*""At least finish me off, Kaye.""* sabi ko, medyo may inis na.

*""Give me a sec, it's been a while since I got that kind of release. Sabi sayo rusty na ko e.""* she said as she lay beside me.

*""Okay.""* I replied and kissed her forehead. I felt her hand go for my cock again, stroking it gently up and down, pero after a minute or two she stopped stroking. I looked at her face. Her eyes were closed and her mouth was agape. It seems that she has fallen asleep.

Normally, sa mga ganitong scenario, maiinis ako. Pero I didn't feel that way with Kaye at that moment. Hinaplos ko yung mukha nya. I thought she looked real pretty, and the thought of having her in my arms right then made my heart flutter.

*""Tinulugan mo ko.""* I said, pabulong. Yung tipong barely audible lang. *""Pero okay lang.""* I continued. *""I think i'm in love with you.""* I didn't expect her to reply, or even hear it, as it looked like she was soundly sleeping. It was like me just saying it to the wind. Sumandal na rin ako sa sofa, and then closed my eyes, and in that moment, I felt the effect of the alcohol once again. I was asleep a few seconds later.

\------

I woke up around 3 in the morning, lying on the sofa with a blanket over me, Kaye sitting on the chair across in her panties and my long-sleeved shirt. I loved that look on her. Nung una parang nanibago pa ko sa surroundings ko, and I tried to remember what happened earlier that night. When Kaye approached me to give me a kiss, the memories came flooding in.

*""Wakey wakey, boyfie...""* she said in a singsong voice. *""I didn't wanna wake you, so kinumutan na lang kita. Tara, lipat tayo sa kama para makatulog ka nang maayos.""*

Medyo natagalan bago nag-register sa utak ko yung mga sinabi nya, pero once I understood, I started putting on my boxer briefs. She then handed me the extra shirt from my bag, para raw comfortable ako sa pagtulog. She helped me carry my other stuff, and then led me upstairs to her room.

Sobrang antok ko pa, and sobrang groggy from last night's alcohol, that when she let me in her room, I just fell down on top of her bed. A few seconds later, she had me lay on my side, with my head on one of her pillows, and she started pulling the blanket over me. She went in afterwards, and she laid down on her side, facing me.

*""You haven't finished me off yet.""* sabi ko, groggy at antok pa rin.

*""I know, sorry.""* she said. Through half-open eyes. I can see that she was smiling. *""Pagod lang with everything that happened. I promise, bawi ako tomorrow when you wake up.""* I just nodded in reply. I felt her hand on my cheek, then she planted a kiss on my nose.

Then I fell asleep once again.

\------

Kaye kept her word that morning. I woke up with my cock out and her stroking it. Sabi nya she couldn't help it kasi sobrang tigas daw. Probably dahil sa morning wood. When I came in her mouth, sobrang dami kong naiputok, dahil siguro naipon from that night. Some of my cum were dripping from the side of her mouth, and she had trouble swallowing all of it, pero in the end she managed to do it. Champion.

We had breakfast, and then we went back to her room to finish where we left off from last night. Kaye now let me eat her out, kasi sabi nya sa ""tonight"" lang naman bawal, at morning na raw naman na. She moaned so loudly as I ate her, I was sure some of her neighbors heard. But she didn't really care. When she was about to cum, she grabbed my head by the hair, then she started grinding her pussy on my face. Tinanggap ng mukha ko yung orgasmic release nya, and when she finished, I kissed her in the mouth para malasahan din nya how she tasted like.

And then we fucked. Multiple times. In one of those times, while she was on her back with her feet on my shoulders and I was pumping in and out of her pussy, I asked her once again to be my girlfriend.

*""Tangina...""* she said in between pumps. *""Yung timing...""* pump pump *""...mo...""* pump pump pump *""...talaga...""* pump pump pump pump.

I remember this clearly kasi I laughed out loud at how she was trying to speak while I was fucking her. It eventually became an inside joke between us when we were dating, like every time we were having sex, I would ask her the most mundane or very unrelated questions. There was one time I asked her what she thought of a certain superhero film, while I was fucking her doggy style. She wanted to slap me for my kakulitan, pero I just kept on fucking her harder until we both came.

And yes, we started being a couple that day. How it happened, is that she eventually gave up from my antics and spoke it clearly. Sabi nya pa, *""Di mo ba nakita tumango ako nung una mo kong tinanong kagabi?""*, and I just told her akala ko normal motions lang while you were sucking my cock. Pinalo nya ko sa legs after I said that, and I just laughed.

Patty and Jan were happy for us when they found out, pero may ilang lalaki sa office na hindi. Like I cared, anyway. Dick was actually one of the few who were okay with it, and very supportive. He once confessed to me that he was really afraid Kaye would report him for sexual harassment for what happened that night. I gave the guy the benefit of the doubt, and arranged a chance for him to apologize formally to her. Kaye accepted, pero she kept her guard up around him.

Kaye and I's dynamic in the office didn't change even if we were dating. Maybe that's the best thing I liked about our relationship, aside from the sex. Pag professional, professional. The sex was great of course. Sabi ko nga, Kaye showed a willingness to learn. I experienced a lot of new stuff with her.

I dated Kaye for more than a year. Why we broke up is something I wouldn't want to get into too much, pero let's just say there were certain red flags about her, that I didn't notice before because I was focused too much on her curves. I left the company for greener pastures a few months before the relationship ended, so I guess naka-contribute din yun. I haven't spoken to her since. Last I heard she already has a kid.

So that's it. I hope you enjoyed reading this trip down memory lane. Thanks for reading!",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/gpubuw/the_office_crush_part_ii_crush_harder_electric/,t2_3tm592q7,1590343721.0
Would you let your gf/wife share you with another girl because that’s her kink (cuckquean)? UPDATE at the end of story.,"I'm not good at writing stories or for the matter of fact telling them, but I'll just type it out as it pops into my head.
I (30 filam/Chinese 5’10) married my amazing wife (29 filipina 5’2) who was surprisingly good at bed and willing to go the extra mile ever since we were dating about 8 years ago. We met when I went to the ph for Med school. She was my seatmate in all our classes. She came from an all girls school and I was her first boyfriend. So I wasn't expecting her to be so enthusiast on learning and improving each time with deep throat, wanting to give me hand jobs in the back seat of friend’s cars to the point of cumming and if I refused to cum she she would make it obvious what she were doing (so I had to try to cum as quickly as possible as to save us from embarrassment), have sex in an empty classroom, and have me cum inside her pussy during lunch time because she loves the feeling of it leaking down her panty hose in public - the list can go on. I guess it's true about girls who go to an all girls catholic school. I just thought these were typical exhibitionist things that I’m sure many girls dream of doing.


When things got serious and we knew we were the one for each other, she eventually told me that she used to touch herself to hentai and read a lot of short stories. That's where she got her desires by reading about it since she didn't like watching porn. In the meantime, I’ve gotten used to her numerous sexual cravings. I even shared my kink and she thought it was totally normal that everyone does. She fully indulges it to this day and is the best I’ve ever at it. 


Fast forward a few years later, move to the states together and we get married. I thought she was already kinky enough and that we were having the best sex I've could ever dream of; she shyly opens the idea of another girl. Later, she even once accidentally moaned a classmate’s name during one of her orgasms, where before she would only scream my name. At first I was offended and thought she might be lesbian or bisexual (nothing wrong with that but I would be nice to know ahead of time). I thought she was acting like she wanted a threesome to fulfill every guy's fantasy or that she could experiment with another girl since she wants bigger breasts. At first, she would keep asking me about my past relationships and how far I got with each girl over and over. In my head, I was thinking that just wants to be hurt so she would have an emotional noose around my neck. Maybe she just wanted to do the same things as them but even better since she is super competitive. 


Eventually, I tell her over the next months due to her persistence while in bed because this was the quickest way to be able to make her cum to exhaustion. She would get so horny, extra wet, and begged for me to tell her of my escapades to get her to cum really hard. If I didn't talk about it during sex, she would need me to keep fucking her till she came multiple times, at least 3-6x till was tired and finally satisfied. We eventually would watch porn together as that was a huge turn on for me and to kind of add that “3rd party” voyeurism. We watch some JAV boy, girl and in a month or two she told me the she doesn't like seeing the face and dicks of other guys as it would turn her off because it would break her imagination that it was me in the scene. She wanted lesbian porn where one girl would be harassed, forced, or humiliated by the other girl. I put two and two together (1: imaging me having sex with other girls & 2: her getting off to that idea) and thought she was like a hot wife but the opposite. I told her what is a hot wife but she is like the opposite as in she wants to share me, so I googled it and eventually I find the term cuckquean (a wife who wants to see her husband with other girls and is humiliated but that isn't always necessary). In the end, she kept asking about my sex life with other girls because she wanted to be super submissive. 


She reads about it and is pretty ecstatic because now she can look up short stories with the search term cuckquean and my name. I told her that if she only shared those feelings earlier while we were still in school. Because we knew a lot of girl who were jealous that she was with me. They would outright flirt with me in front of her at school even to the fact that she retaliated to one of the girls in public. I even got some messages on Facebook by girls asking me to visit them in their condo and girls who would talk to me when she wasn't around about meeting up. They would ask me why do you like her and invite to visit them in their condo for dinner or to watch tv. I would just laugh, tell them she is the sweetest, and then change the subject. One of my filam lesbian classmate/friend even told me that it’s hard for her to find someone because all the girls she would hang out with would just ask her questions about me.


I've been in about three relationships before; where in all three I was their first bf. All of them I have always been fully faithful. So, it was never in my nature to cheat on on my wife even when we were just dating. For the matter of fact that I was filam in another country I sure didn't want to piss off anyone and have their families after me as I was by myself. She said that before we got married she was still a bit insecure and worried that I might eventually leave her, that's why she waited till marriage to let me know about her kink. She even told me that in the Philippines, it's very common for guys to cheat on their SO while dating and even throughout marriage. Now that we are bonded in life, if I ever cheated, as long as she was informed about the side girl in advanced she would be okay with it as long as I always go back to her and only love her. I never had the urge to cheat on her or any of my relationships before. It was really an internal struggle to get on board with her kink at first.


So now she shares that fantasy of hers with me almost every time we have sex. She would pretend to be either one of those classmates or some random hot girl we saw that day. When we would watch porn, she would always have us choose one of the girls that I would fuck while we were having sex and she would imagine that she was an accessory for that girl's pleasure. During sex, she particularly likes to reach around underneath with her hand during doggy and fondle my balls as I fuck her. She wants me to imagine that I'm fucking another girl while she helps by pleasuring my balls and feel that contraction as I cum into another girl. She would often hide her face under a pillow and have me call her by a different name. She would even speak a third language that she learned or change her tone of voice. Some nights she would spontaneously give me head while I was sleeping and when I woke up she hold my chest down to prevent me from looking at her. In the morning, she would ask, ""so which girl made you cum last night?"" 


Her most desired fantasy is where she is totally hands off. She wants to watch me have sex with another girl while she is hiding off to the side or catches me in the act after she comes home from work. She would just watch, touch herself, and not bother us. Later it would be her turn to get fucked while the previous girl’s juices are on my cock and face. 
She encourages me to flirt with other girls which is kind of hard for me since I love her so much and very content with our lives. She has suggested numerous girls at work that she is willing to ask them if they wanted to get with me. She has even gone so far and talked to her older sister that she would like me to have sex with her since her sister has never gotten further than fingering. Both of them are very close but the sister shot it down because we are all close and things might get weird afterwards. During a family vacation, we shared a hotel room with only one bed with her sister while the parents were in another hotel room. She made me have sex with her while her sister was asleep next to us. She would arch her back and rub her ass on my cock and when it I couldn’t hide it, she pulled her shorts down and guided my cock inside. I didn’t want to rock the bed since it her sister was on one side, my wife in the middle, and me on the other side. She didn’t care and would thrust her hips into me while we spooned till I came. I just held down on her throat and shut her mouth to prevent her from moaning. It was pretty exhilarating to be honest and I’m pretty sure the sister knew and pretended to sleep.


There are some other scenarios she has been toying around in her mind after she finally experiences her hands-off fantasy. Like to see like another girl get fucked hard while begging for my cock like a slave/slut, a girl taking my cum shots either on the face, tits, or creampie and my wife would eats it off the girl because that cum belongs to her, another girl humiliating my wife while we have sex saying that she isn’t worthy of being with me, and also where my wife joins in assisting the girl without being degraded and pleasures me and anything cuckcake desires (that's the term for side girl). She’s pretty cute in my opinion because there is only one thing that is off limit that I can do with another girl - it has to do with my kink. She will eventually allow it if the girl is up to her standards but the girl isn’t allowed to do it to make me cum unless she says so at the moment - totally will respect her decision. 


So, that is my story on how I learned about an obscure genre. There are a lot of videos of threesomes but cuckqueans are usually not physically involved and has some emotional element to it like humiliation or even could be encouragement since she knows she is with a guy who can attract others. 


To those say that sex becomes boring after marriage, I guess I am an outlier. But yes sex has slowed down a bit since we are both working high pressure jobs after graduation and she is now on the pill. 

**TLDR: My wife confessed she is a cuckquean when we got married (In modern English it generally refers to a woman whose fetish is watching, and deriving sexual pleasure from watching, her man having sex with one or several women).**



**Update:**


Some of you might have noticed that I have posted this about 2 months ago. My wife and I are visitng the ph soon for vacation and for her to see her old friends. I deleted this story after we found a girl on phgw; she was perfect for us and she told us to get telegram to talk to her. She was really down to earth, super nice, and very pretty. First of all she asked to see pictures of me to know if she was attracted to my body and her type, which she said yes. In return, I asked for her to verify herself with the standard picture of your face with a written note. I asked about her profession and seems like she is well off in her corporate job. She is able to also take a lot of long weekends for her hobby. We offered her to go out to a spa day but she said she is just fine with a quick bite all together to see if we are compatible in person and to flirt with me in front of my wife. She then requested that just her and I go out drinking before going to the hotel. She said she doesn't really stay at fancy hotels because she has a condo and their family house nearby but is really excited to use the hot tub together. She is an avid runner so she isn’t the typical body type you see on phgw. She honestly could be one of the top girls of AGW. She explained to me why she only posts on phgw and would never consider AGW. She never asked for explicit photos besides the pictures of me after working out. She always shared her photos of herself in her ""outfit of the day"" and naked photos with full face when I asked them. She explained that she always had a thing for married guys and wanted to hook up with one for the first time. She particularly wanted me to wear my wedding ring the whole night. 


We had everything planned out and paid for one of the exclusive suite at a 5 star hotel near where she worked. Wife, her, and I were all on the same page. We all understood that this is no strings attached and she gets to pretend to be with a husband for a night and do anything she wants. She shared some of her kinks which I obliged and her only rule was that my wife was strictly just going to watch. We also agreed that we would lock my wife out in the living room of the suite for a while too so she can have alone time with me. She didn’t want to be touched by my wife since she isn’t a bi but she liked the idea of being watched. Which was totally fine since my wife only wants to watch. Plus my wife would only join though upon the request of the other girl after she gets to watch for a bit. We agreed that it would be multiple rounds of shower, hot tub, couch, floor, and bed sex; we'll try to stay up all night if we can. If she was game still she would even hang out and play some more the next day. The girl's only concern was that we planned this far too advanced of our trip to the Philippines  – almost 3 months in advanced. She said she wanted it to happen now. She also mentioned that she also wanted to take photos especially POV and videos so she could post them on phgw. 

Everything was fine and on track for a month and half or so. We kept in touch almost every two days just checking up on each other and sharing little things about our lives and our day. As we discussed at the very beginning of our chat we both were going to get STD tested. This was very important to me as she didn’t want to use condoms and I am in the medical field. I wanted to promote safe sex. I gave her all the resources from loveyourself to exactly which hospitals can test for more than HIV in her area. She agreed and said she was planning on getting tested actually. I got my results and shared it with her. I was all clean and I asked her when she would get tested. She replied next month when she has more free time. Well that time came and I followed up with her about the test and she has not replied. I can see that she is online on telegram and still active on reddit. She even told me before that she never ghosts people because that is “rude”, however she decided to do that to us.


I left her nice one last message since she never replied after I asked about the test, saying it was great getting to know her and fun chatting about the upcoming date; she never replied back. For me it was truly no hard feelings on my part, the last 2 months I was having mind blowing sex with my wife because she was excited I was about to hook up with another girl. However, my wife is now a bit pissed that we planned all of this to make the girl’s night extra special and suddenly she couldn’t give a reason to stop communicating. We just booked this hotel for her as we aren't staying at the hotel but at my wife's family home. I was kind of relieved since this would be my first hook up ever and it was going to be with a girl who is practically runs a marathon every weekend. But all that talking back and forth did get me really horny for it too and it gave me the motivation to lift harder and add more cardio to my workouts. The let down was really to my wife. 

We are thinking of downloading tinder just before our trip instead since we heard that app is more for hook ups. I know some of you would say just find a high end escort but part of my wife’s kink is that I am able to find hook up with a girl without have to resort to paying. Also, we would like to find a really down to earth girl with her own personal kinks that we can help her achieve too. 

I told my wife that it’s fine and if we don’t find a girl to replace her. Since we would have a special night together in a 5 star hotel to enjoy each other. I am sure we would need to get away from her parents and relatives for one night after being with them throughout our vacation. So here is to May that we might find another girl again for my wife's kink.

**Update:**

The phgw girl saw my this post  and replied to me on telegram. We both mutually agree that we should not push through since her reason is legitimate and for her health. I truly wish the best for her. She wishes the best of luck to me and my wife in finding another girl too.

**Update 5/10**
Met with a girl twice and it turned out great. Wife and I will write about it eventually.",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/bgql2d/would_you_let_your_gfwife_share_you_with_another/,t2_a85myh3,1556081975.0
