Domestic violence against men is not a fucking joke,"I was having a drink with my friend when she mentioned that she had seen one of our mutual acquaintance's boyfriend with a black eye. She said she'd asked him how he got it to which he replied that his girlfriend did it to him. She then started laughing like it was something hilarious. I said to her that it's not a joke, and that if it was his girlfriend with the black eye she wouldn't be laughing. She then said ""well yeah obviously what kind of man gets beaten up by his woman"". I couldn't believe it and was starting to get more irritable, I replied that people like her is the reason men don't come forward to report domestic violence against them. She laughed again and said that domestic violence against men is minuscule compared to cases against women. I tried to explain to her that that is partly due to under reporting but it wasn't registering with her. She just kept laughing and saying how she can't believe a man can't defend himself against a woman who's physically weaker. She could see I was becoming more and more irritated by her views so she dropped it. 

Domestic violence against men is not a god damn laughing matter and people need to encourage men to come forward when suffering rather than making them feel ashamed and embarrassed.

The worst case of domestic violence I have ever seen. (Trigger Warning:Domestic Violence),"Sorry if this is in the wrong sub. Also not my throwaway because life happens and sometimes it sucks. This happened about 7 years ago. 

Here it goes:

36 year old guy with a wife and 2 year old on a US military post across the pond. He had come back from an overseas tour about 9 months prior and instead of going to see the head doc he ate and drank his problems away. He got fat and got put in remedial pt and the weight control program. Steroids came into play about a month in and then came the PTSD and steroid induced rage. I'm a military police officer and get a welfare check since they lived on post. My partner and I knock on the door and when there was no answer we got permission to enter the residence. We open the door and the smell hit us hard. The guy had killed his wife and daughter after brutally beating them. He propped his wife's body on the couch and the most terrible part is he had his daughter's body in her bed under the covers tucked in with a bedtime book under her arm. That broke my fucking heart. We went to the motor pool where the guy worked and as soon as he saw us he starting crying and saying how sorry he was. We took him into custody and turned him over to CID. I went home and hugged my pillow and called everyone who meant something in my life at the time. 

TL; DR Just read the story you lazy prick",https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2hs6kd/the_worst_case_of_domestic_violence_i_have_ever/,t2_ghum0,1411993788.0
I saved a women from domestic violence,"I was delivering a pizza to this lady, but when I got up there I heard her screaming help and telling this boy to get out. I started to cry instantly just because I was in a situation similar to that and I guess it just triggered me. I went down and called the police. The boy was arrested. And the next day I get a thank you card from the girl. She said I saved her life. But, I still feel sad about the situation. I just hope she never gets in the same situation again.

I'm a male survivor of Domestic Violence..,"Going shopping was always stressful for me. I was never allowed to get what I wanted without permission. Sometimes I was told I couldn't get something because I didn't eat it last time, even if that was not true. Sometimes she would tell me she was not spending her money on that. I was never allowed to go shopping by myself without asking permission. I always had to have my phone on me ready to answer it if it rang. If I got the wrong brand I would be told how dumb and useless I was and how I never did anything right.  If I bought myself something not on the list, I would get questioned why I needed such item. Or asked why I didn't ask first. If I told her I made money too, she would always say how she made more money, or say that I was selfish and always spending money on myself or not her. Just depended on her mood. 

I couldn't fill my gas tank and always had to keep it under 20.00. I was never allowed to fill up. I would get yelled at if I did. 

Every month she would go through the paper bank  statement and question me on every purchase. What I bought there and why i needed it. If I couldn't answer or remember, she would continue to ask me why I couldn't remember if that's someplace I was…. She would count up the totals and tell me how much money I wasted. 

Eventually I opened up my own bank account on the side for me to manage because I felt like I didn't have access to money without being verbally and emotionally abused. I kept this account secret. Until I eventually told her which she always made statements about. Like I was selfish with my money and it didn't benefit the family. 

She would spend hundreds a month on house decor. When ever I brought it up, I would get screamed at. It was scary at times. She would tell me how I didn't have a say and It was for the house and whole family. I would be forced to go shopping with her. I wasn't allowed to stay home. Everything was fine for me If I didn't question or disagree with anything. 

If we got into an argument it was bad. She would tell me how useless I was, She would sometimes throw things, slam doors, hit me, and scream at the top of her lungs. If we were in the car she would pull over and tell me to get out and walk home when we were still really far away. I would refuse to but it felt like I was in danger. Once she picked up a hammer and threatened to hit me with it. I wasn't allowed to leave. She would hide my keys, phone and wallet from me. Depending which ones she could get. She would refuse to give them back until I apologized. Sometimes she would block the doorway so I couldn't leave. She would threaten me that if I called the police she would tell them I beat her. I couldn't afford that because I was a Police Officer and I would have been discharged from duty on bad terms and an internal investigation would have been done. I never hit her. 

 She was very good at lying and manipulating. She would cry alot. She could do it on purpose. She would tell me how the argument was all my fault for being so stupid. And it was my fault she reacted that way. At the end I believed her. I was useless. Stupid. Unattractive. Selfish. 

This was just part of my life on a daily basis. 

There is way more, but that would be a novel.

I was able to escape by running away. At the end she took my keys from me and hid them from me for weeks. I got divorced and im happily remarried now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/q6m801/im_a_male_survivor_of_domestic_violence/,t2_2njq7llz,1634045389.0
Not sure if I’m misunderstanding my boyfriend?? TW: Domestic violence ,"Hi. 

Okay. Two weeks ago there was a stabbing in the same neighborhood I live in. It was the husband who stabbed his wife to death. The husband told police that he “went mad, and that she didn’t listen to him/would not listen to him”

I was telling my boyfriend about it because it happened so near to where I live and I have talked to the husband and wife before.  

So he said that he understands that the husband would do that. He said that when your wife isn’t listening to you and you got all this pent up rage then it makes sense to stab her.

I was like: there is no good reason to stab your wife unless it’s self defense (like she is running towards you with a loaded gun or like she is attacking with a machete or something) 

He said there “it is a good reason to stab your wife. She was probably pushing all his buttons, didn’t listen to what he was saying, accusing him of stuff, etc. “

I changed the topic because I really didn’t know what to do with that information? Guys, btw, I’m slow. I am naiive.  Shit goes over my head. I don’t know something is bad or wrong until a lot later, I  feel like I don’t know how social interactions work, etc lol. 

Well we got into a text argument a week later and he was telling me I know exactly what to say to get him mad, I know exactly how to push his buttons, I don’t listen to him…

Basically the same shit that he said two weeks ago that he understands why the husband did it 

What the fuck is this? 
Is he saying I’m worthy of being stabbed?
Am I misinterpreting??

I can’t tell anyone this.

I took a flower from a domestic violence awareness thing,"So a while ago i was getting home when i saw a bundle of purple paper flowers outside a hotel, they had a tag with the companys name on them so i thought ""oh thats a neat way to advertise"" and took one of them.\*

Later on the train i saw a poster about domestic violence with purple ribbons on it, and remembered wich day it was. I felt really guilty but it was too late to return it to the display.

Also two people there saw me taking the flower + the security camera and i must have looked like a disrespectful asshole.

I laughed during sex last night sporting a black eye and scratches from domestic violence.,"3 days ago my father beat me into a black eye, tears on my neck, a contusion in my wrist, and deep bruise in my heel. I decided it's time to leave, am staying at my aunt's, and am moving in with a friend in September. 

I've been seeing a guy that oddly fits most boxes of my ideal guy. As those of you who've dealt with abuse and mental health issues, you know it can seriously carry over into your relationships and ruin them quite often. I am falling for this man so hard I have refused to let it leak into that. 

Yesterday he asked me to hang out, so I caked my eye with concealer because I wanted the time with him so badly but telling him what I'm dealing with would be too much too soon honestly. We just talked for hours, ordered food, listened to music, and watched a movie. I had a couple drinks but was dead sober. He kept asking me if I was tipsy already because I was so happy and giggly, honestly the most I've smiled in weeks. 

Eventually we started hooking up, completely naked on each other nearly to the actual sex, and for some reason we both got unrelated giggles. We then laughed about having the giggles butt-ass naked and devolved into a whole laughing fit for like 5 minutes. I then inhaled a bug as we got ourselves together and nearly had to hack up a lung a minute later.

I saw a comment a while back about how nice it is to be able to comfortably laugh during sex because you feel safe with your partner. His presence feels like a favorite childhood blanket. I can't explain it much else. My friends and extended family have been wonderful, but it's really nice to have a light right now that isn't involved and just makes me feel so happy.

EDIT: thank you so much for all the kind replies. We hung out again last night and he noticed the scratches on my neck but I played it off. I really don’t want to scare him off with it. But I cleaned up his apartment a bit, he cooked me dinner, we listened to music and booked more stuff for the trip. There was a moment I thought he was going to say something about us but he didn’t. I just hope this continues.",https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/hywq3a/i_laughed_during_sex_last_night_sporting_a_black/,t2_15s223,1595871063.0
(!TW!) Where does domestic violence begin?,"I just can't get a thought out of my mind lately. It's always coming back and I end up thinking about it again. Here's the thing...

... My ex partner (we had been together for 4 years) broke up with me last year after cheating on me and wanting her instead of me later on. It took me quite a while to get back on track, because it was literally something I would've *never* expected. 

(Trigger warning again!)

But, now that I'm slowly processing all of these feelings connected to this ended relationship, I find myself questioning wether or not there's a ""non physical"" (?) form of domestic violence - that isn't quite psychological terror, nor active violence. Because lately I've noticed how much loud voices, shouting or arguing can trigger major anxiety in me. That's not how it always used to be! Now I end up shaking, totally stressed out, wanting to crawl underneath the next table/chair if something like this happens.

So, my expartner *never* actually hit me. He hit the bedroom door once, punching a hole into it because he snapped. This was the worst that happened. But he used to become very loud, very intimidating and behaved aggresively when we were arguing. He shoved me out of the way two or three times, but never hurt me physically. He was ""gentle"" doing what he did, but it was still very unpleasant. Apparently my brain reacted to these situations and now reacts with anxiety and a direct connection to my fight, flight or freeze response if similar situations turn up. 

I do have the feeling my ex did not act like this ""on purpose"" to terrorize me psychologically. He has a history of anger issues (had no problems with it anymore when I met him) and is quite the hot tempered person anyways. Yet I don't know if that's already crossing the fine line between actual domestic violence or something that's somewhere inbetween. 

Maybe you can help finally sort this out in my brain because it's kinda driving me crazy. Weird, I know. But my ADHD brain does work weird sometimes.",https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/15l0fff/tw_where_does_domestic_violence_begin/,t2_e8kwv1fo,1691450020.0

I am living in a rental above a domestic violence situation and it’s affecting my mental health *TW domestic violence*,"For the last 2 1/2 years I’ve lived in an upper/lower apartment. It’s just two units, I rent the upper, and a couple rents the lower part. The walls are pretty thin, but noise is something that I have always understood comes with rental life. The first night this couple moved in, around 4 in the morning I started hearing a commotion downstairs, but was still semi asleep so I attributed it to them just still moving in and didn’t think much of it until about 15 minutes later I started hearing her screaming and the thuds I heard downstairs sounded like running and then another loud thud and a scream, and I sat up in bed and this was my first experience with these two getting into physical altercations. Every time this has happened it is a very clear struggle: 

He starts yelling at her, calling her terrible names, she is crying or telling him to get out, he gets angry and I begin to stop hearing voices and start hearing what I can most easily describe and two bodies struggling. It sounds like when you’re play fighting with someone or pushing someone and someone else is pushing against you—feet and bodies shuffling/struggling. Their floors are wood and I can hear every thud of their feet, and it’s easy to tell when he slams her into walls, or she falls. I can hear thuds that sound like punches, and things breaking in their apartment as the struggles happen. 

She also usually screams telling him to stop, saying “you’re hitting me stop stop” and “I can’t believe you hit me” “you’re hurting me” and “I’m scared please stop” and things that clearly indicate to me that not only is there a struggle, but there is one that involves physicality that is hurting her. Every time I have heard this, I have called the cops because of her screaming and because the struggles make my floors shake and all of these things has me concerned majorly for her safety—no exaggeration, my floors in my upstairs rattle..that’s how extremely it seems like she is being tossed around. Everytime the cops come, he flees before they come and she is left sobbing somewhere downstairs but she pretends she isn’t home and never lets the cops in. Her mom came one time screaming and pounding to let her in, (she must’ve called her mom as it was happening) and she was supposed to leave with her mom with a protective order against him for 48 hours, as explained to me by the cop, but the next morning they were both back together and the DV situations continued. I have also had friends over when this has happened. I am a single female living alone and to be honest the guy below me scares me and I am just at a loss of ways to help her. He has ran up to my car at 2 in the morning extremely drunk when I get home from the gym after work trying to talk to me, has followed me on socials asking me to do work business with him, left things in my mailbox, stood at my door while I was at work calling me on socials (I have a ring doorbell) and overall the neighborhood I live in is really sketchy and I’ve had a ton of unsafe things happen to my house that I’ve caught on my ring and I am also concerned for my safety getting involved. I always try to talk loudly through the walls after he flees to tell her that she is strong and doesn’t deserve the treatment I hear, and she can get out, but I don’t know how else to help. Over the years I’ve heard her on the phone talking to people on the porch (I sit and eat outside on my porch and can overhear her talking often) about how she is lonely and her family doesn’t talk to her anymore so I know her lifelines here are dwindling..

They now have a baby though, and so that puts a new twist onto things. There was another incident yesterday, and my friend was over. It got physical pretty quickly and we both didn’t know what to do, I had also heard what I thought was her screaming “then go get your gun then motherf***er you need HELP” which made us both extremely scared as a struggle with a gun could end poorly for her and the baby, and also possibly my safety if the gun is shot in a struggle upwards into my apartment. He fled the scene and I sent her a message telling her that I needed to know she was okay and saying she can tell me a safe word and she can yell it if she feels unsafe and I will call on a moments notice and try to help her. She responded saying that “everyone goes through things and if she needed help she would’ve done it herself”. So, I left it at that. 

I’m at a loss here trying to figure out ways to intervene that’s both safe for her and the baby, but also I am at the point where it truly is not my business. The issue is though that them being below me and him not being afraid to beat her while their neighbor (me) is home is making me involved and concerned for her safety and her babies and it’s affecting my mental health living here worrying about it all. It gives me anxiety and I am unsure how to deal with the stress of it and how to deal with just sitting complacently as it happens. I’ve already talked to cops regarding how to help her and unfortunately they said that I can’t do much if she’s not willing to work with me or them, or if I don’t have video proof, as audio itself is just hard to prove unless there’s physical/visual evidence to back it, and so I am just at a loss. The property management is aware as I have also sent an email describing what is happening, I just don’t want to make it worse for her but it’s hard living here. 

I just hate living here because of that situation, and I truly want to help, but I’ve tried and I know that it takes time and I’m really not trying to make it worse for her, just everytime there’s an abrupt silence down there during a struggle I’m genuinely worried he killed her. And I hate people who think it is okay to lay their hands on anyone. I have the absolutely utmost sympathy for DV survivors, I cannot imagine how hard it is to get out of it—you are all strong and you truly deserve more than what you might think you do and are stronger than you think you are. Love doesn’t hurt you. You are worthy of soft love. I want to hug all of you and wish I could help more.",https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/10i7pk5/i_am_living_in_a_rental_above_a_domestic_violence/,t2_s2jat1vm,1674351584.0
My domestic violence story,"In 3 days it will be a year since my fiancées death. My abusive fiancée. I was with him for 5 years. He was the love of my life, and he beat me. He insulted me. He caused a miscarriage because he beat me so hard. But I loved him dearly. He was an hard core addict, with psychotic tendencies. In 3 days it will be a year since he blind folded me and drove me a 3 counties away to a shitty hotel, tied me to the bed, pumped me full of drugs and stabbed me 4 times with his favorite pocket knife. I had stab wounds on my stomach, and breast. I pleaded with him, for my life, for our child’s. He told me that an angel had been whispering to him to do this for a few days now.  I was 32 weeks pregnant at the time. He got on his knees and cried and held my hand and told me I had to go to heaven now, and that id be with both my babies. I screamed but no one came out, it was in a bad part of town. He then went into the hotel bathroom, while I laid there bleeding, and got into the tub and slit his wrist. 

After a while I realized he wasn’t coming out, so I screamed and screamed and finally a cleaning lady came by. I was rushed to the hospital in critical condition, and forced into emergency C-section. God must’ve been watching over me, because my baby was born alive. He spent over a month in the NICU, but alive. I had one operation and several staples. I catch myself thinking and longing for the life I use to have. Before my fiancée went crazy, before drugs took over his life, before he started beating me. I never anticipated that that day would end so cruelly. Now I have ptsd and see a therapist 4 times a month.

I have been living with domestic violence and I don’t know how to escape it," My mother has Borderline Disorder and her mood swings are so intense that I don’t really know for sure if she cares about me and everyone else in the house or not anymore. She’s so caught up in her stress that she doesn’t bother to understand what any of us say how bad her actions are. And wow if she saw that I made this post she will either get extremely angry at me and might just hit me or just cry and assume that I don’t love about her. But I do, I love her  and I do care how she feels and I do understand how stressful things can be for her, which is why it’s so difficult for me to stand up for myself to her. Some of my siblings did, but whenever they said how they really felt towards her all she does is just calls them disrespectful and curses them. Even worse, she had threatened them a couple of times before, when I had to do the dishes with my sister she got angry with her and kept on talking back,and my mother got so angry she went up to her face and screamed at her. Saying that she would bang her head against the window if she kept it up. Which made her cry and my dad came inside the house and said that she was being way too loud and to calm down, and then she assumed that she only cried so that she can get away with what she did. 
  She argues with my dad the most, 24/7 I can hear them through the whole house. Which now just came to me that maybe the reason why my dad is not at home that much is not just because of work, it also might be because of her too. My dad doesn’t raise his voice that much all, mostly he tries his best to ignore her. He even tells her that if she keeps up acting like this then he might have to get the police involved, and whenever he does she says that he’s threatening and abusing her about the police and getting her taken away and gets so distressed about it. What upsets me the most is that she acts like she’s the victim all of the time, when she had done so many things that were wrong. A few years ago my two cousins came over, they were about 12 years old that time, and I can tell that they were traumatized by her. 
    Whenever she started yelling at my dad they began to cry and got scared, they got scared the most when they were in my bedroom and she had another argument with my dad and she pushed him down on the floor, they started screaming when that happened, and he tried to console them but my mother literally didn’t care how traumatized they were, she only cares how unsafe she feels, and sees herself as the victim in every situation. Many of the things she did also traumatized me, ever since I was in kindergarten I had this mental illness, but it’s not officially and disorder though. It’s called maladaptive daydreaming, overtime it grew stronger and it helped comfort me a lot. It distracted me from the things I went through in school and at home. I still do it for hours every day. Im sure I had this because of my childhood trauma, well even worse I’m still living in it. But there are times my mother is sweet and nice, there are times when she is very sweet, she told me that she is not okay whenever someone else in the house has an issue in their life and she would want to help with that, and she sometimes feels remorseful after she gets angry outbursts, but that usually happens after she’s done smoking cigarettes, which she is addicted to. 
      Years ago she even kept me and my sister in my room right after she made lunch because her cigarettes were missing and she thought that we took them. And I was STARVING,  I had to wait so long to eat what she cooked because it took a while for her to find them. And almost about a year ago she made me sandwiches when I never even asked and she was being very nice to me, but then minutes later she gets extremely angry for no reason and gets mad at me saying that I always gotta ask something from her. I don’t know what I did to make her that angry at all, usually she gets mad at everyone else in the house way more than she gets angry at me, mostly because I always have to be cautious to what I say to her, because her mood is unpredictable. But this morning she started yelling at my dad again, and my brother had visit to stay for a while, my dad and called him downstairs to ask him if he can calm her down. Unfortunately it just made things way worse, he tried his best to calm her down but of course she doesn’t listens and gets more angry. She even told my dad that all of this talk about don’t argue and yell in front of the children isn’t her biggest issue because she’s the real person who is getting abused about being threatened that my dad will get the police involved and that her childhood was ruined, despite the fact she’s literally ruining mine and my siblings childhood too. 
        When I came downstairs to eat today she saw how upset I was at her and she said oh sorry for being an annoyance to everyone here I will just leave and never come back because you hate me. I felt scared to do it but I told her that I don’t hate her and that all of her shouting and violent behavior is stressful to deal with everyday, she then told me that maybe if someone could help her and not everyone be so distant towards her maybe she wouldn’t be acting like this, and that it wasn’t fair for her and that she ruined her life giving birth to us and that she loves us for that. But I didn’t say anything and just left because what was I supposed to say or do about that? Especially to someone like her. Is it not fair that we have to be concerned for her despite everything that she has done to us? And my dad has to warn her about to police many times because she has been acting like this for so long, before I was even born, and I’m 16 now. But the police have been involved a few times before, the latest time was when I heard my mother outside constantly yelling don’t touch me over and over, loud enough that I’m pretty sure everyone else in the neighborhood had heard it, and it was like 3 in the morning. I went downstairs to see what was going on and she was just by herself having an emotional breakdown. She told me that she has been violated and beaten before and that call cops were bad and against her. I told her that how would she know and that it can’t be all of them that are bad, I doubt she believed that thought and she then said that if the cops come here anytime sooner don’t open the door or answer, and an hour later they did. They ranged the doorbell and my mom then whispered to me to not open it and eventually they left. But came back days later and told me that they would have to see her soon, which was because of all of the noise she was making that night. I mean I could go on and on of all of the other things she did but I don’t want to make this post that long. 
       After what she did today it made me realize that I don’t want to deal with this anymore, but there’s nothing I can do to stop it or make anything better. The only choice I have is to tell someone I trust like the teachers at my school or get therapy but it’s too risky because what if I get taken away from my home or if I lose everything I have right now.

My dog and I live in a domestic violence shelter,"Dear Reddit, I need advice. 

As title states, my dog and I live at a DV shelter. We have been here for over 8 months now and we will be here for a few more months [they’re helping with immigration to get ID so i can be independent but working with the government takes a long time] the problem is that I don’t get to take my dog out at night and I am ready to go back to live on the streets because I think it’s cruel and the strain on the relationship between my dog and I is destroying me and her mental health is declining fast. 

My dog and I have been homeless for a few years which means she got to go potty when she needed to. We mostly lived in the woods so she had a fun life watching animals and eating grass and zooming through hills. She always asked to go potty and never had an accident but I also always took her out the moment she asked. She was always leashed and never free roaming off leash. She never faked needing to use the restroom. 

When I’m sleeping she never asks to take her out but I can’t sleep much at night because the shelter is loud and I’m always afraid due to my cPTSD and so many people coming and going all the time who have a lot of problems of their own and it all just bounces between each other and it’s a very stressful place to live, especially long term. So I’m up after 2 hours of sleep usually trying to calm myself down just to get more sleep. 

Few months ago my dog stopped even asking me to go out. She doesn’t want to leave her crate [it’s her safe spot] she doesn’t want to make eye contact with people because most people ignore her. She barely wants to play and I try to instigate play everyday but she loses interest very quickly and is very unsure of herself. She was always so loving and happy and loved people and now I have to beg her to come out of her crate to go potty. She was always so confident and she rarely wags her tail now. It breaks my heart to see her in this state. I’m convinced that she’s no longer asking me to go out because I have to constantly tell her “no baby, we can’t go, they won’t let us” but she probably thinks I just don’t want to because she doesn’t understand. She rarely wants pets anymore and belly scratches are so rare now and it’s like she just endures is so I’m trying to respect her space and not push myself on her but she’s my only family and I know that all this might never be reversed now because the damage might be too far done but I am sure that things would be much better if they only allowed me to take her out when she needs to go. 

This place is corrupt and some people get to go outside at night to go smoke cigarettes but I’ve been here so long that no one takes me seriously anymore. It’s like all the new residents get so many free passes and special treatments and I just have to watch the injustice happen and I spoke up too many times about how unfair it is that they get to go smoke so they don’t like me and it’s up to “staff’s discretion” to let us out and they choose not to. I’ve spoken to our director about it and to the board members and they keep saying they’ll try to figure it out but everyday I’m just watching my dog dissociate and completely disconnect from everything around her. I can’t watch anymore. 

But if I leave then I will never get my ID and I won’t be able to get a job or really anything to have any independent life so I have to be here until all the paperwork is taken care of but I don’t know if I can. I’m just asking for advice on laws maybe or ideas on how to talk to the board in a better way because I always end up breaking down and they don’t take me seriously then but I’m hurting to see my dog hurting and I don’t know how to be “mature” about this. I’m in Ohio if that helps. Any advice of words of encouragement are welcome because I’m breaking. If you got this far, thank you, I feel like I’ve been talking to the wind.",https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/12q7gte/my_dog_and_i_live_in_a_domestic_violence_shelter/,t2_8gza541m,1681785893.0
I survived a horrible domestic violence situation and the police are doing something about it,"My abusive ex convinced me there is true evil in this world. 

He started out nice. Then he moved in. It immediately became a reign of terror. First manipulation, lies, gaslighting. He also pushed or ignored boundaries. Violated my privacy. Then preyed on my insecurities. Convinced me I was a terrible person and a terrible girlfriend. Made me jump through hoops to prove I was loyal, to earn his love. Only then he would he treat me well again. Only then could he love me as he did at the beginning. It escalated to me being under his constant control and sacrificing literally almost everything I had, including my life, to him.

There was no privacy, no boundaries, no respect, no love. I felt like a prisoner. I almost definitely had Stockholm syndrome. I couldn't escape because I had no money (he took all of it - he had no job), I was three years into a four year lease that I had no option of breaking without destroying my family financially (not an exaggeration), I had pets, and also: he utterly broke my spirit.

He was addicted to meth. He would binge meth for four or five days at a time. Then he would spend a week coming down. Then he would spend maybe two weeks off meth, if I was lucky. Even when he wasn't doing meth he was doing other drugs. But the meth made him act paranoid, delusional, violent, aggressive, hypersexual, stupid, and sadistic. Or maybe that's just who he is.

He would lock himself in the bathroom for hours at a time. He told me he needed ""alone time"" to ""meditate"" and that it was very important to his healing. This actually meant meth. It was my job to stay home, stay quiet, and keep an eye out - for hours, sometimes days - basically be available to him at ALL TIMES - because he kept hallucinating that the cops were outside.

Among other things, he cheated, stole money, lied, purposely sabotaged me, and gaslit me with indescribable expertise. I consider myself a smart person, but he completely pulled the wool over my eyes to the worst of his deeds even while I was battling the obvious bad shit. Probably what he has been doing all of his life to everyone. 

If I tried to leave him, he would concoct crises so I would have to drop everything and be with him/do what he wanted. If I didn't drop everything, he said it proved I didn't really care about him. Like one time I tried to leave him, and he jumped out a moving car and hurt himself so I had to take care of him.

Our arguments went on DAYS at a time, they were often nonsensical, and they were verbally and physically violent. 

My ex is a trained boxer and very, very fit. He's about six inches taller than me and (in the beginning) forty pounds heavier.

The first time he hit me, he rabbit punched me in the back of the head, twice, while my back was turned. It knocked me to the ground. I don't know why, but my response was to get up, brush myself off, and calmly say ""Wow."" I then walked away. He called me all night begging me to contact him. He tried everything, including claiming the police were coming for him and he needed me. I didn't respond. Came home the next morning and he was extremely angry I didn't look for him. He vacillated between berating me for not caring about him and apologizing in tears for punching me, which he blamed on the Xanax and on me provoking him. 

After that he took over the security cameras at my house and would watch me coming and out of the house. Sometimes when he was doing meth, he would see shadows on the security camera and hallucinate that they were images of people. Then he would scream and berate me for having men over to the house, for letting these shadow men crouch in the driveway, or hide under the bed, or creep up in the attic.

One night he let my dog out the front door and I chased after her. I came back and walked up the driveway with her in my arms. Unbeknownst to me he was hiding behind my car in the shadows. He jumped out and punched me several times in the stomach. I dropped my dog and she ran off. He kept punching me. One punch knocked me down and knocked the wind out of me. I gasped for him to stop but I couldn't catch my breath. But he got on top of me and kept punching me. I looked into his eyes and they were black. It was as if everything was going in slow motion. I realized he was going to kill me. I got my wind back and I immediately started screaming for help. I was lying on my back screaming and kicking and trying to wriggle away. He got up and ran away. 

I somehow managed to find my dog and I got back inside. I knew immediately my ribs were broken because it hurt so much to breathe. My body screamed with pain all over. He started banging on the front door. I tried to ignore it at first but he kept banging and ringing the doorbell over and over. I opened the door and he drunkenly fell through the threshold onto the floor. Then he got up, stumbled to the master bedroom, and flopped down on my bed. I started crying. I said ""You broke my ribs."" All I remember is him cackling and mocking my voice as he chanted back, ""You broke my ribs.""

Because of this nightmare, I lost the very, very nice and high-paying job I was working at. I was lying to everyone in my life because I was ashamed and I had no idea what to do. He was driving me to utter insanity. I lost weight until I was gaunt, part out of stress and part because he was taking most of my money, to the point where I didn't have enough to eat. I started getting sick all of the time. At the time I attended law school and I had been doing great. I failed all of my classes that semester because I couldn't even show up to my finals. And then I dropped out. I fell into a terrible depression that made me even less able to do anything about my situation.

I can't explain the nightmare I was in. It wasn't a relationship. I didn't love him. It was like living in hell. I was so tired, and my spirit was broken. I just started cooperating because I did not have the strength anymore to fight. And I did not have the resources to leave. I was locked into my lease for immutable reasons I won't explain here. I had no money and my credit, which was excellent before him, was shot. My friends were sick of listening to me cry, sick of showing up late at night to rescue me, sick of hearing me say I was really going to leave this time, only to see forgive him and give him another chance for reasons I struggle to explain. So by the end most of them didn't talk to me anymore.

I guess it took so long to leave because

1) I cared about him and I didn't want to be a ""bad girlfriend"" (because I wanted to lessen the abuse)

2) I feared him and I truly believed he would and could murder me on a whim if he discovered I betrayed him

3) I was ashamed to admit what an awful thing I had ""allowed"" to happen to me, and I persuaded myself of a reality where I could handle it

4) I thought he would die without me, because I found myself literally saving his life from his drinking or drugging many times

I lost my car, my life savings, many friendships, a job opportunity that would've paid $150k a year right out of school, my professional reputation, and some of my hair. I also have multiple scars on my face, and I have aching rib pain that won't go away. I find myself sitting up at night staring out the window wondering if he's lying in wait. If tonight is the night he comes to kill me.

I managed to leave after my lease ended. I purposely picked a place he could not follow me to. I didn't want to be confrontational because I was so terrified of him, and I found that if I played nice he sometimes did too. He did try to follow me, but I didn't let him. He also tried to turn my new roommates against me, but he was unsuccessful because they saw through it. Basically, he was forced to move back home five hours away because he could no longer stay at my house terrorizing me. He tried to get me to drive out to ""see him"" (actually to bring his stuff and give him money) but I refused.

I blocked him on everything. He tried to get around that for months and would leave me weird voicemails, mostly asking for money. He also told me he loved me. But none of those voicemails mentioned anything of substance, and never once did he utter the word ""sorry."" Not that it would have made a difference.

I believe I dated an actual psychopath. This post doesn't even begin to cover the truly fucked up, sadistic, and violent things this guy did to me and to other people. I believe, and my therapist agrees, that if I hadn't managed to leave when I did, I would've died in this relationship.

I reported all of this to the police recently. Six months after going no contact with him. I wrote a two-page statement with just the most important stuff and handed it over to this big, bald, tough-guy police officer. As he read it, all of the blood drained out of his face and his jaw became very rigid. I know it sounds strange, but it was incredibly validating to see a grown man so disturbed at the things I had just gone through.

They took me seriously. I honestly have never seen the police really take anything seriously. But they did, and I suddenly felt like I wasn't crazy and I didn't have to be quiet about any of this. I also have been working with a domestic violence counselor and the lawyers at my school (since, you know, law school) and they have been amazing. Literally the reason I am still alive now.

My ex is now under investigation for two felonies and two misdemeanors. I have a meeting next week to give a more detailed statement, and honestly, I've never felt better. His mom is a domestic violence advocate and so is his ex-wife. He has two elementary-aged kids that he claims to adore but doesn't prioritize (because meth is priority #1). I feel like this is going to ruin his life, and I think he deserves it, because he ruined mine.",https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/177cifs/i_survived_a_horrible_domestic_violence_situation/,t2_lixipcq3x,1697241691.0
My friends left because I spoke out about domestic violence from my partner,"So a few days ago I had a fight with my partner and decided that it was the last straw... that I couldn't take the relationship anymore. My partner and I play D&D and I couldn't have played on the same table as him after that, so I shot the group a message saying, ""Hey, I'm sorry, but John and I broke up. I won't be able to play anymore, because I need some time to heal.""

These friends knew I was a victim of domestic violence but they never knew from whom, because I never divulged that it was my partner. All they knew was that it was from a family friend who I couldn't escape from. I used to ask them for advice after beatings, when I was crying and wondering what to do. Now I can't escape the thought that maybe if I just never asked for help, they wouldn't have left.

Some of them messaged me to show me their support, saying, ""Hey, I'm sorry about the break-up. What happened, is this related to the domestic abuse?"" And... I did the dumbest thing. I answered, saying, yes, it was. One thing led to another and I ended up explaining my problems about the relationship.

My partner and I were together for 4 years, what I think is a pretty respectable amount of time. And don't think my partner is a bad guy, just... troubled. By me, especially. We had planned a party coming up in early August for a D&D game, and I was part of the preparation for that. Eventually I steeled myself and thought, I might as well continue preparing for the party... all our effort would have been such a waste if I just left it there.

I messaged our friends that John wasn't a bad friend, just a bad partner, and that I've decided I was going to go to the party with everyone and would be happy to play with them again, at least for a bit. I'd told them I would really appreciate it if they were on speaking terms with John, but I'd understand if they weren't, and that if they still played at our table, it wouldn't mean they agreed with what he did.

They said they would talk to my partner, and I understood why and was fine with it, because both John and I were a big part of the group, even separately. So they spoke with him, and later on in the day I got a message from them saying they couldn't associate with both of us anymore because the situation made them terribly uncomfortable, and they didn't want to be connected to it anymore.

Before anything, I just want to say... I respect their decisions, I just... feel so ashamed and hurt that they thought that. They were never really connected to the situation, my partner and I had treated them like we always did, with understanding, love, and respect, even after the break-up. I don't even blame John. He cared about me and I know that he regretted what he did, but because of what he did, we were broken up. That's all...

I thought the break-up was just between the two of us. And I never expected them to show me unwavering support. I wished them the best, but they just blocked me, and that... hurt so much. I don't understand what I did wrong. I think I should have just stayed quiet about the domestic abuse, then this would have never happened. Maybe it would have continued, but I at least wouldn't have lost everyone that mattered to me.

A few of them have been telling me that all I've lost was D&D night every week and that I should focus on things that matter, but I feel like I've lost a lot more than that. Our friends and I were never able to see each other often, at most a couple times every year. D&D was my only connection to them beyond that, we shared happy moments with each other and were able to speak freely with each other.

Or so I thought. I feel so hollow and empty right now. This isn't the first time I've been kicked out of a group for asking for help. The first time it was said to be a ""mismatch of expectations,"" expectations that were never drawn out or acknowledged in the first place so I had no clue about it, I just thought those people were my friends, too...

I've spent so long just crying and thinking about everything. I can't sleep. I've lost so much today, and I don't know where I went wrong.",https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/15fpu1o/my_friends_left_because_i_spoke_out_about/,t2_f9j78e63,1690926281.0
"I probably got labeled the block ""Karen"" tonight. And I really don't give a fuck. (TW: Domestic Violence)","I'm normally someone who minds their own business. I don't like most people for various reasons, and because they tend to irritate me, I just find avoiding the entire situation in theirs and my best interests. I never say hello to my neighbors; I prefer to live my life in quiet, reflective solitude. But tonight I broke my own rule, because as I sat on my back porch, I was drug back into a world that I thought I had left far behind.
 

 
There's a dark history associated with the military and domestic violence. Most people remain blissfully ignorant of this, and an unlucky few of us have seen just how badly it can go when you turn a blind eye. The year I entered the service in my small little community, there was a murder-suicide. Now I'm fuzzy to this day on all the details, but I do know the end result. The husband shot his wife, another adult male presumed her boyfriend, before turning his weapon on himself. A few months after that, another stabbed their spouse multiple times, not two houses down from where I lived. I always wondered if anyone had heard what was happening in those houses. I pondered often on the nights when I can't sleep, which are far more than I care to admit. If someone had the courage back then to speak up, would those people still be here?
 

 
Next year will be 20 years since that senseless violence took place. Tonight, I broke my own rules and got involved. I heard the screaming, her pleading, and the crashes. I couldn't stay silent; I couldn't potentially let another person lose their life when they didn't have to. So I called the police, and perhaps I sealed my reputation in our post-housing neighborhood. I will probably be ostracized now more than my self-imposed choices, but I'm ok with that. Call me Karen or call me whatever you will; I don't care. Maybe I was wrong for calling, but if I am, then I would rather be wrong than right and not have done anything.
 
 

I'm writing this because I suppose to let the men and women out there be abused tonight, or have been that I hear you, I see you, and if I can, I won't let you suffer alone. October is domestic violence awareness month. I'm a domestic violence survivor myself, and you have not been forgotten.",https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/172u3a8/i_probably_got_labeled_the_block_karen_tonight/,t2_ca47mz76,1696754057.0
domestic violence and the truth,"I need to vent.  This situation I have found myself in makes me want to scream.
Let me start from the start. John (53) and I (51)  have been together almost 12 years. We have had our ups and downs that is no lie. Both of us are recovering addicts. In 2017 we moved in with John's mom after I sold my home because she was falling all the time. She developed cancer shortly after that. I was her soul caregiver for the next 4 years. During that time John began seeing his old friends. I was pretty much confined to the house in order to care for mom. Our relationship was suffering and John began using again. 
It took me a while to catch on. His behavior becoming irrational, erratically unpredictable, and hostile was a tell tale sign. 
On September 1 2019 everything cr to a head. I noticed my deceased  father's military collection missing. John stayed most of his time out in a camping trailer on the property..his man cave.  
It was late and I went out to confront him. He absolutely flipped out on me. Demanding me to leave. Refused to answer me about the missing collection. I was so mad.. angrier than I've ever been. The fact that I was taking care of his mom with absolutely no help..his attitude and the missing items were more than I could handle. I refused to leave. He threatened me at gun point. Threatened to burn me with a touch. Grabbed me ripping my clothes. He never hit me but pushed me out of the trailer door. I kicked over his motor cycle prompting a chase to the house. I ran to the bedroom locked the door and called the police.
They interviewed me and automatically charged John with assault and a slew of other charges..I believe 11 total.
If they got a conviction on them all he would be looking at life. 
I was supena by a grand jury. By this time things had calmed. I told them that I could not remember all the details which was true. I have PTSD and dissociative disorder. I mentally check out under extreme stress.
The grand jury indicted John on all charges.
Now here's the thing that pisses me off to the 9s..and I want you to keep this in mind because it's going to all this together later.
They never came looking for John. Not once. Not ever.
The assault happened Sept 2019. They put an APB out for him at that time. I even called later in the month and said he was at the house come and get him. Nothing. A police car drove down our culdesac never making contact. He was in his man cave the whole time.
Anyways..the plot thickens...
A year later on September 20th 2020 I go out to give John some lunch and he's laying back on the sofa in the trailer holding his head. Begging me to bring him some aspirin. He's got the worst headache of his life he said. I bring him out his aspirin and go back inside. After feeding mom I lay down to take a nap and about an hour later John comes inside. He says something's wrong Vickie. My head hurts so bad. I tell him to lay down for a bit thinking it's a migraine.. shortly after he tells me to take him to the hospital. Come to find out John had suffered a brain aneurysm. The hospital life flighted him to OHSU in Portland Oregon. His blood pressure was through the rough and no matter what they did or how much medicine they gave him they couldn't get it to go down. He spent 6 weeks in the neurological ICU. He developed pneumonia, amongst other complications. He almost died many times. I was there everyday..one day I left and he had 3 machines monitoring him and 9 hours later when I returned there were 16.
They finally were able to go in and clamp the bleed. But then his whole head swelled up and he was leaking spinal fluid out of his incision in his head. They had to go back in and put in a tube that runs from his brain into his stomach. It will be working the rest of his life because his brain can't stop pulling in the fluid. 
During this time  I was torn. I loved John but I didn't like him. He was a cruel sob. I actually asked God to either make him a better man or take him from this world and save those around him from his abuse.
We didn't know if John would be able to walk or talk..toilet or feed himself.
John woke up with nothing but a shuffle to his walk and a slight speech impediment. But here's the kicker. He was totally different. He was sweet and kind, loving and appreciative.  I was in shock. I kept asking if this was going to wear off..they couldn't give me an answer. 
John couldn't remember a lot of things..including the last 6 weeks of his life. He didn't remember me selling my house or moving in with mom. He didn't remember mom was sick or that he was wanted for assault. He had no recollection of the incident at all.
They discharged him from the hospital late October 2020.  He has been my world ever since. I can't tell you why ..all I can say is God answers prayer.
So let's jump to July of 2021. Mom had died of Cancer at the beginning of May. John was at a friend's house when the friends next door neighbor gets raided. The friend and his neighbor shared a garage together so they took everyone's name. John gets Arrested on the assault from 2019.
They let him out on OR and give him a no contact order. He and I were not to have any contact at all. Period. None.
We were getting ready to buy our home in another county in Oregon. We had to sign papers. We had all our stuff in storage. There is no way we can uphold that order. Not to mention I didn't want more did I need the courts involvement.  John and I were happy. He was drug free. He even quit smoking cigarettes. He was and is a huge teddy bear that would do anything for me.
We went ahead and bought our home and John was going back to Marion County for court dates. They gave him 2 psychiatric evaluations. The first one concluded that he suffered memory loss from the aneurysm and could not aid in his own defense. The second one that the state of Oregon District attorney ordered came back inconclusive.
He has trial in Dec. 
We had police contact due to some unrelated issue with a friend I had staying with us 2 weeks ago. They ran John's name and arrested him for contempt of court for violating the NCO from Marion County.
I had him bailed out. We have court trial in late December.
Here's what bothers me. It has been over 3 damn years since the domestic issue  occurred. Never once did they lift a finger let alone try to apprehend him. They only got him by sheer luck. Now after all this time and all that has transpired they want to protect me!!??? Are you serious!? Now they want to play this stupid game!? They aren't protecting me from an abuser. They aren't protecting society from a horrible assailant. They are doing nothing but destroying a family. 
There are also 2 issues they don't know..
Number 1. Since all this happened my health has gone. I have liver failure, diabetes, and congestive heart failure. John takes care of me. I have no one else in this world but him. My daughter is 4 hours away. There rest of my family have passed.
Number 2. ..80% of people who survive the type of aneurysm John suffered die with in the first 5 years..
If they wait there won't be any victim or defendant to prosecute!!!
Tonight I had a sheriff at my door to serve me a supena for the December trial. John answered the door..he just doesn't think sometimes. I took him to a friend's when the officer left. But I know he seen John..and here we go again. 
I realize domestic violence is no joke. Those laws and procedures are there for a reason. But at the same time the need to listen. Read in all evidence. Not just see what's on paper .. especially when the alleged victim ( I hate that word) is telling them they need to reassess the situation. 
I can tell you this. If they take John from me and he died in there.  I'm going with him. I won't live out here with out him. I see no reason to. He has become the most gentlest màn I have ever known. 
Things change. People change. I just don't know how to make them listen and hear me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/yh5sp0/domestic_violence_and_the_truth/,t2_725dmpzk,1667108744.0
Domestic violence,"Hello all,
I am in a pretty serious domestic violence relationship me (23F) and him (28M) that has been going on for a year. During which I have momentarily vented to family and friends (about the more palatable situations) recently things have become a lot worse and I cannot properly leave him due to us living together so I am seeking alternative living situations. After a whole lot of nonsense we got back together and I now realise he has no remorse for his actions toward me and if anything it was a plot to seclude me. I spoke to him about this and he screamed out the windows “She’s crazy! Someone help me! She’s mental!” Etc which completely threw me off guard to which he said that “no one would believe me because maybe the neighbours have already called the police on me. I called my sister for advice and she told me that she had no interest in helping as “her and my parents knew I was in a dangerous situation and it was cruel to drag them into it”. I am very much thinking of just taking my own life. If anyone has had a similar confession and has seen the light please let me know because I can’t handle it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/t45lsw/domestic_violence/,t2_dw0ivi1r,1646133204.0

my partner hurt me and i am so lonely and conflicted (TW: domestic violence and attempted SA),"Throwaway account because i think my (23NB) (ex) partner (24NB) sometimes uses reddit?

We were both very open about our mental health struggles from our initial meet, but I didn't think it would turn out this way and my (ex) assured me that this wasn't the case about them. Sorry if this is less than exceptional writing, I've been unable to sleep for quite some time since it happened. 

They assured me that despite the mental health challenges we were both open about, theirs never translated into harming others around them, just self destructive behavior at the most. However, they ended up being someone who binge drank often and went on some sort of alcohol bender for several days before getting physical with me in a public space (a popular club in our city). We had been dating for about 5 months at this point). Without getting into too many details in case they see this, I was hit in the face several times as well as other forms of physical violence and attempted sexual assault. There were several outside stressors in their life that compounded that night that I don't mean to discount, but at the same time I have been through incredibly similar traumas as were happening to them at that time and never physically harmed anyone as a result. 

After this occurred, their reaction has been incredibly disappointing. They have been posting on several social media sites saying how much they hate themselves and want to die - they have been actively lying to all of their friends and acquaintances about what happened, and as a result have been receiving emotional and financial support for what people seem to see as them struggling with their mental health and nothing else. I am not the type of person to post such personal business on social media, especially to near strangers, but seeing them get so much support from people is starting to hurt me deeply, and I've never felt so lonely. I have been through worse at the hands of former partners and I can handle myself, but I wish that I had some independent support. To make matters worse, my (ex) partner and I work together, and somehow me telling them at least three times that I absolutely need them to find another job hasn't stuck. Despite our boss and several coworkers knowing that they physically hurt me, they insist at staying at this job and my boss is unable to fire them unless I directly say I need that to happen, because if my ex was currently fired with no backup it would legally be retaliation since I have only casually told my boss a few details of what occurred. I am currently in a much more financially privileged position than my ex and they have made it very clear to me that if I were to get them fired they would essentially be homeless and it would be my fault.

Sorry for the rant. I am unsure what to do, and despite having been through worse from some of my other exes, this one hurts more due to how much I trusted them initially. Any advice is appreciated.

I lost a lot of friends after being the victim of Domestic Violence.,"It is really weighing on me today, because I realize just how many of my friends have been insensitive to my abuse.

All of our mutuals, except for one, have been cut off, because they don’t want to “pick sides”. 

Okay, go be friends with my abuser, then, and leave me alone.

Or these questions, verbatim - 

*What did you do that made her want to hit you?*

*You’re a big guy, it’s really not that big of a deal that she hit you.*

*She was crazy, you should’ve known that would happen.*

I’m tired of people minimizing it because of my gender, my size, and my strength. Nothing entitles you to strike your partner in anger. If you do, you’re a rotten piece of shit.

I am so glad, yet so torn, to have had to remove these people that I truly care about from my life.

It’s like, “Good riddance, I’ll miss you.”

Just needed to get that out. Thanks for reading.",https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/10y1v5j/i_lost_a_lot_of_friends_after_being_the_victim_of/,t2_1lfgr0m,1675966803.0

I witnessed domestic violence and I'm not okay,"Tw : abuse, domestic violence

I left an extremely abusive relationship in 2017. It ended horribly with the police needing to be called. I am still recovering and healing from that relationship to this day. I find myself less triggered by tv shows and movies that show abuse. Today I had a triggering experience and I don't know who I can talk to about it. I'm posting here to get it off my chest. 

Today we (my fiancé and our 2 kids) were all relaxing about the house. Not really doing anything but relaxing and eating turkey leftovers. My fiancé was heading to the living room and I was relaxing on the couch in the living room. As he was headed into the room, we could hear shouting from outside. We live in a really safe area. We didn't think anything of it until we heard profanities. I can literally hear word for word and these walls are thick. I cannot hear anything upstairs that is happening downstairs. I could be shouting and won't be heard. 

My fiancé goes to the window by the couch and said ""Honey, there is a man out here and he's shouting at a woman. He's in her face. He's grabbing her arm rough. He's shouting really really loud and cussing. He's shoving her."" My fiancé is giving me the play by play and I don't know what to do. Then I see red. I hear him getting louder and more angry and it brings up my trauma. I know he's close to snapping and hurting her in a way I woukd never forgive myself for. 

I go upstairs and call 911. I can barely speak. My sentences sound like I'm out of breath but I haven't been running. My heart is in overdrive as I'm barely able to get our address out. I say there is a domestic altercation taking place outside of our home. I said ""please hurry and get here. He's going to hurt her more. He's grabbing her arm. He's shouting at her. He keeps pushing her."" the 911 dispatcher keeps asking for more information that I don't have. My fiancé is giving me the answers because I know the second I look I'm going to come to her defense in a way that I can't back down from and I'm not sure I will make it out of. I'm going up and down the stairs now. I'm trying to get a good angle on where they are at. She walked in front of our porch camera just barely enough but then he forcibly yanks her out of the camera shot. I couldn't get his face on camera. Fudge. Note to self, order 3 more cameras. 

I am still on the phone with 911. Why is it taking so long? She's literally getting shouted at, cursed at, ynsked around and he's only escalating his anger while she just keeps shouting no, stop and don't hurt me. Why aren't any of my neighbors outside? What is happening? I finally went outside. I can't take hearing her plead and not know if anyone is on her side. I walk to the curb, I'm shaking. He sees me and I see him. This coward. Beating on a young woman. I shouted ""you need to get your f*cking hands off of her!"" just as he throws her into a huge mailbox station. He tells me ""this is my f*cking girlfriend. This matter is between us and is none of your business."" I had 3 choices- confrontation, walk away or ask him to release her to me and then the police can sort it out. Then out of nowhere, a voice comes from the phone that snaps me out of my trance - the dispatch woman switches to her mom voice and I can tell I'm in trouble (if that makes sense). She is shouting ""ma'am get inside your house. You have no idea if he has a gun. You have no idea if he is armed or has friends or people there. Please return to your home. The officers will be there soon."" 

I retreat to my house after watching the guy go down the row of houses behind mine while yanking the woman. I didn't catch the exact house he went into. I am still on the phone with 911. I feel like crying.. I feel like something is off. I go up the stairs to a side window. I'm watching that row of houses when suddenly a car leaves their road doing about 60mph in a 25mph. He peels out from a stop sign. I tell 911 this and she tells me they had the roads blocked off just in case. Then she said she was going to hang up now as an officer was in the area. 

I don't know the outcome of this event. I have cried so many times for this woman, I might not ever know. I cried for all the times I was being harmed and no one ever called it in. I cried because dispatch had said no one else had called it in. I sobbed like a baby in the laundry room so that the dryer noise would muffle my tears. I held my children and cried as they slept tonight. I prayed that they would never experience this hatred and evil. I cried because this man was so bold to take their altercation out in public which meant he was likely doing far worse behind closed doors. 

The police never called. They never requested the camera footage. You could hear the guy shouting so loud at her and hear her being shoved. You could hear and see him grabbing her arm... 

I talked to my fiancé about this but he's never lived through this type of abuse and I hope he never does. I don't think he knows just how much I wish I could have done more and maybe held my tongue and never gone outside. Maybe the police could have been a witness to the abuse or caught him mid act. I never would have forgiven myself if the woman was hurt while I did nothing but sit on the phone waiting for an officer. I didn't know where to get this off my chest but I needed to tell it. 

Thank you all for reading / listening. ❤️",https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/r3bfid/i_witnessed_domestic_violence_and_im_not_okay/,t2_9yg9ycro,1638011302.0
Nobody in my family is talking about this and I don't know what to do (TW mentions of Domestic Violence),"I'm keeping this vague for privacy of me and family

  
**TLDR**: A close family member of mine is divorcing their spouse after all these years b/c multiple people are saying they abused their spouse. My family is not saying about it and it's not making me feel confident about the allegations being false.  I don't want to cut off my whole family, but I don't feel comfortable around the blood relative anymore. Do I apologize to X and their kids about all that happened? Do I say nothing? Do I keep living as I do? Do I bring this up to my family and make everyone talk about it?

  
I (f24) had always been pretty close to my family up until I moved to a different state, afterwards it was almost like I had died to my family, and nobody seemed to want to talk to me, so I matched vibes and stopped trying. If they wanted to talk to me, they know how to reach me. (This is relevant to the story)  
So, imagine my surprise when I go on Facebook and see one of my family members talking about getting a restraining order and how relieved they feel about getting away from my blood relative (to make it easier the poster will be X and the blood relative will be Y). I do some digging on their profile and come to find out X and Y are divorcing. I find out through FB that they're divorcing b/c Y abused X terribly. I was in denial about it for so long and figured that someone on Y's side would message me about it. Nope. 

  
None of my relatives spoke about it until I was traveling to a family Thanksgiving with one of my other relatives and mentioned that X and Y were divorcing and--to my understanding--vaguely implied that I stand by Y through all of this. He never mentioned why they were divorcing either. I was in denial until about two weeks later one of X's kids started to post about their own experience with Y and all that they had witnessed. Y was also abusing them and their siblings. That's when it became real to me. And the fact that my family was just ignoring it didn't help me think that it wasn't true.  
Now I am conflicted about everything I know and remember. There were times when I was around X and Y and their family that didn't feel genuine or felt strange, but I shook it off as Y being drunk or being their usual inappropriate self (Y is known to make inappropriate jokes, conversations and all around 'silliness'). 

  
Not to mention that X and their children haven't unfriended me or unfollowed me on anything and that remains the same for some of my family members--both distant and closely related--I've already unfollowed Y on anything I could think of and whenever I'm near them at family events it makes my skin crawl. 

  
What I need advice on is, what do I do? Do I apologize to X and their kids about all that happened? Do I say nothing? Do I keep living as I do? Do I bring this up to my family and make everyone talk about it? (The last one might not be successful as they do not take me seriously, never have and probably never will since I am the one of smallest, quietest, grisliest, and 'have a temper'). I don't want to cut off my family entirely. Despite everything, I do love my little cousins and other family members whole heartedly and I want them in my life, but I am not sure about Y. I've already asked my mom who's been divorced from the family since I was 4, and she just said ""there's two sides to every story"" which is her way of saying make up your own mind. What do I do?

In an abusive domestic violence relationship,"Im in a 3 year relationship with my partner, who was loving and caring when we got together. She was nice to my son who has autism and was sensitive to his needs.we have had 2 lil girls in that time and her behaviour has changed. The way she speaks to my son and demands prefection from him is unfathomable. The way she prioritises chores over eating and feeding the kids is unbearable. I come home after working 10 hour shifts, picking the kids up from day care and school care and have to cook dinner because she didn't have time even tho she only works Friday and Saturday nights. And then complains when we have no money yet she has part time job she does not want to restart yet because aged care now compulsory to have the covid vaccine and she dont want it. (I've had my first shot). But blames me for the issues in the house and blames my son for her attitude. I realise leaving is the answer but I can't turn my back on my girls. That need their dad.

My son thanked me today.,"Sometimes My son’s (15yo) friends will come over, 1,2 some days even 7 of them will hang out here, playing video games in his room, or just chat and play guitar.

Sometimes I’ll order them pizza, other times I just cook bigger portions for dinner. 

I made sure they ask their parents permission if they want to stay late here and provide them with my number.

I heard from my son today that one of his friend’s parent is a single mother and his dad just got out of jail for domestic violence towards his mother. His mother is a good mother, but often falls on hard times, my son said his friend feels welcomed and safe here. So he thanked me.

I spent 3 hrs with her and got in contact with DV services in my area to see what they could do for her. She was against staying at a shelter but we thought her relative might take her in until she was able to be independent. But the whole time she kept repeating that she didn’t want to leave the relative in her home who was enabling her abuser. In the end I realized I couldn’t convince her that she shouldn’t go back to the place she gets abused. I let her go back. She has contact with DV services now, so I hope she asks for help when she needs it. I’m so sad.

Domestic violence witness,"A really big shout out to all the people in the domestic violence work field.

For the first time in my life I witnessed and made the call for a domestic violence case what just happened.
Im shaking in my boots and have the urge to cry for how cruel people can be. 

I wasn't helpful for the phone call , couldn't see the  perpetrator at all because it was dark and I had a blackout and couldn't remember what the street name was(I gave a vaque description of the streets surrounding it .)
What i did report was that it was on purpose .
He ran out of his car yelled at her and her friend, ran back to his car and then back to her yelling again and begins punching her till she went down.



For the workers,i deeply respect you for the strength it must take to witness this daily.

For the victims, I have no words to describe how sorry I am for you having to endure something like that( not just physical ,also the emotional victims)

For everyone else, please help someone who's in need for it.

It is never your fault! [TW: domestic violence],"Okay I just saw a comment on another subreddit that really really hurt me and I need to vent. 

The comment I saw talked about how (in the posters pov) in an abusive relationship both are responsible for the abuse. Like ... ""Well he/she won't hit her/him for no reason"" or ""well they could've left at anytime"" and that deeply disturbed me. As someone who has developed ptsd from an abusive relationship one of the hardest lessons for me to learn was/is that I am not at fault like my abuser would like me to believe. 

The mentioned comment got approved by many and one wrote that acknowledging your own part in this is the most difficult to learn in recovery... I guess they meant to say that recognizing how self sabotaging/ self harming behavior can lead you to stay or even be in such a relationship in the first place is the hardest part but ... I wouldn't say that can be stated as a general fact either. It just hurts so much to see that some are still blaming the victims of abuse. 

If anyone reading this had to go through this, let me tell you, it is not your fault. Never. And living with the trauma gets easier over time when you work on it. Recovering is worth it. Please don't let anyone tell you it's your fault that a person you trusted and loved treated you like that. Believing that just benefits the abusers. It can happen to anyone so please always try to be mindful. Shit like this can ruin you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/krpzwn/it_is_never_your_fault_tw_domestic_violence/,t2_3hwhxvmz,1609946831.0

My ex falsely accused me of child abuse and domestic violence to hide her affair.,"I am sorry about how long this post is. I tried to give all the relevant details including my mistakes as well.

I (41m) was married to my wife (39f) for over 14 years. 

We got married in the early 2000’s while we were in college. We both went to a Christian college and were from conservative backgrounds. 

In hindsight I realize now there were some major red flags in our relationship. For example she would refuse to talk about sex at all. What she liked, what she didn’t, she would not speak about it. She also did not allow me look at her naked or touch her chest area at all. If I did she would make a pervert accusation. She also would refuse to kiss me. 

Needless to say we did not have sex often at all. Usually only when she wanted to become pregnant. Later in our marriage (after our second kid) she would refuse sex entirely and just be content to dry humping. 

I was respectful of these wishes and never addressed the issues. I probably should have been honest and forced a conversation about it but I never wanted to push. 

I went to college for theology and eventually became ordained in a certain denomination (not easy to be ordained in this denomination). 

While we were living in a fairly big area, we were a part of a church plant. So I was volunteering most of my time as youth pastor while I was also working one sometimes two other jobs. 

I got tired of working so much and not seeing my family, so I started looking for a full time ministry position elsewhere. 

I found a job as a childrens pastor in a different state, in a fairly small area. One complication is this would move us away from both of our families. 

I had thought she was supportive of this move, but as I thought about it later, I noticed I missed obvious clues she was not. 

She is a teacher and got a job working from home. It was a good fairly lucrative position. 

In the new area, her demeanor changed. She started to get mean and spiteful in her comments and actions towards me. Occasionally it would even trickle down to our kids (two young daughters). 

More and more I started taking my daughters to work because she said she couldn’t handle them at home while she was trying to work. 

Her mental health got bad enough that her mother moved in with us for a few months. She said she was doing better then her mother moved out. 

It was at this time she all but refused any physical contact with me. There were a few aspects of my job that were stressful. At this time I started to struggle with pornography.

With her struggling she was  seeing the  senior pastor of our church (my boss) for counseling. 

It all came to ahead one day when we had an argument. She was yelling at me, and I did not want to argue so I looked at my phone. She went to grabbed it and I moved it away from her. She got extremely mad. 

I remember this because the next day she weirdly tried to get me to admit to grabbing her wrist that night. I didn’t notice it at the time but I think she might have been recording on her phone. I noticed it at an odd place on the table. 

At the time I was oblivious but Her insistence that I say that I grabbed her wrist made me feel weird.

From there the tension in our house became worse and worse. Every few days she would try to get me to say that I grabbed her wrist. It was really bizarre.

I noticed that things were not going well between us and wanted to make it better. I thought the best way to do this was to be upfront and honest about everything. 

I told her I was struggling with pornography and she flipped out. Truly flipped out. 

I also had gone to the senior pastor at the time and we made a plan and I got certain apps on my phone to guard against it. Meanwhile my ex told everyone she could about it. 

Most people were surprisingly supportive. My ex told me she was upset because people were too nice to me. 

Two weeks later she falsely accused me of child abuse and domestic violence. She went so far as to get a restraining order against me. All of the details were not true or exaggerations taken out of context. There was at least one person, leader in the church, who also lied in order for that to go through. 

That person was the wife of one of the other pastors on staff. 

In the course of week I was completely isolated. I was suspended and eventually fired. No job, no place to stay, no local friends, all family on her side -nothing. The girls were with her and I had supervised visits. 

To be clear there was absolutely no evidence of wrongdoing just what she said. They did several forensic interviews on My kids. It breaks my heart what they must’ve been through at this time. 

One thing that surprised me was the viscousness of her family. I would think her family who knew me for a long time would at the very least ask me about it or get my side of the story. Especially considering they’ve never seen any type of behavior like what I was being accused of. And her mother had lived with us not long before these accusations. 

They Were not interested to get my side of the story. I discovered that my father-in-law went around in the area we had previously lived And spread some pretty nasty rumors. He met with any of my old friends and even my parents to try and tell them how abusive I was.

More happened but it is not important. Very suddenly she offered to get a divorce and give me half the time with girls. I should have been suspicious but I just wanted to see my daughters. My lawyer was no help at the time so I agreed. 

Not long after I agreed, it became public that my ex was having an affair with the senior pastor. Also about the same time all the accusations were officially declared as unfounded. 

What hurt the most is all this time she refused to have sex with me yet was sleeping with an older gentleman. 

I discovered leadership in the church knew about the affair and did not tell me. Certain leadership in the church was not only hiding it but spreading untruths. Also that the district leadership of the denomination suspected but tried to sweep it under the rug. 

To this day it’s still amazes me how my life was completely derailed by just some comments and one person making things up.

Ironically the pastor ended up cheating on her less than two months after our divorce. She is also now married to the brother of the spouse that lied. 

I was able to get a new career although I have walked away from the church entirely. The amount of hypocrisy I saw during this process and the length they would go to to sweep things under the rug really amazed me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/wqpct9/my_ex_falsely_accused_me_of_child_abuse_and/,t2_euobaizq,1660743836.0

I am a domestic violence victim advocate,"And today I was dealing with a victim who is in shelter for her husband hitting her.

I am very against violence in intimate partner relationships. I abhor the idea of hitting or striking your partner. I think it is shameful and unforgivable.

But today, I dealt with this client who literally insulted and disrespected me. She called me a liar to my boss, who I respect immensely and dont lie to. She called me ""simple"" for defending myself -- I have a fucking masters degree. And she continued on and on about how I am horrible at my job.... just everything. Accused me of talking shit about her with other clients (which I dont do because I will get fired. And I like my job.)

And after leaving said boss' office continued wailing and gnashing her teeth. Crying alligator tears letting everyone in the house that I am just everything awful even though all I do is advocate and support people.

Because I wouldn't run her through a fucking drive through...

And never in my life have I just wanted to reach across the desk and strike someone, but goddammit I wanted to today.

And I realized and understood something -- I dont agree with her husband hitting her. I dont agree with any intimate partner violence. 

But I can understand why he did it after dealing with her. I can understand why someone who isnt a trained professional who deals with trauma responses on a daily basis would want to just punch her square in her mouth. Someone with less patience, tolerance, and conscience would just put her on the ground.

And I'm a bit ashamed of that. I am ashamed I raised my voice at a client. I'm ashamed I got angry and cried. 

But I'm not ashamed at sticking up for myself and establishing boundaries. Because the only people who dont like it when people set boundaries are the ones who took advantage when you had none.",https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/j81tzp/i_am_a_domestic_violence_victim_advocate/,t2_8eq1yohw,1602259808.0
Witnessed Domestic Violence and Should Have Done More,"Throwaway account and TW warning for domestic violence

Was walking my dog at the park and head some loud argument near the road. Overheard something about home wrecker so being nosy, I stayed on the path about 10 meters away and listened since it was getting louder.  

Suddenly, it gets serious, when the woman screams ""let me leave"". This has gone from interesting to serious, so I stay to make sure everything is okay. I didn't have my phone on me and I was thinking about flagging someone down nearby in case things get more serious.

As I watch, the argument gets more heated and the man keeps her from walking away. In fact he walks closer to her, and she keeps backing up. Suddenly he has his hands around her neck. 

This is where I regret not doing more. All I did was move in closer so that I was on the sidewalk too where they could see me. I was too afraid to call his out, but he quickly got his hands off her. Some more people started to gather around and he let her walk off. He got in his car and sped off too.

Domestic Violence happened in my parents’ house.,"Almost nightly, my mom gets drunk (blackout level) and often takes Ambien and/or Norcos also. My dad is a light sleeper, so when my mom and I talk, we get yelled at. Same for getting snacks or water. Mom is more of the problem than me because she’s sloppy and rude while drunk. 

I cussed my mom last night because she had done so to me before that. She was getting frustrated with her phone so she started arguing. Eventually my mom went to her bedroom and asked if dad drove off. Yes he did:

My dad was irate so he told me he was going to leave for a while to calm down. Then mom popped in and started arguing some more. He then got in her face, put his hands around her neck, pushed her up against a wall, and then moved his hands to repeatedly box her ears! Not super hard but enough to hurt. I told him not to do it and he stopped and told me that that’s why he needed to leave. 

Great. Now he’s gone and I have to put up with my mom’s alcohol breath by myself. She was crying and angry in her room while he was gone. I tried to comfort her by hugging and letting her know that what he did was wrong no matter what she did. She wanted to drive off herself too, but I managed to convince her to stay and eat dinner. Dad came back, clearly effected by what he had done. He ignored us; we ignored him. 

He’s talking about divorce and so is she. He’s hinting at suicide and so is she. I am trying my hardest to not intervene. It is harmful to me to get wrapped up emotionally in their dysfunction. I am their son. I am not their parent. I am not a counselor. It’s detrimental to my fragile mental health to mediate like I did when I was growing up. They’d argue, so I’d try to talk to both parents separately and try to lower tensions. I did this because on a couple of occasions, one of them would drive off for a half hour or so. I was so scared of abandonment. I still am, but I know it’s not my role to solve their problems with/for them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/kttrke/domestic_violence_happened_in_my_parents_house/,t2_9epfqm18,1610209182.0
My employer wrote me up for being a victim of domestic violence,"Near this time last year, I (28F) was at the tail-end of an extremely toxic and abusive relationship. In the last three months, (the time in which we had moved in together) the abuse had escalated from verbal and emotional to physical. I started a new job shortly before things came to an end with my ex and I.

It doesn't matter how I got there, but one day I realized I had to get out. Right then. There was no time for waiting. So I grabbed the only two things in the world that matter to me, my two cats, and left. I left in the middle of the night with nothing. I had my purse and my cats and my phone and that was it. Thank God, my parents lived 45 minutes away and welcomed me with open arms.

One of the first things I did, even while still recovering from the emotional shock and trauma of leaving a long-term physically violent relationship, was contact my boss at my new job to make her aware of the situation. I didn't have my scrubs, I didn't have any running shoes, I didn't even have spare underwear or socks. She was incredibly sympathetic to my situation and insisted that it was ""no worries"" and that my job would be waiting for me when I could safely get back.

I took two days off of work, during which time I was able to get some (not nearly all) of my stuff back from the apartment my ex and I had shared, and get it together enough to show up to work and be productive.

I worked a few days with nothing of note occurring. Then a couple days after my return, I got pulled into my supervisor's office. I was receiving an official written warning due to my 'excessive absences'. I was still in the 90-day probationary period, in which, technically, there is a zero-tolerance policy for absences. I was informed of this, and it was presented as if they were doing me a favor by only writing me up and not taking more severe punitive action. At the end of the meeting, my supervisor told me that she understood that these absences were due to a 'difficult situation' and gave me a pamphlet for a support group for survivors of domestic violence. It felt like such a slap in the face. No worries, indeed.

I still work for this company. I don't know that I can ever forgive them for treating me like such a number and not a real person, with real emotions, going through an incredibly hard time.

Further more, months later, when I was pulled into another meeting to reprimand me for leaving work early, which I explained was due to finding out about the death of my grandfather, my supervisor had the audacity to say ""Wow, really having not a great year, are you?""

I am so frustrated, and I know that large organizations have to have some sort of bureaucratic/administrative processes in place that are black and white and followed consistently. But it just felt so wrong to face punitive action due to a circumstance that I could not have helped.",https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/pj503h/my_employer_wrote_me_up_for_being_a_victim_of/,t2_9dvund60,1630952005.0
"If you learn/hear about someone’s abuse story and have no sympathy or make fun of it in any way, you are indeed a piece of shit.","Whether it’s sexual assault of any age, or domestic violence, PTSD, if you mock it or make fun of it then you’re a heartless asshole

Unless that person is also a complete asshole but even then it’s still not right in a way.

Edit: just want to say this post was a general thought towards anyone who has shared a story personally and it was turned on them or received a horrible reaction latent or immediate, or shit we see in the media i.e. Me Too movement. I see a lot of comments with kind of misplaced anger veering into completely different topics, which is a natural course of action for a message board and I understand your reactions, but the negative comments are reading WAY too far into it. 

Also to the person who sent me resources to basically a suicide hotline, I appreciate your concern but I didn’t write this post out of despair and pain…

I'm a man and a victim of domestic violence,"Hi reddit users,

As a 36 year old man and a victim of domestic violence, its slightly strange talking about it. I am going through a divorce against pure malevolence with a daughter on the line; I got PTSD and fibromyalgia due to all the shit Ive gone through. The hard part for me is that abuse extended to my daughter and cat as well. 

Unfortunately, this entire ordeal has alienated me from my family. I've been fully emotional neglected and now with covid19, not being able to see anyone face to face is a bummer and lonely. 

Currently, I am homeless trying to take out a loan to pay my lawyer and secure a condo. My work doesn't have short term disability so I had to go on E.I and now I cant get a loan without a cosigner and I dont have anyone to cosign. My disability benefits haven't kicked in. Does anyone have any suggestions for unconventional loan? Even if the option is going to the Mafia I am open to it. I live in Ontario. Any suggestions would be appreciated. At this point, I'm starting to think its impossible and I really do have shit luck.

 
Thanks",https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/irz6fa/im_a_man_and_a_victim_of_domestic_violence/,t2_82khlobc,1600007217.0
"I want to tell him the effect all of his abuse had on me. TW‼️⚠️-Domestic violence, Child abuse, R*pe.","I put a trigger warning and it’s heavy. I hope this is okay to put here…
I (f 29) haven’t seen my “father” since I was 8 or 9yrs old when we finally escaped his abuse. 
Everything he put me through during those years has left me with severe anxiety and PTSD. It’s affected relationships and how I see the world. I feel like after all he’s put me through he deserves to know the effect his actions have had on me. He contacted me back in 2015 and when I tried to get answers then he just told me that he blacked out and doesn’t remember any of it. I knew then he would never hold himself accountable or give me the answers I needed. I haven’t spoken too or heard from him since. This time I want my say and I don’t want answers I just want to inform him and get it off my chest finally. 
I’m nervous but I know it’s something I need to do. Am I wrong for needing this?

Here’s a bit of background about the kind of things I went through as a young child. I also want to add that it happened to my mum and my 3 younger brothers also but I can’t speak for them so I’ll just be speaking for myself and how what he did affected me. It’s also important to mention that my mum worked 2 or 3 jobs to keep a roof over our head and to feed us because he did nothing. She took us to work when she could and she also tried to escape him many times. I remember her wandering the streets with my siblings and I in the middle of the night trying to get away from him but he’s always find us and drag us back. The police even came once after she received a beating once and they asked her “what did you do to cause him to beat you up?”. Shed throw him out only for him to come straight back smashing windows and kicking doors in.I think unless you’re in that situation it’s hard to “just leave”. 
He was abusive not just physically but mentally. He used to wake me and my siblings up and make us watch him r*pe my mum. He would chase me into corners of rooms and wipe his armpit stink and sweat in my mouth. He cut above my eye open and just left me to bleed and when my mum got home she had to take me to get stitches. I still have a scar to this day. 
He loved to scream at us. Didn’t feed us when he was looking after us so I had to grow up pretty fast to help care for my brothers. 
If I did bad on a spelling test he’d hit me with this thick bit of wood across the hands. His belt was his favourite weapon besides from just straight up smacking or hitting us with his bare hands. 
All I remember is violence and what felt like torture. I remember seeing him beating or abusing my mum or beating or torturing the shit out of me and my brothers. 
After we finally got away I saw him once and it was the reason for my first ever panic attack. I was that scared I ran and hid them proceeded to be sick. 

Anyways, I know this has been long but Needed to get this out. Once I started typing it just kept going. Thankyou if you’ve read to the end.
Do you think I should tell him? Or am I torturing myself? I feel like m at a point in my life where it’s something I need to do for myself. I don’t want a reply I just want to tell him. 

I want to let him know that despite his torture I believe I’ve turned out to be a good and caring person and it’s no thanks to him. I won even though the memories are always there niggling in my mind and nightmares.",https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/zl69l7/i_want_to_tell_him_the_effect_all_of_his_abuse/,t2_eirpsxnb,1670963970.0
I am the reason why my husband might lose everything.,"Edit: I can't reply to everyone here but I know I shouldn't stay with him. I'm just really struggling because I hate seeing someone suffer. By law he has to attend 6 hours of anti-agression training now and his first appointment will be today. I am also in contact with the local domestic violence organization and if I decide I want the restraining order they will help me with it. 

3 days ago my husband lost his temper on me so badly that I had to call the police. He tried to strangle me multiple times, dragged me through the entire house and kicked, hit and spit on me. The police prohibited him to come near me for the next 2 weeks now and there's a case against him because I told them what happened. 

He is completely dependent on me. His visa is only valid because he is married to me. He doesn't have a job right now so I am his only source of money. He doesn't even have a place to stay in these 2 weeks. He is sleeping in a homeless shelter. He has back problems and it's cold where we live so he is probably in pain because he has to be outside all day. The criminal case against him will likely impact his stay and his future citizenship. I know it's wrong to feel that way but I feel horrible and very sorry for him. 

It wasn't the first time he hurt me physically but I never called the police for fear of what would happen to him. He has nothing to go back to in his country of origin. I feel so bad that he might lose everything because of me. He blames me for provoking him and maybe he's right. 

I want to separate from him, I'm so afraid of him and what he would do next time he gets angry. But if I do that he is going to lose everything and a part of me feels so guilty for that.",https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18coqx5/i_am_the_reason_why_my_husband_might_lose/,t2_43c7ci5hu,1701927867.0
A domestic violence incident I experience as a young child,"When I was a young child maybe three or four, my like 18 year old mother scooped me and my sister up and ran to the car. She was chased out by my dad, yelling and angry because that's just what he was. While backing out, he threw something at us, cracking the wind sheild. We loitered around for a while, then we went to her mom's house. Along the way, I (the only one who could talk) was coached to say that a rock flew up from a big truck and hit it. My grandma did ask what happened, my mom told the lie and then I told the truth. Awkward, and my grandma could abide no such trashiness. We left soon and my mom pulled over to the side of the road, she got out and broke a stick off from a tree and set to beating me with it. She called me stupid and that I should have listened, why did I make everything harder? When she was done she sobbed in the driver seat. I tried to be quiet and invisible, hurt physically and hating myself for making her mad at me. And then we went back home.",https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/jcpwde/a_domestic_violence_incident_i_experience_as_a/,t2_39d5xzzl,1602914195.0
I just admitted being a victim of domestic violence.,"First of all. I am a man, mid 30. I had a wife for 10 years and 2 years ago we divorced. 

When we first met and the couple of first years, it was okay. The good outweighed the bad in the relationship. But in the last years, she became more and more aggressive psychologically. It was always the way she wanted or she would become mad and start doing some psychological torments on me. If I had the nerve to reply or anything, she would try to destroy me and my confidence.

As an example, after we broke up, we would normally go to a restaurant on Saturday morning to the transfer of our daughter. (Shared custody 50/50). One time, I had something else during the day and told her I would bring our daughter but would not be able to stay for lunch. 

She became mad and told me ""Don't worry, I'll go with my new boyfriend, he is more of a father to our daughter than you are anyway"". That destroyed me. I'm still not over it. But anyone that know how much I take care of my daughter and love her would tell you that I am ""one of the best father they ever saw"" (their words not mine). 

Long story short. It hurt me bad. I never told anyone and tried to get over it for our daughter. I even tried to become friend again with her. Since a couple of months, things were going great. I had the same friend I had at the beginning of our relationship. It was great. Until this morning when I told her I would not be able to help her today. 

It was her weekend to have our daughter and she planned activities without asking me if it was okay or not for me. Assuming that I would always say yes (she trained me to respond that way). We had a fight. We had fights before this one but they did not bother me as much. This one, she used the same crap she used against me back in the day.

I felt on the ground. Had a panic attack. We were texting, she was already gone from my house with my daughter.

I texted my best friend. Told her I needed to talk with someone right now.

And I told her my situation. I told her everything. My friend is a social worker. She helped me through it this morning. But it felt good to finally tell the truth to someone. I will confront her eventually with that fact. 

She did suffer from domestic violence last year. So she knows how it feels. She was also really scared that she was an abuser with her new boyfriend. She probably was, but he did beat the crap out of her multiple times so she was outmatched in that area.",https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/gthxql/i_just_admitted_being_a_victim_of_domestic/,t2_46tpi69r,1590859520.0
I am choosing homelessness over further domestic violence and abuse,"I was conditioned from an early age to accept abuse, neglect, and violence as a consequence of my existence. Unfortunately, I have accepted these circumstances as an adult as well and as a result I have lived with violence for over 25 years.

You can imagine I am a very troubled person. I somehow put myself through college to become a social worker but all that is gone now. I gave up my career to take care of my abusers in their time of need and their exploitation has led to financial ruin and further crippling mental illness.

My partner of 5 years decided to become violent with me in November and injured my neck, but I protected her and did not report it. I was fired from my job because I had a mental breakdown outside of work and missed 2 shifts.

I have been seeking help but the free clinic can't do much for me. There are no resources for male victims of domestic violence in my area, and all homeless resources are way beyond capacity.

I've been homeless before, I have no fantasy of what that life will be like, but I can't do this anymore. I have never once fought back against any of my abusers, but on the street I will at least attempt to defend myself.

The emotional abuse has been constant this year and the violence and threats of violence are escalating. My partner is leaving today to visit family. I will not be here when she returns.

I'm heading south to hopefully avoid exposure this winter. I will have next to nothing. My physical health is not good. My chances of survival are low. I know I can't be here anymore, it's making me very sick with increasingly severe symptoms.

My aspiration for 2020 is to survive the winter, if I can manage that maybe then I can think about reclaiming my life.",https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/ei6kgz/i_am_choosing_homelessness_over_further_domestic/,t2_5cad9abi,1577816211.0
Question about domestic violence.,"Hello. I have been on these support subs the last four months or so, and they have been so very helpful, thank you to everyone on her, and reading this. I have a situation where I am not sure what advice to give. My younger sister is twenty one years old. She has BPD or something much like it, and can become very emotional, begin panicking about the potential of abandonment, and threatening suicide, to cut of all her hair etc. Her boyfriend and her have been together five years. He is twenty two. He had pretty bad anger issues, he has worked hard on these, but he still has a tendency to pathologize, her issues a quite real, but he will use it as a reason she is the cause of their issues, though they are usually unavoidable, or co-created. In any case, neither is perfect, but both have made active attempts to fix the issues in their relationship, though without guidance from anyone who has real, good, experience dealing well in relationships, or training. But they have been fighting a great deal lately.

They were homeless until a few months ago due to youth and poverty, and though they have a place now, and never had a hard drug or alcohol addiction in either case, the CPS anologue here in Canada, is dragging their feet on getting their two kids back, the youngest of which is three weeks old, from her/my mother. My mother does not seem to be in any hurry, and yesterday she kicked my sister out, despite children's aids idea that she was to live there several months, it has only been three weeks. Apparently she goes in and out to often, and despite the c-section three weeks ago, my sister does not clean enough.

She, and they, are distraught over the difficulty seeing their kids, and the lack of milestones or a timeline to get them back. They have some deeper issues she has expressed. He is still angry from a cheating incident several years ago, and when in a full blown argument, says shitty thing, ""I hate waking beside you, I hate the sound of your voice, etc"". She will grow very angry at him, they had a lot of co-created ideas about starting a business, she still wants to, but now since the birth of their second child, is regularly telling him to be a man, get a job, well stating explicitly she will not.

This morning she calls me in tears, asking for cab money to come over to my apartment to talk. So I do that, and she expresses that they got into a blowup argument, and he raised his fist to her. This is not normal, but it apparently is not abnormal in crisis, though he has never actually done anything to hit her. He has held her physically apparently, when she has become emotional, there is no excuse for any of this, but I should note she will not allow him to leave when they are fighting, and will follow him down the street.

She has expressed that he is angry at the withering of their sex life, but that though she is still attracted to him, the resentment prevents her from wanting him to touch her. I just do not know what to say to her at this point. I do not want to tell her to end a relationship I really feel can be salvaged, with the father of her children. But I do not want to encourage her to stay in a failing relationship, or act as an apologist for domestic violence. She mentions living alone, getting an apartment.

One part of me thinks this may help, a bit of distance may allow them to work on their stuff without it being too close. But her issues are such, that I do not feel she would be able to easily handle living alone. She never has, and her abandonment stuff, the intensity of her loneliness, I am thirty seven years old nearly, and though my like issues are better controlled and I am older than her, I found it very hard for months. As well, the practical monetary issues of living alone. She has finally seen that therapy is a good idea, but though I have agreed to pay for it, she won't move forward with the referral names I got her. I cannot hand hold on this, I can pay, but she has to make an appointment, and go to it herself. I am just at a bit of a loss. Anyway, any advice is a appreciated, and I thank anyone who read this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/8da10j/question_about_domestic_violence/,t2_9zkvzo3,1524092600.0

I heard a domestic abuse victim screaming in fear in ICU and it’s weighing heavy on my heart.,"My grandmother (95) is in the hospital again. She’s been in ICU for the past two days. Last night when I was visiting her I walked into the hallway and could hear the woman in the next room screaming in fear. I kept hearing the nurses say her name and say she was in a safe place yet she kept screaming. I then saw what must’ve been her daughters run into the room telling their mom she is safe and he is gone. The pain I saw those young women in was unreal. All I could think was how lucky I was to have an abundance of kind and loving men in my life. If you’re someone that is hurting others please stop. There are so many more victims than you know. My heart is broken for this family, I truly hope she gets away from him and leads a happier life.

Edit: I’m on my way back to visit my grandma right now. and I hope this poor woman is feeling better.

Anxiety attack meets domestic violence.,"In the middle of a massive anxiety attack tonight, curled up in bed with the bf shaking and crying and suddenly we hear screaming outside. We look and see some asshole guy is dragging this girl around by her hair and she's screaming ""get off of me"" over and over and she sounds fucking terrified. I called 911 and the cops say they'll send someone right over. We're sitting in the dark just watching and waiting for them to show up and then he grabs her hair, whips her around and throws her to the ground. My guy grabs his clothes and starts getting dressed. I follow. Neither of us wants to get involved and I'm terrified he's going to get hurt, but we can't sit and watch this girl get the crap kicked out of her, either. Thankfully when we got outside the cops were there and it's broken up. Don't know how ok the girl was but she was still on her feet, so that's something. 

Fucking piece of shit thinking he's got the right to toss this girl around just cuz he's bigger. I really hope he got more than a slap on the wrist. We stopped watching after that. I cried the whole way back inside and we climbed back in bed and he held me until I calmed down and stopped shaking. I was so fucking scared for that girl and so fucking scared that my guy was going to get hurt trying to keep that from happening. 

I guess I just needed to get this off my chest. Thanks for reading. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/7v4r3q/anxiety_attack_meets_domestic_violence/,t2_4caca8f,1517719823.0
"To the girl working in the store I just walked out of, I hope I did the right thing.","Your ex was looking for you outside, and accurately described you as a thin white chick with green eyes. I told him I had only seen an Asian chick and a larger mixed race girl with brown eyes. Obviously I don’t know your situation, but in my experience a guy looking for his ex at a store where he isn’t even certain she works doesn’t normally bode well.

Update: at the suggestion of a couple of commenters I did just drop the store a quick phone call to let them know. 

Domestic violence is a serious problem in my country, and probably the reason I was able to spot that this was potentially a dangerous situation for the young women being searched for is because in my job I deal with people, most often young mothers, from lower socio economic backgrounds; one of the largest demographics of domestic violence victims. Protecting people’s privacy is also one of my first responsibilities in my job.

I'm a domestic violence victim.,"I originally wrote this in /r/askreddit in response to the post What's the most f**ked up thing your SO(or ex-SO) has done to you?, and I apologize for the crosspost, but this was the first time I wrote down a list of everything that happened in my last relationship. My response is gonna get lost in all the other responses, and I just need someone to read this. It was such a catharsis for me that I just feel I need to get it out there somewhere.

My first real relationship was so completely f**ked up. He was bipolar and very abusive. Some of the things he did to me include:

1. When he was trying to date me and I wasn't interested yet, he told me he would ""make all my friends hate me"" if I wasn't ""nice to [him]"". Pretty much implying 'sleep with me or else'.

2. Pointed a gun at me when I was talking about another guy (who was coming on to me, but who I told I had a boyfriend). Later he said he was ""just a joke"" and when I threatened to press charges, he told all our mutual friends I was crazy and didn't know what I was talking about, after all the gun was empty so who cared, right? People started not talking to me after this instead of supporting me, so I went back to him.

3. Told me at my mother's funeral, ""I'm tired of being around your family, I just f**king want to go home.""

4. When I got lost in Disney World and didn't have a cell phone, I called him from several other people's phones (just random tourists who I asked to borrow their phone) and tried to get in touch with him. It was closing time, so I got pushed out of the park and had to go wait at a nearby hotel (Grand Floridian). I found some people to call him and he came to find me, but when he got there he grabbed my arm and called me an a**hole for getting lost in front of everyone who had been trying to ""reunited these two lovebirds"". I felt like an a**. This was the day after we were engaged too, ironically.

5. Left fingerprint bruises on my arm when he grabbed me once. His friends said they weren't big enough to be a concern, so why was I making such a fuss.

6. Continually compared me to his sister and said I would just have to come second place to her because she was his family. Even when we were engaged. He also said anything we bought together (house, ect) he would leave to her and her family in his will. Since he was older, I could see myself being homeless after he was gone and this bothered me a lot considering I was going to put my own money in too.

7. Punched walls when he was mad, road raged while mad, screamed and called me all manner of insult when mad. Blamed it all on me anyway.

8. Would constantly call me lazy. I woke up one day, made him breakfast, got him off to work, did the laundry, mopped the floors, cleaned out the fridge, did the dishes, grocery shopped, mowed the lawn, sold some of the stuff he wanted to get rid of on craigslist, dusted the whole house, made him dinner, ect. When he came home, he screamed that the laundry was never put in the dryer. Another time after doing all that work and eating dinner I had cooked with him, he went to bed and I said I would clean up the meal. I cleaned up everything but a bowl of corn (half a can at that point, probably 50 cents or less). I went to bed. Got woken up the next day by him hauling me out of bed by my arm, poking me with the bowl of corn and asking, ""WHAT IS THIS?! WHAT IS THIS!!! YOU CAN'T F**KING DO ANYTHING CAN YOU??"" I was too tired at that point to even know what was going on or what he was poking me with, but his hand on my arm hurt.

9. After he threw me out of his house once, I went to go sleep at my friend's house. He called her up screaming at her, telling her she should have ""left me out on the f**king street corner."" She told him that this wasn't what friends did and she would do the same for him. He never wanted to speak to her again because how DARE she help me.

10. Told me pointblank one time, ""I haven't loved you in a year when are you going to get the f**king point?"" and told me I was pathetic. Considering we had only gotten engaged a few months prior, it really f**ked with my head.

11. One day, he was pissed off and getting in that mood, so I decided to go hide in the basement. His tenant told him where I was because she was ""staying out of it"" (she was pretty crazy too and wanted to have sex with him as soon as I was out of the picture). So he comes downstairs, ranting and raving and backs me up into a corner. I know he's gonna hit me and I have nowhere to run. But then he grabs a screwdriver from the workbench and I back myself into a corner, absolutely terrified. Then he turns toward the wooden door and proceeds to stab the screwdriver into the wall over and over and over and over, as I huddle in the corner, figuring he's gonna turn on me next and watching my life flash before my eyes. He just kept screaming ""You f**king b***h! You f**king b***h! You f**king b***h! You f**king b***h!"" Eventually, after a few minutes of this, he drops the screwdriver on the floor and just walks upstairs, still pissed off while I try to remember to breath again. Later, I'm still not talking to him, trying to stay out of his way and all he had to say was, 'God, I didn't even touch you. Get over it.'

12. One time, when we were broken up (we broke up pretty regularly), I had been living with some friends who were allergic to my cat, so I couldn't bring her with me. My fiance told me he would take care of my cat. Later, he breaks up with me and says he's keeping my cat (my family was all dead and my cat was all I had left of them, so this absolutely broke me in two). Despite all calling, emailing, even driving back to where he lived several hours away to knock on his door, he refuses to give me my cat back. Eventually, he brings me to court because I'm ""harassing and stalking"" him. I had to go to trial, and come back the following month for trial again. The judge threw the case out of court as soon as he could. I got my cat back finally.

13. When I was in the hospital for a tumor (which was possible caused by the black mold I helped him clean out of his garage), he promised me he would get help for his bipolar. I told him I would pay for the doctor and if they said he was fine, then I would never ask him to go back again. I'm a social worker, so I was pretty much right on the money there. I sent him an online screening test from a reputable source before he went to the doctor. It came up as HIGHLY LIKELY to have bipolar and should see a doctor. He then screamed at me that I was trying to change him, I never loved him, and he only promised me that because I was in the hospital. Then he blamed me for the fact that he had to sit in the hospital while I was there on their uncomfortable cot bed because how dare I get sick. I was just a waste of his time.

14. When we were in a long distance relationship, trying to make it work, I was living with some friends. My friends were leaving our apartment and I had to leave because it was in their name. Me and my fiance talked about me moving in with him. He was supposed to come and get me the week before my friend's apartment lease was up, but at the last minute he changed his mind, said he didn't want me living with him anymore. When I tried to explain to him that I didn't really have a Plan B and he was pretty much making me homeless, he screamed and ranted at me about how that wasn't his fault and how dare I try to place it on him, when he was the one who backed out at the last minute.

There were other things, but that's some of the gist.

He's with another girl right now. You wanna know the F**KED UP part? I feel like I'm the f**k up that he always told me I am because I miss him and wonder if I could have done things differently. Gaslighting will do that to you. I also wonder how things are going with his new girl and if he'll be the monster he was with me with her and if not, why is she special and I'm not. 

Like, what's wrong with me?",https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3m9zd4/im_a_domestic_violence_victim/,t2_8axw9,1443144435.0
I'm sick of the way male victims of domestic violence are treated.,"I honestly feel as if I can't take it anymore. I was in a violent and abusive relationship, and it literally almost killed me. My girlfriend was physically and mentally abusive, and I once had to get stitches from when she stabbed me in the shoulder with her keys. Missed an artery by half an inch. Of course she wasn't arrested, I told the police and they just ""gave her a talk."" She had another violent fit when I came home from the hospital for talking.

Such is the nature of male victims of domestic violence here in Australia. We have virtually no legal or social recognition for male victims. Even if I try and google something for male victims, the only results for men and domestic violence are pages for abusive men to stop their behavior.  I am not an abuser. I am a victim. 

I hate how society has this screwed up idea that men can't be victims. I hate how feminism has somehow become the moral spokesperson for the domestic violence movement and use this position to make things even harder for male victims. I hate how what happened to me is funny.",https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3x3m8q/im_sick_of_the_way_male_victims_of_domestic/,t2_t01qv,1450286158.0
My life is a mess since fleeing domestic violence almost 2 years ago. It feels like I'm being punished for my ex's choices.,"In 2017 I met a man I thought was great. Slowly, everything turned bad and I found myself in an abusive relationship. It took 4 times for me to finally leave for good. His family protected him despite him being arrested several times for domestic battery and stalking. He also took advantage of the fact that I'm disabled to further abuse me. 

He isolated me from my friends and family and eventually I had no support system left. I ended up having to move in with him. My mental health took such a hit that I ended up in a psych ward in 2020. I made the decision to stay away from him for good. Because I'm disabled and still don't get a check, the only person I knew was my ex's mom's friend. At first, he was nice but it quickly became apparent that that wasn't a safe environment either. 

He was controlling and yelled at me constantly. He blamed me for my ex's abuse and soon, being with him made me feel like I may as well have never left my ex. I couldn't leave the house without making up an excuse for why I needed to leave even if I was running errands and the entire time I was out, he would blow up my phone wanting to know when I was coming back. He tried to touch me inappropriately several times despite me telling him that I was not interested in every time I said this to him, he would threaten to throw me in the street.

What made things even worse was that this was early 2020 when the lockdowns happened. I'm in Florida and the governor issued a shelter-in-place order. Every single place for housing halted there application process and froze the waiting list. It's finally starting to open back up and I have applied to different places and I'm waiting to hear back.

Things finally came to a head about three weeks ago when he tried to take my phone and break it and tried to grab me physically. I left his apartment and have not been back since. It's just not safe there. I have been living on the street ever since. An old friend from high school was letting me sleep in his car but I found out last week that he left the state so that is no longer an option. I have used up all of my grace nights at local shelters. They give you so many nights a month and then you're on your own. 

I have used up all of them for the month that one shelter and that's pretty much the only overnight shelter here now. I called Salvation Army here and they don't do overnight shelter anymore. The only long-term women's shelter is a long application process. I have already turned in my documents in order to apply but there is a long waiting list. Same thing with HUD housing, they told me that the wait list is six months long.

 I have been sleeping in an abandoned house I found. I just feel like I am suffering for my ex's choices, I'm walking the streets being disabled and meanwhile he's sitting at home just fine. I just don't know what to do anymore, to be honest I've been having thoughts of suicide. What sort of life is this? I'm about ready to just give up and take my own life. I don't really see the point in living anymore. I called The Domestic Violence Shelter when I first left and they were full. It's been the same way for the last 2 years. 

Every time I call I get the same answer, we're at capacity. The domestic violence shelters in the surrounding counties do not consider my situation dire enough because it's not like I just left. Even if they would take me, it wouldn't do me any good because I would be stuck out in the middle of nowhere with no way to get anywhere. 

There is no bus system in the surrounding counties. The only place that was willing to talk to me about housing has an appointment that's 3 weeks away. I'm not really sure what to do anymore. I haven't had a shower in almost a week. I'm just really at my wits end here.",https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/sb81kx/my_life_is_a_mess_since_fleeing_domestic_violence/,t2_iycunxyf,1642982949.0
I DID IT. I GOT OUT.,"TW: mentions of domestic violence, mentions of addiction


I've survived mental and physical abuse, I've lived in a mixed gender crisis shelter full of addicts and domestic victims for 7+ months, I've dealt with it and pushed through, got offered an internship in the municipality here, stayed in school through IT ALL, just signed a 2 year lease on a place JUST FOR ME and I couldn't be happier.

"TW⚠️ Domestic violence, R*pe, child abuse. ⚠️I want to tell him what his abuse has done to me and remind him what he put my mum and siblings through…","I put a trigger warning and it’s heavy. I hope this is okay to put here…
I (f 29) haven’t seen my “father” since I was 8 or 9yrs old when we finally escaped his abuse. 
Everything he put me through during those years has left me with severe anxiety and PTSD. It’s affected relationships and how I see the world. I feel like after all he’s put me through he deserves to know the effect his actions have had on me. He contacted me back in 2015 and when I tried to get answers then he just told me that he blacked out and doesn’t remember any of it. I knew then he would never hold himself accountable or give me the answers I needed. I haven’t spoken too or heard from him since. This time I want my say and I don’t want answers I just want to inform him and get it off my chest finally. 
I’m nervous but I know it’s something I need to do. Am I wrong for needing this?

Here’s a bit of background about the kind of things I went through as a young child. I also want to add that it happened to my mum and my 3 younger brothers also but I can’t speak for them so I’ll just be speaking for myself and how what he did affected me. It’s also important to mention that my mum worked 2 or 3 jobs to keep a roof over our head and to feed us because he did nothing. She took us to work when she could and she also tried to escape him many times. I remember her wandering the streets with my siblings and I in the middle of the night trying to get away from him but he’s always find us and drag us back. The police even came once after she received a beating once and they asked her “what did you do to cause him to beat you up?”. Shed throw him out only for him to come straight back smashing windows and kicking doors in.I think unless you’re in that situation it’s hard to “just leave”. 
He was abusive not just physically but mentally. He used to wake me and my siblings up and make us watch him r*pe my mum. He would chase me into corners of rooms and wipe his armpit stink and sweat in my mouth. He cut above my eye open and just left me to bleed and when my mum got home she had to take me to get stitches. I still have a scar to this day. 
He loved to scream at us. Didn’t feed us when he was looking after us so I had to grow up pretty fast to help care for my brothers. 
If I did bad on a spelling test he’d hit me with this thick bit of wood across the hands. His belt was his favourite weapon besides from just straight up smacking or hitting us with his bare hands. 
All I remember is violence and what felt like torture. I remember seeing him beating or abusing my mum or beating or torturing the shit out of me and my brothers. 
After we finally got away I saw him once and it was the reason for my first ever panic attack. I was that scared I ran and hid them proceeded to be sick. 

Anyways, I know this has been long but Needed to get this out. Once I started typing it just kept going. Thankyou if you’ve read to the end.
Do you think I should tell him? Or am I torturing myself? I feel like m at a point in my life where it’s something I need to do for myself. I don’t want a reply I just want to tell him.",https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/zl6em2/tw_domestic_violence_rpe_child_abuse_i_want_to/,t2_eirpsxnb,1670964296.0
I got dragged into the middle of a domestic violence situation last night,"My dad has been dating someone for 6 months and moved in with her at around 3 months. I never trusted her. I always felt bad vibes around her, even when she was acting like a normal human being (and in fact, she was the subject of my last reddit post).

I really wanted to be wrong about her but last night I was instead proven right.

She, my dad and my nephew went out to dinner. Apparently on the way there she was already hitting my dad in the car on the way there because she had a bottle of wine before they left.

Then she had 2 or 3 Long Island ice teas at dinner and started shit with a table full of dudes next to them. She almost got my dad into  a fight with them, so he left there, taking my nephew with him.

He blows up my phone around 9:30. I wasn't planning on going out anywhere last night because my car is having issues and I don't feel comfortable driving it at night, but I said I'd come over to his old house which he doesn't really stay at since he moved in with her.

We go straight to the restaurant and she is gone but her car is still there, so we're stopping at different bars along the way to find out where the f she is. I tell him we need to first go back to her house and get his cats and my nephew's shit and whatever is most important while she is not there and take it all back to his house and deal with her after (if at all).

As we're getting shit, she comes home (her daughter had picked her up) and she is belligerent. Screaming, punching, kicking, throwing shit and putting holes in walls. Her daughter is trying to hold her and I'm trying to get my dad out of there with his stuff and the cats and she's screaming and throwing shit at me to get the f out. She punched my dad in the face a couple of times when she got away from her daughter and I was outside throwing his stuff in the car. 

I go back in and they're in the kitchen and she's grabbing pills from the cupboard and throwing handfuls down her mouth. My dad is trying to get them out of her mouth but I didn't realize what is happening so I am trying to pull him away from her until I see she's trying to kill herself.

I tell her daughter to call 911, and she does and my dad is still trying to get her to throw up the pills. At one point I am locked out of the house and they are in there alone (the daughter had gone next door).

I go next door and tell them I am locked out and where is the ambulance???

I get back and the door is now unlocked and he's still holding her on the floor while we wait for the EMTs. 6 cops and 2 EMTs finally show up and want to talk to all of us and get her under control inside.

My dad is telling them what happened but he doesn't want to press charges against her because she will lose her job. Her daughter somehow authorized them to hold her on suicide watch for the night but she was still throwing elbows and screaming and it took all of the responders to get control of her.

My dad said he was done with her and I went over this morning to help him get the rest of his stuff, but apparently she is being released today and she is blowing up his phone and my nephew's (I have no doubt she'd be blowing up mine as well if she had my number).

My dad feels horrible about everything and I think his resolve to cut ties with her completely is waning. She says she doesn't remember what happened last night but she needs him. Doesn't take any responsibility at all for her actions.

I told him she needs help that he can't give her and she won't be forced to seek if he keeps enabling this BS. Apparently they have had scenes like this before in 6 months (news to me!) but never quite this bad.

She is an alcoholic with some mental health issues that she needs to address, and if he goes back, she will never address them because she will have gotten what she wanted.

I don't know if she'd kill herself but him going back isn't going to make everything OK. It will only reinforce her idea that she can manipulate him.

I didn't have a lot of respect for her before this, but last night destroyed any shred of what may have been there. If he goes back, I cannot spend time with him around her, and his grandson (my nephew) said the same thing.

I am exhausted and my nerves are shot and I've needed to take a Xanax just to calm down and sleep. I never want to go through that again. I don't want this dysfunction in my life.

Nobody won last night. We all lost.",https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/exu91k/i_got_dragged_into_the_middle_of_a_domestic/,t2_cumec,1580673971.0
I'm a domestic violence survivor,"And I have PTSD, and depression. I can never relax for one day. On the outside, nobody would know my seemingly never ending pain, because I always put on this badass facade. I feel silly and robbed of my dignity to even have to be labeled a domestic violence victim/survivor. Its painfully embarrassing, and painful. But I am terrified of my life every day. I never go into full honest detail about it with anybody in my life. Im always making it seem like my life is a breeze, and have to constantly lie about why I am always changing my number, social media accounts, addresses, etc. I am terrified that he may find us and try to push for contact with my child through the courts just to get in contact with me and keep tabs on me, and wreak havoc on my child's life as well as mine. Im scared he might retaliate because I left him and relocated. I lost all my old friends and can't make new friends because I have deep trust issues, and don't want anybody to know anything about my life, because I'm scared they might be fake and turn around to make a mockery out of me and my experiences, blame me, and even try to harm me. During my relationship with my abuser, he would always get to know every new friend I would make and sleep with them or use them as his personal messengers to keep tabs on me. Words cannot describe the pain of this level if betrayal. I wish I could trust one person in a position of power to help me, but I already know that getting the courts involved will be useless and do more harm, as I have experienced in the past. I feel pushed to live my life in complete denial of all this craziness just to maintain some sense of sanity, when all I want to do is break down and cry all the time, or lash out in rage.

Age 20: Domestic Violence

Age 22-24: Dating a narcissist. This phase included sexual assault, non-consensual touching and rape by coercion - all of which was gaslit and normalized.


Besides this there are other cases of catcalling, slut-shaming, etc. Also, I was raised by at least one narcissist parent. The other might not be a narcissist but they are so toxically codependent, both of them have been pretty shit. They actually believe that they are fine and what they have is ""love"". Lmfao. 

I have been raised in a society where this is so normalized that leaving the country made me realize that I was in a dystopian trance for so long. I'd much rather die than move back there.

I am starting to believe domestic abuse or violence against men is close to 90%,"I am a counselor in training and most men that I have encountered have experienced some sort of mental/verbal or physical abuse from their wives, girlfriends, parents or loved ones. Many men talk about how their wives or girlfriends smack them or say something to trigger them into a depression.

 I had one guy who injured his back during a roofing incident and he talked about how he felt that his wife started to lose respect for him by going out and staying out late. He suspected her of cheating on him and when I challenged him he told me that he feels this way because she does not let him know where she is going. When previously she would tell him.

 I have also heard stories of men being hit by their girlfriend when the girlfriend is drunk. I will also include parental abuse as well for, people kind of skip over how abusive mothers can be to their sons physically and mentally. We hear a lot of father/daughter dynamic but the mother/ son dynamic when talking about abuse usually get brought up when talking about serial killers, or some other extreme cases. 

I appreciate you guys listening to my rant. I just had to get this off my chest. I feel like people treat or see men as this monolith group and think that we have no fear, or worries in the world when that is not true. This is not a comparison post, but if you think it is then  you might want to reevaluate how you may think about topics that focus on men. 

I just want to say to all the men that experience abuse by the hands of their partners, parents or loved one that you are not forgotten and to not be ashamed to find help.",https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/x1dtwx/i_am_starting_to_believe_domestic_abuse_or/,t2_9i38w,1661849121.0
How I ended up being abused by my now ex- TW for domestic violence,"Throwaway  because my mom knows my account. I was born in 1995 to a very young  married couple. My infancy was good; I was held a lot by my parents and  my mom stayed home all day with me. Both of my parents have said I was a  very happy and giggly baby and a joy to be around. This was all going  to change, however.

When I was a  year old, we got evicted from our apartment and moved in with my  grandparents. My parents’ marriage crumbled and my dad had to move out.  He looked at me sleeping in my crib that day, knowing he had to leave,  expecting to never see me again. Through my childhood I was told my dad  didn’t want to raise me anymore and it was also implied to be due to me  being diagnosed with Autism.

I was  diagnosed with Autism and put through ABA inspired therapies in order  to function as normally as possible. My grandmother especially pushed me  to make eye contact and let people hug me, no matter how I felt. I  couldn’t appear to be a rude child to anyone she knew, so I let people  do it.

When I was in after school  daycare, I was told by the workers that I had to share my toys with  other children. It went as far as the workers allowing other children to  take stuff from me/not punishing them if they did.

By  the time I got to my teen years, my grandmother was still washing me in  the bath when I stayed over. I had been pushing her to let me bathe on  my own since I hit puberty but she refused to allow it. She thought that  due to my Autism, I was incapable of bathing. She used the same  rationale to justify dressing me and helping me into bathing suits long  after I was capable.

I got  involved with two internet predators, both of whom consumed my life.  Both of them would require me to keep in constant contact, preventing me  from developing a social life.

I  dated a man whose mother was especially abusive towards me. She would  yell at me, threaten me, and treat me like a small child. Her son rarely  ever defended me against her and often said I deserved it.

My  next partner was no better. We were long distance and he was sexually  aggressive very early on, demanding that I send him sexual pictures.  This eventually became videos, which had to happen weekly minimum. He  used sex as a punishment for any and all infractions. If I said the  wrong thing, took too long coming home, or didn’t tell him about a  purchase I made, he would punish me by forcing me to get naked over  Skype. I would be forced to finger myself or do whatever he told. I had  to inflict pain on myself for his own pleasure.

I  visited him last year and his attitude towards me changed. A couple  days into the visit, he got angry with me for fidgeting too much in my  sleep. He spent the morning yelling at me and then apologized. He took  me out for coffee to try to “repair our bond”

A  few days later, I went to bed at around 2 in the morning. He was still  awake so he continued to watch TV for another few minutes. He eventually  came to bed and started touching me while I was trying to sleep. He  felt me up under my clothes and tried to have sex with me, despite me  trying to sleep. I asked him to please stop and told him I wanted to  sleep. He said no and continued to touch me, also starting to remove my  clothes. I started to cry and pleaded with him to stop. He got angry  with me and told me to go into the bathroom. I got up and sat on the  floor in his bathroom for probably 20 minutes until he grabbed me and  pushed me to his bed.

Once he got  me to the bed, he said he was going to give me something to cry about.  He pushed me down and pulled my bottoms off. He forced himself inside me  and thrusted as hard as he could. I asked him to please stop but he  continued even harder. He continued for around 15 to 20 minutes as I  cried, frozen. He suddenly stopped and apologized. I stayed unable to  move until I coaxed myself into pulling my pants up. He said he would  never do it again and I just lay there, still frozen. I did not sleep  well that night.

On another  occasion, we got into an argument. After yelling at me and telling me I  was nothing but an arrogant brat, he placed his hands on my neck. He  pressed down and choked me for a minute. Not long enough for me to lose  consciousness, but long enough to let me know who was in charge. I knew  then he could kill me if he wanted to.

I  am pleased to say I am doing better now. My rapist and I have split up  and I am now with a lovely man. He knows about all of my trauma and  never uses it against me. Now, when I cry, instead of being told I’m  stupid or spoiled, I get cuddles and love. My boyfriend allows and  encourages me to go for walks, to have friends, etc. He’s been there  through the hard times and the easy times. I am slowly learning to trust  him and feel loved.",https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/gwqxe0/how_i_ended_up_being_abused_by_my_now_ex_tw_for/,t2_6nybsd77,1591306893.0

He's a classic domestic violence victim and she's a crazy violent drunk.

He keeps letting her back in.

She's in jail, too. Felony assault.

I do what I can but I can't save him. I don't know what's going to happen tomorrow.

Praying he doesn't catch charges when she has a record of being the aggressor.

I've never been exposed to domestic violence like this.

It's a mess and I wish I could fix it for him. He's my best friend. Hate to see his life in ruins.

Seriously if someone hurts you, don't let it get out of hand. He stands to lose everything.

The nurse in the hospital asked me about domestic violence and I broke down in tears.,"I (39F) was admitted to hospital in the early hours of NYE and while the nurse was doing my obs, she had to ask me the difficult question about suffering any domestic abuse. I broke down in tears, and after confirming my husband (41M) as my NOK, she have me a very concerned look. 
What I had to explain to her was in fact that my husband has never laid a finger on me, but was the person that saved me from my abuser.
He has seen me through the worst part of my life and laid down everything to save me.
He has been my absolute rock, and without him and our 3 kids, I would have had no purpose. He's not perfect, neither am I, but we're perfect for each other.
I can't tell him this, because what I went through angers him greatly, but I need to express how deeply thankful I am for everything he has done. The last 9 years with him have been the happiest of my life. I really hope he knows this. 
To everyone in the wilds of reddit, battling abuse in one form or another, there is hope. There is someone out there willing to make a difference. I know, cos I found mine.

Being a male victim of domestic violence and the feeling of loneliness,"Hi, I’m a victim of domestic violence both psychological and physical. I won’t talk about what happened in this post but it’s probably somewhere in my profile. 

I’m Brazilian, and with all that’s happening with Neymar and all that the topic is being brought up more than usually for me at least.

First of all I want to make it clear that if he is in fact guilty I hope he rots in jail.

Now that that is out of the way

Holy shit man, it’s like everyone would be against you, you can’t even open up.

I can’t talk about it with my male friends without being judged and seen like weak and less of a man, tbh it’s a pretty sensitive topic for me and probably one of the only situations where I might even cry

I can’t open up and talk about it with my family without them thinking I’m gonna get really anxious again and everything is gonna comeback, all that fear and all that suffering would make my mom get really sad again

And I can’t even think about talking about it with my female friends, they posted the video where the girl hits Neymar, that’s all there is in the video and her saying that the night before he hit her and left her alone. She is literally hitting him in the video and of the girls in the group I consider a big friend is defending the girl saying Neymar is guilty until proven innocent (again, it the accusation is true he can rot) 

That gave me a lot of anxiety, I have 6 witnesses of when I got physically attacked and I did not even touch the girl, but I wonder if it would be enough for them to believe me. I’m wondering if I maybe should talk about this with that specific girl friend tomorrow.

"Half the domestic violence victims are men. I had a self proclaimed feminist claim that "" It's not a thing"". Well fuck you!","She spent a lot of time claiming feminism is for equality and then went on negating my own experiences. I told her it's not the definition but how people actually embody it that defines a term. 
Then when I brought up the disparity in DV with half thr victims of DV being men , she claimed it's not a thing. I backed up my claim of half the DV victims being men with actual scholarly articles that provide evidence and she says she wouldn't respond because I am just looking for an argument. 

I don't mind that someone has a different view from mine as long as they don't call me names or resort to personal attacks when we debate. But this shit right here pissed me right off. I am livid.

Domestic violence - need some advice,"I am so tired. I need advice. I am desperate to leave home. My family lives in a nice part of town so everybody thinks that I have a great life. My Dad gets violent a lot but when the police have come to Dad's house (I live with my Mum as well as my sister). However he says it's his house and I am very lucky to have a roof over my head). When the police have come, they just side with him. Sorry I always laugh at the his house part and it just makes him so mad. I don't mean to though. I don't think anyone should own anything, we should all care and share. Of course, you pay for something and it is 'yours' but I think we can share more.

My Mum just lies for him which I will never understand. It upsets me so much. I am autistic (high functioning). One cop told me I was a liar because I gave too much detail and real victims express emotion. I went to the hospital for one of the times he injured me (because I couldn't see properly). My Dad found out because a nurse told him two days later, it made him so mad. The nurse didn't believe me. I felt sorry for that nurse, she was one of those that really hates her job. She just didn't smile :-( And was so grumpy! I can't tell people's faces much but she didn't smile. But it also looked like she had a lot of botox so maybe that is why. He is well known in the Church and local community so I can't get help there. Everywhere I go, no one will help and they just call me a liar.

I am at university, however, it is more than two hours from where I live. I am too tired to travel this year. In past I have travelled, but have been able to get most of my classes online. We can download lectures and most tutorials are not compulsory. However, this year all my classes are not offered in online mode. I find university tutorials the equivalent to plucking my eyebrows; incredibly tedious and to the point of painful. It’s something I just rather avoid (don’t worry my face is not a plant, I get them waxed – much quicker (I wish tutorials were quick as that). I try and look like I am listening to my tutors (when I go) and let the students who always talk in the tutorials answer the questions.

It’s ironic that some of them have the audacity to call me stupid, yet they are the same students that just talk a lot but don’t make a lot of sense. I refer to those students as bagpipes; they are just blowing a lot of air (talking) and making a lot of noise. Of course I don’t say that to them. I rather them play the bagpipes in the tutorials than myself. No offence to anyone that plays the bagpipes. I think I will get some earplugs for the tutes. I really hate too much noise as it panics my head. Dad goes crazy a lot and gets really demanding, it is really stressful. My sister can be just as bad. I get bullied a lot. For those of you thinking, I wonder why you get bullied? I don’t talk to anyone at university. And no I don’t blurt comments out as what society would deem as socially inappropriate. Yes, there are times, I say things I shouldn’t, but I don’t mean to cause tears to a person’s heart. It is impossible at university because I am mute. I am too tired to try and understand their body language, it is though they are speaking another language. I am tired of the hurtful comments and just because they hurt me, doesn’t mean I should hurt them back. I have so much on my mind, I just want to be invisible. And the hardest part about university is, books keep me safe, but I feel safer at home because I understand it better than all the social politics that university presents. But in the long term, university is my way out. I would find it much too hard to be mute all the time though (in life).

Right now, I am too tired to navigate a whole new world, where I will need to adapt and evolve to the cruelness and unsafeness; there are enough bagpipes at home. But I know them and know the songs they play (home). I know the bagpipes at university wouldn’t hit me but I am not so bothered by that. In fact that would be easier as bruises can be covered. But the bagpipes at university are just like plucking your eyebrows, it is tedious and painful and the sounds hurts my heart for a long time. Dad is like that too and really good at it. Music can be soothing but this isn’t. It also leave scars that can’t be seen but the pain is just as bad. I hate bruises etc but people think pain only exists if they can see it. I don’t want people to see my pain but I don’t want my heart to be in pain either.

Sometimes, I think, I am so glad I can hide all this pain from you and you can’t see me hurting. However, I am tired now that is hurting so much. I will never understand tattoos. It seems like a self-inflicted pain. I don’t know why people want to put bruises all over their body. I am so sorry. I feel like a yo-yo at the moment.

University takes my mind off the sad stuff but sometimes it is really hard to concentrate. I don’t want to do university online because I am too far through the course and it wouldn’t be practical. It is summer break at the moment. I am trying so hard to get through this both emotionally and finding a means to do so. I never want to come back home (I haven't left)! But if I make the effort to leave, there is no turning back. But I am scared of the girls at university. Sometimes they scare me more than my Dad. I rather they just hit me that hurt my heart. But that would be a lot of tattoos. But I don’t have to pay for mine. Ugggggh they spread such awful rumours, that aren’t true.

I have applied for external scholarships and been rejected from each one so far. That is okay because so many people are in the same situation as myself. I haven't heard yet from my university regarding those scholarships but I am not holding much hope. I didn't disclose my home circumstances in the applications as I have no one to support what I am saying. Also, it could place me in a precarious situation if my Dad were to find out. But I noted I am a rural student, my medical conditions in addition to my academic record on the application. I was hoping that would strengthen my applications. Unfortunately, my medical conditions are severe in nature which make it hard to leave. My Dad holds that against me, it is hard to explain. I hate scholarships applications. How can you truly determine someone’s struggle? So if I get one that means another student misses out and is left in a situation with lots of tattoos. I feel sick even thinking about it.

I am just getting so tired from the situation so I can't think about university now. But I know I have to because I will have regret later. I do want to leave home because I am so tired of it but it may seem crazy to others who aren't in this situation. It is a bit like eating, sleeping and having a shower; it everyone’s daily routine. I don't like the situation but I am just used to it (oh but I would freak out if I couldn't shower!). I haven't been eating that much because I am so stressed and my sleep is so messed up. My Dad calls me fat but I am not – I am 56kg. I am actually skinny. Whatever, he eats lots of fruit cake, which is really unhealthy and I don’t. I think that is what you call a hypocrite. Sorry, I shouldn’t speak about my Dad like that. But weight shouldn’t matter, society is very sad like that. My uncle is big, which is cool because he can give me big strong hugs. Oh, but I only like them from people I trust.

Sorry it is all a bit hard to explain. The girls at university call me a retard, dumbtistic (they mean autistic and dumb together) and that I am stupid. I ask for your patience. They say other stuff but the university may be able to identify me (as it is quiet specific but it hurts a lot) and possibly my sister, which would be not cool. I know that sounds stupid but I can’t put my safety at risk. I am sorry for being so slow with this so I am going to try really hard with this. Maybe there is something that happens in your life every day? Do you exactly like it? If you asked the person next to you, they may call you a liar as it may just seem so unreal to them. Others just may feel uncomfortable or left wondering as to how you get through it all. But after a while, it is like tying your shoelaces or riding a bike. You don't think about it, you just do it. If you could have your life without your situation, would you change it? Or as uncomfortable as it, if the situation weren’t apart of your life anymore (it could be anything) how would your life really be? Would you cope? As you so used to it that life would be strange without it?

Sometimes experiences strengthen us, they take us to another place, we meet new people and we appreciate life for what it really should be. Would I changed my past? Do I wish for things to have been different? I only know my life and really can’t compare. Some people, may ride a Malvern Star and some may ride a Giant. The best advice I was given by a junior doctor, was that she told me to stop me to comparing myself to others. And no she wasn’t aware of my home situation, just my chronic D. It was bad then but I am doing much better now. I always felt like a failure I guess. I feel like there is a constant pressure in society to achieve and I will never understand the injustices of this world. So I can’t tell you which bike I would ride because I like most people have only ridden one.

However, when you get a chance to try the other bike because you have seen others ride it, you’re left wondering. However, it is easier said than done.Okay, so home is the Malvern Star and leaving is the Giant. We all have something going on, I am sure you have thought many times on getting on the Giant but it isn’t always practical. And lots of people like me, ride a Malvern Star, and man it can be a tough ride. It may seem crazy to you but I do get so worn out and think it may just be much easier to ride the Malvern than switch to the Giant. Is the Giant just a fantasy? Does it exist? I do think of the freedom of the Giant but it also scares me. And there are also other Giants (other bikes at university) that will happily puncture my tyres. I am not sure if I can face that. Sometimes, I think I would be safer on my Malvern Star. However, many would say I am being complacent and making excuses to not get off the Malvern. I guess, I can take a bike pump with me………and I guess if it gets too much I can come back to my Malvern. I don’t want that though. I want to be like the riders in the Tour de France – not really (most of them took drugs and it is a race and it comes to an end). I don’t use drugs but if you do, that’s cool. Sorry if I offended.

I want to get on the Giant and keep riding and see beautiful things and no longer having a sad heart. I need a heart though, otherwise I will die. So the heart without the sadness. It would unrealistic to have no sadness though. At the moment, the sadness in my heart is like when your pour so much topping on your ice-cream, it just isn’t eatable. The ice-cream melts and it is all one big mess. Eventually you have to throw it out. My sister would probably eat it though. I don’t think I could. I am too fussy like that. My heart is too much like the ice-cream lately. We should always be nice to be people, just because they don’t seem sad on the outside, doesn’t mean they aren’t sad on the inside.

Sometimes, you may fall off your bike and you really don't want to get back on, but this time I have fallen really hard and I think I could do with some help. Everyone has a tough ride in life, I realise that. I am not asking for a sympathetic ride or am I not parking my bike here to tell you about all my sadness. I don’t really ride bikes much at all, it is just analogy  I am so lazy and don’t exercise. If I had to ride a bike, it would be in the easiest gear. Some advice would be great because I am finding life really confusing now and I would like to ride the right path. I don't think there are right and wrongs in life either, however I would appreciate some direction to ride a less bumpy path.

Everything is a little dark right now and the light battery on my bike is running really low. My tyres are flat so if someone could help pump some wisdom into them, that would be great. And to all those people who have made my heart so sad by just rolling their eyes and telling me to leave, I have been trying to do that for a long time. But instead of giving me a gentle push, you have punctured my tyres. Why can't my bike stay and my Dad's be made to go? It feels pretty shit :-( Why don't people start saying that? However, university does motivate to wake up each day. But I don’t think a lot of people will be letting me park my bike there for class each day. I need a place in the bike rack to get me on a better track in life. Does everyone need to go to university? No, that is pretentious thinking, but for my own journey, I need it to help me with my dreams and it also gives me a purpose to live. Sometimes. It also destroys my soul. Oh boy, I get so distracted, sorry.

Every time, I have tried to ever leave my Dad goes mental but I don't know why because he always says he hates me. Is that a male thing? I am a girl and find other girls bi@tchy and confusing as anything. My youngest sister lives at home and gets very violent. She has BPD and is very mean to me. My two eldest sisters live out of home and don't care. My Dad buys them lots of things and they tell me to just shut up. The city where my university is, is so expensive to live in but I have got to the point where I will live in a tent. At least I will be able to see the stars  I love the stars. I just need someone's advice on how to get out safely.

I don't want people to be mad with my Dad because I do love him and he isn't a bad person. No one is bad, he just gets really mad. I don’t like that though, it is such a wasted energy. His football team didn’t play well last year, maybe that was it? But they haven’t always played that poorly. I just wish I knew what I am doing wrong, so I could stop him being that way? And why just mainly me? I must be doing something wrong? He answers the phone after being so angry and is really nice to the person on the phone. And no, he doesn't have a mental illness or anything like that. I know plenty people with a mental illness and they wouldn't hurt people.

I don't really care about $ anymore and scholarships, I just want to leave safely so anyone that has been in a similar situation, I would appreciate your advice. And yes, I feel very guilty at times because I went to private schools and was given opportunities that most people would not have been afforded. My Dad constantly reminds that I am lucky to not be homeless so I feel really guilty about people that have no-where to go. I have a place to sleep at night and a lot of people don’t, so that makes me really sad. They can sleep in my room when I leave but I don’t think my parents would like that. They could come here now and sleep on the floor but my room is messy and my Dad is grumpy. And it’s like my youngest sister always has that time of the month all the time.

The policeman last time, told my Dad if I called them again he could get me assessed at the hospital. Dad says if I leave the house without his permission then he will the tell police I have tried/threatened to k… myself. The times I have sneaked out, he always finds me! I guess it’s not that hard because I can't drive but still it is so annoying. Sometimes I want peace. If I don't answer my phone he gets pissed. I suffer from the black dog (D) also but it is much better (plus the medical conditions). He also tells me if I leave home he will k... Mum and himself so I am worried about leaving. I think I am going so crazy. I don't want the police involved because I don't want to be locked up in a mental home.

I have no friends anymore. And to be honest, I am not so bothered by that. Most people’s conversations consist of how drunk they got on the weekend, who slept with who and things I consider trivial so I am not really up for those conversations. Selfish, I know. I rather just read. Dad has made them go away anyway. They think, because I live in a nice home, then my situation can’t happen. It makes me sad they didn’t believe me but I don’t have to listen to their conversations anymore so to be honest for once in his life he probably has truly has helped me. Thanks Dad.

People don’t understand that a true friendship works both ways. But if they ever come to me for help in the future, I will always help them. I don’t need friends in the sense that somebody needs to be holding my hand, buzzing my phone and messaging my facebook every minute. However, I know the loneliness that exists when you ask for help and you get turned away.

I don't know what to do. And I think this is the place to post? Because I think I may have posted in the wrong place before. I am new here so please be patient with me. I added some more information to where I posted before, I hope that is okay. The last post was brief but it didn’t feel right as I hate the lack of detail. But I have tried to keep it brief. It was much too brief before. I was also tired so I feel this is better. I apologise for the poor grammar as I am tired but I can't sleep.

Also, if you think it best to stay and wait it out a while, I would appreciate any tips. What are things I can do to calm the situation? What can I do to be a better person and help my Dad? And no I will never trust the police again, so I will never call them. My Mum lies, my sister lies, so I rather just be in heaven than be put in that situation ever again (the police). My Dad tells me it’s all in my imagination and it makes me sad. My Mum yells at me and tells me I am evil. How do I be less evil? I should probably clean my room.

I AM NOT sui.....l okay. I would never ever rely on them for help when my Dad goes like that. The above was not a su……..l thought but sometimes I do not articulate myself well and I would never want to cause alarm.

Thanks so much. I am not allowed to say a lot at home without it being wrong. Every time I speak, I get yelled out and it’s the wrong thing. It is getting worse each day in that sense. It has been peaceful writing here.

Sorry for writing so much, sorry if I have said something wrong and sorry for asking so many questions and changing my life plans every second. I am all over the place at the moment. xxxxx

I got disowned and shunned from my family and community for sending my son in jail,"I am from Indian/Bengali background. We live in abroad. I have a son who got married a year ago. That day when I called the police, I saw his wife had bruises, black eye, busted lip. It doesn't take a genius to know what happened to her. I asked her and my son whose head was low in guilt. I asked him. ""Son, did you do this?"" He replied he did. He beat her because she served him cold coffee when he wanted it hot. My  daughter-in-law told me she did bring him hot coffee but it got cold while he was talking on the phone. My son said sorry and to never to it again. It wasn't enough. I called the cops on him. He got angry and attacked one of the officers. He is in jail.

This news got spread in my community like wild fire and people have been calling me a bad moms. Some told me I am ruining my son's future for something so small. My son will suffer in future because of these allegations. Some told me this is his private matter even as a mother-in-law I shouldn't have interfered. Some told me I should support my son regardless of what he did. After all son's are the star in a mother's eyes. I got a lot of backlash for supporting my daughter-in-law. I have been called names by everyone. They think I am making a big issue out of a small argument. Indian people see domestic violence as taboo. So they do not want to talk about it in the open.

My husband told me what I did was wrong. People will shun our family. That's what happened. None of friends talk to me. Even family members kicked me out of the group chat. My family member thinks I should have just given him a warning instead of calling the police. They all think my daughter-in-law must have done something bad for my son to react this way. My own parents think a warning to my son would have been enough. But that is not true. My daughter-in-law said he has been beating her since after 3 months into their marriage. Do I feel guilt for doing it? No. I do not. I do feel sorry I didn't caught this earlier. I do feel like I have failed as a mother because if I did a good job my son would respect women. I just wanted to share this. Because no one from my family or community will ever talk to me if my son goes to prison. Nobody is with me except for my daughter is with me. I know this will be a gossip for a long time. And people will not come forward to help me or my daughter-in-law. I will forever be the back ship.

Edit: Thank you everyone. I didn't know I will get these kind of support from you people. I only opened an alt account because I was feeling lonely. Nobody wants to talk to me. This has been a good place to vent. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/14bptqr/i_got_disowned_and_shunned_from_my_family_and/,t2_dkx8rd74b,1687004629.0
TW: domestic violence I was triggered tonight and I didn't know how close I was to death until now.,"So, I've never posted in this section.
A lot of shit happened about 5 years ago. It still feels like it was just a year ago.

It didn't start in Germany, it's not even when it ended. I was pregnant though and it still plays in my head like it was yesterday, but only when I'm triggered.

We weren't on good terms, I was maybe hoping it would get better before it got worse than it already was. We decided we would go out, get the kids a sitter. We went to the bar with karaoke just up the street from our housing. 

I can't listen to ""Simple Man"" because that was his song of choice. We stayed a while, but it was getting late. The sitter was wondering when we were getting back. He got mad. He still wanted to go outside the gates.

I can't really remember everything. He wanted to go to the corner bar? All I know is that I said, hey we gotta get the kids. He was really mad. I remember he broke his debit card in retaliation. Our only means of money, but at the same time, good. He can't go anywhere then.

There's a fog, but I had to lock him out. Did I ask the sitter to watch the kids overnight?? I don't even remember. I had to let him in at some point, but that was a mistake.

I remember him calling me a ""stupid"" slur name. I remember hearing ""Not this time."" The other times it was a choke hold. I can't stand trains anymore. When I would black out, it was like I was on a dark slow train. This time, he had his hands around my neck. 

I remember looking up at the ceiling light. It was like a drawing. Like someone drew a perfect world. Then it was like the train. I knew I was gone, but I didn't know where I went.

I woke up. I don't know how long it was, but he was punching me in the face. I somehow told him to stop and he tried to usher me into the kitchen, but I ran towards the door and went to my friend's house.

I was watching a show where someone was suffocated. Other times, I would be like, that's not realistic. He could wake up, but I finally looked it up. Maybe the show isn't accurate, but I woke up on time.

I would love to say that the relationship ended there. It was supposed to, but it didn't. It ended in 2017. I broke the cycle. I got out. 

He was an undiagnosed ptsd/bipolar. I feel bad for him even after what he did. He's still trying to get better. He also takes care of his kids when they're there. 
I still feel it though and I hate him for it.


I just had to get it off my chest.",https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/izywpg/tw_domestic_violence_i_was_triggered_tonight_and/,t2_mawyg,1601093034.0
Reddit and views on domestic violence,"I had a tough emotional day today. I'm a domestic violence attorney at a legal services organization and I heard that a client I had been working with was admitted to the ICU and unlikely to survive from an abuse incident involving her husband. She also miscarried her baby from him punching her in the stomach. I always expected in this field I might get a call one day that my client was dead but this was too much. She was so close to getting out. 

Everything was filed and ready to go with strict protective orders in place, but when he was served he found her and beat her to a bloody pulp. She had taken all the precautions and moved but her friend from church suggested she come stay with her. She promised she would be safe as we moved forward with the legal case, but her friend lied you see. She believed the husband was a good Christian man and like the rest of her church as well he would never harm a fly. So she told him where my client was. And he came while the friend was at work and took out his rage and now my client is going to die. How could this person who had locked her up so many times, caused her 5 miscarriages, starved her, and broken almost every bone in her body deceive allllll of these people? He didn't let her go to school work or have anything. I had to take a moment to hide in a conference room today and shed a few tears. 

I came to reddit to browse and post to offmychest but an article caught my eye on the front page about the Supreme Court domestic violence case involving guns. To be honest I haven't been following it closely other than a memo that passed my desk, but the comments blew my mind. Everyone was talking about the women who falsely accuse and the individuals who go to jail for just verbal arguments and then on to so many shameful comments about domestic violence victims completely minimizing their experiences and brushing them under the rug. They continued into flat out name calling and abhorrent comments and I finally broke down and cried. 

Over hundreds of cases I have seen represented personally, assisted on, observed, or just heard of I would say in my honest opinion only a handful of clients were exaggerating to promote their self interests, and probably only 2 or 3 were making everything up. But I truly believe the other hundreds were really being abused and there was more than enough evidence to back it up. And I'm talking photos of stab wounds, gun shots, medical exam records, eye witnesses, broken bones, threatening death in letters, emails, texts, etc. etc.

But why does it have to be so extreme? Doesn't the victim whose abuser threatened to kill her once deserve protection? Doesn't the victim whose abuser stalks her following her to work every day deserve her peace of mind? Doesn't the victim whose abuser got angry and hit her just once deserve support? Doesn't the victim whose abuser emotionally belittles her and locks her in her room deserve to get out? 

Thats hundreds of victims that I believe and that's just from my own experiences as one single attorney in one part of one state. I got involved in domestic violence work because I felt like there just aren't enough people to help these victims. I don't have anything to gain from putting these abusers away or taking away their rights. I'm not paid per case. I take my small salary and I work my face off to get clients help because I turkey believe in this, in what I do. In fact I want abusers to get help, I want them to grow to be productive members of society, and good husbands, and brothers, and fathers. No one benefits from locking all of these people away and throwing away the key. I just want these victims to get out. Get some justice. Get an opportunity to tell their story. Reading those reddit comments broke my heart into a million pieces. It sends all the hard work done for domestic violence back to the drawing board. 

There is still so much judgment, misinformation, and hatred towards victims I take it a little personally. So much! Maybe it's time I get out soon. I think I might suffer some burn out soon. I'm sorry if any of this is incoherent. So many things weighing on me today. 

My heart hurts and my client is going to die and her abuser will claim some great excuses and her ""friends"" from church are going to help him cover it up. I'm just going to cry it off because this keeps happening in this small ass place where everyone wants to believe domestic violence doesn't happen and even if it does these god fearing good Christians were just having a bad day and deserve redemption. Will her death be on their conscience when they are judged? But it's not just happening here, reddit just proved how much it's really and truly happening everywhere. Sigh.

Are there any good domestic violence/housing assistance left at all? It really feels like all social services don't exist at times and that I've been made to struggle alone. It's terrifying,"Crosspost. 

I don't like describing myself as an abuse victim - and haven't in a long time - because it makes people treat me with kid gloves, but I've had such a bad year I guess I could use a reprieve. I'm crying writing this.

First of all, the area I live with has *no resources* for housing. *Nothing*. I've had people swear to me up and down there were tons of social services available, but everything has no funds or has long waiting lists. No matter where I go, I can't get financial assistance for rent.

I'm short on rent and slated for eviction, and the only advice I was given was to... let myself be evicted. And *then, apparently, only then* get services - i.e, live in a shelter - and hope whatever social worker/counselor I'm assigned gets me ""connected to resources from there"". This was the advice given to me by a social worker I was connected too. They do not prevent homelessness.

It's so backwards and borderline barbaric.

I obviously don't want to do that - I obviously don't want to be in a shelter, waiting for services I may not even get because I'm so thoroughly traumatized by public resources failing to help me in the past I'd rather die then be forced to depend on people that will likely let me down again and leave me with nothing.

The job training I tried attaining didn't lead to anything. The job placement I was promised by past counselors never came. Being notified that I have to go to a shelter and be assigned a social worker from there makes me cry because I have a social worker and she and other counselors haven't helped me with anything.

God, the food bank! The only accessible food bank gives me expired food. I don't want to sound ungrateful. I understand beggars cannot be choosers. but it's so hard being being hungry, getting a bag from the bank (you only get one a month) and coming home to having to pick out moldy fruits from fresh ones and having stale bread and having those portions last less then a week because it's past it's sell by date and spoils quickly. Once that's gone, you have to live on a starvation diet of the canned food they give - and it makes eating so unpleasant and unfulfilling it's almost better to just go without at times.

The counseling here is lacking. I had a therapist, but there was only so much she could do. There was a humiliating instance of me calling a sexual violence counseling group in tears with the counselor on the other end reassuring me she could get me to join the group therapy sessions so I could have physical support with people going through similar things, just for her to very sheepishly call me back and state that since I didn't live in the zip code, I couldn't come after all.

(No, I can't do ""online support groups"" anymore. It's not sustainable for me. I've been without in person socialization for too long. It makes the disassociation, disconnect, and loneliness even worse and makes me feel like an avatar.)

How am I supposed to get assistance when all of the snide advice I get from social workers and counselors is essentially ""reach out to friends and community (that I do not have because of severe isolation from abuse) and ask them for money and rides""? I don't have anyone at all, and even community resources aren't there.

God, I'm so lonely! I have to endure this all alone with no support from anyone and it's so humiliating being badgered (by social workers who should know better!) as to why I can't ""just couchsurf with someone you know, leave your things with someone you trust"" ""just borrow money from a coworker or something"" ""go ask the family you don't have for help (seriously?)"" when I have no one that loves me or checks in on me. It's why I've been so vulnerable to being taken advantage of in the past and now I can't dig myself out of this pit because I've been left with nothing and no one to help me get out.

I just want to throw the towel. I'm so sad and exhausted.",https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/vf64ic/are_there_any_good_domestic_violencehousing/,t2_lky8dfne,1655558468.0
My neighbor beating his gf triggered my PTSD,"Im pretty sure I heard my neighbor beating his gf. I could hear him yelling and her screaming “stop” and “get off me”. I called the police but I felt really guilty about it because I don’t want be seen as a “Karen”. 

My fiancé said “well we don’t know for sure if he was hitting her”.  He made me feel even more like shit. I fucking hate him right now.

My neighbors fighting triggered my PTSD. My mother was a victim of domestic violence, and I watched her getting the shit beat out of her when I was only five years old. There was one occasion where my mother was screaming for help and her boyfriend placed a gun to her head and threatened to blow her brains out if we called the police. 

I wish I was like everyone else and I could just mind my own business, But I couldn’t live with myself if he killed her or put her in a hospital. I know it’s not my job to save everyone but shit like this bothers me.

I hate being a woman,"Sometimes being a woman makes life feel not worth living, like a cruel joke. Sometimes I hate being a woman. I hate that we bear all the biological burden with periods, painful sex and childbirth. I hate that biology has made it easy for males to orgasm during sex and a requirement for reproduction but not a woman’s orgasm. I hate that women aren’t as strong or big and it makes hurting us that much easier. 

I hate that on top of all this simply existing, it’s been weaponized against us in so many ways. I mean think about it, if genitalia was switched and males were born with vaginas and females born with penises, the entire sexual climate would be different now. Innuendos, slang, birth control, abortion, SA. We are seen as incubators and sex toys because of our anatomy. I had to get this off my chest because it gnaws at me sometimes, this feeling of being trapped in my gender, not as in “I don’t identify with it” but more like this heart shattering “If there is a God they didn’t care about women when they made us and there’s nothing I can do to make it better”. FGM, femicide, SA, domestic violence, honor killings, human trafficking, child marriage, etc. I think on how many women in history and around the world were made to feel like they were less than or their body wasn’t theirs and my heart breaks. If anyone has any actual good parts about being a woman that would be great because this just made me so sad lol.",https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/xan780/i_hate_being_a_woman/,t2_aepdjxzr,1662809810.0
I gave the cops the wrong address for a domestic violence report,"Today I had to call the police on another unit in my complex. I don't know them. They don't know me. It's a couple and their roommate and sometimes I see the wife play with their young child in the yard. They have a dog.

Today when I left my house she was screaming. I've never heard a scream like that before, it made my blood run cold and made me freeze in fear. She stopped only to hysterically shout ""get away from me"" and ""get off of me"" and once to cry for help. A man was yelling but I couldn't make him out over her hysterical cries and the dog barking. I ran out into the yard and called 911 and then locked myself in my car and cried. I had to walk past their unit to get to mine and I was too scared.

No one shows up before I have to leave for work, but dispatch calls me to confirm that dress. Our complex is weird and the assess doesn't always line up with where the building is so I don't think much of it. I go to work and stay very late.

Our building is long and split into quadrants of units. This family has a wreath on their door that obscures their unit number. When I walked by tonight, I happened to see that it wasn't the number I have dispatch. For example, if I said it was 4 it was really 8. The cops checked in the wrong family in the next quadrant over.

I'm horrified. I just wanted to make that she got whatever help she needed and I fucked it all up because I was too scared to get close enough to the unit to double check the number. I was certain I was right, I've lived here for years. I was wrong and I feel like I've failed this woman. People dot make noises like she did if they're just arguing. Something bad was happening.

The non emergency line is closed for the night and I don't know if it will be open tomorrow. Their office hours don't list Sunday's. I don't feel like I can call 911 to amend my report because nothing is happening right now. I just hope that they're open tomorrow and can do a wellness check or something.

Neighbor, I am so sorry. I hope that your child wasn't home to witness whatever happened, and I hope you are both okay. I am so sorry for robbing you of help.

My gf slapped me first.,"So long story short kinda…my girlfriend(38F) and me(24M) recently got into a domestic violence situation. It all started when I told her to eat because when you’re really depressed about something, which she was, you tend to forget about eating. She’s dealing with her sister dying. She then proceeds to compare death trauma, saying that the deaths I’ve seen and dealt with in life don’t compare to her sisters death. Mind you I’ve been nothing but helpful and supporting her emotionally up until now, even helping her move all of her stuff out of her old apartment and into storage a day before this so then she can prepare to see her sister for awhile in another state. Back to the argument, once she said my death traumas don’t compare to hers and that my grandpas death in Thailand doesn’t mean shit, I made a mistake by saying her death trauma doesn’t mean shit. Then, she proceeded to forward slap me twice. Then pimp slap me once and then almost push me down the stairs, to which I slapped her once. Now she’s threatening that she’s gonna call people she knows to “kill or jump me.” I think she’s full of shit but I don’t want to get stuck in a legal battle.

I’m glad my Grandpa left my mother only $1 in his will and gave the rest to his grandchildren.,"Back in 2004, he told me he was going to do it. He said he changed his will and was going to leave my Grandma [his ex wife] $2 and his kids [my uncle & mother] $1 each while he left the rest to me and my sisters. 12 year old me thought “yeah right, okay I’ll believe it when I see it”. 

Well what do ya know, he passed away in 2014 and during the reading of his will, jaws were dropping, tears were flowing, shock was setting in. My mother called me because I was living out of state at the time and broke the news. At first, I couldn’t believe it but I remember what he told me ten years before that. You son of a gun. I felt bad for my uncle but my mother, people a kick out of that every time I tell the story, here’s why. 

Here’s a little back story about my mother. She’s crazy, refuses to get help and made our entire family’s life a living hell my entire childhood. We were subject to physical and emotional abuse, alcoholism, homelessness, going evenings without meals, living in poverty, domestic violence, leaving me and my sisters home alone for hours while she worked. She never got caught for anything she did to us. I moved out as soon as I graduated and moved out of state. The tipping point for her finally came when she was arrested for third degree child abuse, lost custody of her kids, lost her job at a school, got a felony. 

I have no remorse for this woman. I do not talk to her anymore because it’s a toxic relationship and I will not subject myself, my husband or my children to that. I’m glad she only got $1. That’s all she deserves. Thank you Grandpa for helping us get out of debt and a new vehicle. I love you and miss you always.

Not seeing my son is killing me,"I have about 3 months without seeing, talking or hearing my son. And boy you think you’ll just adapt but this is a void in the soul and yet it’s feels so heavy. 

The mother of my son and I have been going back and forth legally ever since she took me to domestic violence court, with hopes she will get more money out of me. That put me under so much stress that my life was slowly degrading and getting ruined. She would always threaten me and make my life difficult by making me scared she will do more harm next to me, I got paranoid she would attempt physical arm against me. and eventually I lost my job because she reached out to my old bosses. 

At this point, I’ve lost everything, my son, my dignity, my job. The only things I really cared about, perfectly targeted and destroyed by my ex. So I decided to cut communication with her entirely, which includes my son, and focus on getting back on my feet. I really can not perform under this stress. 

Now, Many nights I stay restless, thinking I’m making a big mistake, worried I’m becoming a dead beat father. I took good care of my son and was a very involved father, I put him in the best school I could afford, gave him a great quality of life, I would drop him off and pick him up from school everyday. I truly enjoyed watching my son walking towards me when I picked him up from school, asking him how he day was, asking him what he learnt and hearing about his friends. Now all gone and I feel a sense of guilt.

Every moment of joy or happiness that I feel doesn’t last long, my joys are quickly stolen away by the guilt I feel. I tell myself how can I be happy when I have a child that is probably wondering where his father is.

But the truth is. I can’t rebuild my life with my ex in it. She will tear me down before I get a chance. I even got a call from my lawyer this week, that she even summoned me to domestic violence court again, after not even being in the same country for months. And I can’t do nothing about it, I can’t even pay the lawyer anymore. All I can do is sit and let her do her damage and hope I can come back from it.

I ask my self everyday how could she do this. A week before I got served we were having positive conversation about being supportive parents for our dear son, then a week later like I’m served letters from a domestic violence court. I’m honestly so lost, confused, angry. She accused me of everything that she did to me. My character was assassinated. Yet her and her husband calls themselves “Christian” and uses God to justify everything that they’ve done to me. 

I really wish there was another side, I ask myself that maybe I did something to cause this. But the truth is, all I’ve done is took care of her, financially, and she used it to build a lavish lifestyle, and when I found out she was getting married, she saw that money was not coming in anymore (why would I take care of another man’s wife). She tried to use the domestic violence court  to get a judge to force me to continue to provide for her lavish lifestyle. But in the end, what she and her husband didn’t realized, that destroying me, also destroys them, hurts my son and everyone that I take care of. Their greed was so powerful that they couldn’t see that they were cutting the very branch that they were depending on. Honestly, I would Say that my only fault in this is being stupid and giving her too much money (thousands a dollars per month). I ask myself how did she convince me to give her so much money regularly and I can’t really say. Manipulation is a hell of a tatic. 

I just wish I can flip a switch, build something, make money and get my son out of there. It’s killing me how slow this is and slow it will be. I really pray that I can rekindle our relationship and the bond that had. 

This is a point in my life where I’m not sure what will happen. But I have Faith and rise to the challenge. I’ve gotten closer with my Faith and it’s been pulling me forward. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ao4u5u/not_seeing_my_son_is_killing_me/,t2_79ihj174,1707646484.0
My Dad is upset it's taking me an extra year to finish my graduate degree after I was a victim of domestic violence & sexual assault. I'm trying so hard.,"I am a grad student and also a victim of domestic violence. I had to go on leave from school due to the physical & mental toll & to get away from my abusive ex. He didn't beat me. When he would get upset he would destroy my things, his things, or the house we were renting (& jointly liable for). He would scream bloody murder in the middle of the night, punch things, break furniture into pieces, throw things, sometimes at me, sometimes I got hit. A couple times he hit me directly. He would corner me frequently and criticize me. Threaten me. He told me everything he did was my fault. For awhile I thought if I was better it would stop. He threw furniture at my door when I tried to ignore him. I lived in a twisted world where I walked on egg shells, hid in my room to stay safe, & rarely ever left. I listened for his door so I knew when he was in his room & I could run to the bathroom or grab food & sneak back. If I I heard him come out I would hide. When it would get really bad I'd grab my dogs, sneak out in the middle of the night, and just drive or sit in the parking lot. I also snuck them into school when I was scared he would hurt them if I left them there. I did call the police. But I was so scared of his threats & his lies, I never told them everything that was happening and they never did anything with what I did say. Eventually, I told a professor a small portion because I wanted him to understand why my work was suffering. He was amazing, & he helped me go on leave. More importantly, he believed me & told me that it mattered. That my safety & sanity **mattered**. I owe him so much. 

I've been through a lot since then. I felt pressure from my parents & my own shame to get over it quickly & move on so I returned to school before I should have. I tried. I tried to pretend I was fine. It's over, so I should be fine right? But I wasnt. I had severe anxiety, panic attacks, flashbacks, & nightmares. I would freeze when a guy raised his voice or got aggressive in any way. I was sexually assaulted. This time I didnt ask for help. I didn't call the police because nothing happened to the first guy who hurt me for months, why would this be different? Also, I started to think that maybe my abusive ex was right. Maybe it was my fault. I was the common denominator. I didn't want to disappoint anyone so I pretended I was fine.

It's been almost a year since that happened. Ive been in therapy. I have FINALLY overcome most of the shame & guilt. I've started being honest with people about what I've been through & what I need. I asked for more time to finish my degree & told my parents my graduation would be delayed. I have worked hard my whole life & I deserve the opportunity to show people what I can do when I'm not scared to death.

I flew home for spring break. Out of nowhere, my dad asked **if the other students in my year were graduating on time.**

A seemingly innocent question but the implication was loud & clear. I'm not as good as them. I'm not good enough. I'm not strong enough. I'm not trying hard enough. I've tried so hard, cried so much, & it's not enough. **I'm. Not.

I will never forgive myself,"I (20m) dated a (19f) girl online for three years. We fell in love and we planned to meet in real life. We clicked so well and texted and called each other every day. She was my whole world.  She was the most beautiful girl I’d ever seen with the voice of an angel. We wanted to marry each other I’m certain she was my soulmate. However she was from Iraq, the worst country in the world and her family were very religious. She was oppressed and controlled by her family, not being allowed to have any friends, was starved, and was to be married off to some 40 year old man. When her father and brothers found out she was talking to me, they took her phone away, beat her, broke both her arms and cracked her skull against the wall. I found out from her cousin that she died in hospital. And since there is no law in Iraq against domestic violence and police there don’t deal with family affairs they got away with it. Mentally broke me and I don’t know if I’m ever recover. Then her cousin who was talking to me over text at the time also got found out by the family and they strangled her as well. I’m the cause of two deaths.

Edit: 

Hello all. Thank you all so much for everyone that said kind words and offered advice it really does mean a lot to me in this time of grief. It feels so good to get this off my chest and I’m so glad that people are so kind and caring. I know I have such a long healing journey to go on but I am hopeful that I will make it through. I believe that my love is in a better place now and that god is taking care of her. I’ve tried to respond to most comments on here.  I also want to address a few things.

I know a lot of you doubt what I said and have called it fake, that she was a scammer, that I got catfished. The facts are that we dated for three years, face timed almost every day, called, texted sent snaps and pictures to each other. She never once asked or hinted at me to give her money and I never gave her money or gifts. Throughout the whole three years I never got the feeling that she was disingenuous or trying to scam me and I never gave anything to her. Either she must’ve really been in love like I was or she was the perfect actor who deserved an Oscar for three years of performance. Her cousin also sent me horrible photos of her in the hospital which I won’t go into detail about. So with these facts in mind I highly doubt that she was a scammer or that she was fake or a catfish. 

Also, this does not in any way mean to paint Islam or muslims in a bad light. Islam is a beautiful and amazing religion that everyone should look into. This is only a circumstance where the family was still stuck in the old traditions and justified their sinful actions to be that of gods will. My love, rest her soul, studied the true Islam and believed in the true Islam, where women and children are protected, despite being exposed to the “bad” way of Islam and becoming a victim of it. I hope this post doesn’t dissuade or discourage anyone from following Islam as it is truly beautiful.

I don't want to do anything anymore because of my depressed past of domestic violence and toxic friends.,"I know if I can get you to read this than there is a chance I won't fail at something... again.

I am an 18 YO wreck of a male human being.

In late 2012, my father showed my family that he was an infidel by apparently cheating on my mom. I don't know if it actually happened. It all broke loose in November of 2013 when they started arguing **again and again and AGAIN!!!!** until I can't remember a time when I was happy.

I have all toxic friends to the point now where I just don't talk to other people. In summer of 2013, I pulled the plug on a group of friends I had talked for far too long. I didn't have anybody else so I just stuck with them. We liked soccer, we played FIFA together, I was always the last wheel on the train. They always were mean to me. In the summer, we were playing soccer once and they intentionally broke my arm by kicking a soccer ball extremely hard into my arm, breaking it and I had to get it fixed. I have no friends anymore. **I HAVE NO FRIENDS ANYMORE.** Part of me wants to make new ones, but everyone is always mean to me, or I have become so pessimistic that I never have anything nice to say and quite honestly lost patience for dealing with other people. Sometimes, I dream of inventing a flick off foam finger, so I don't even have to go through the efforts of doing it.

I have been on what I call a downhill case of extreme depression to the point where I just don't want to even attempt at doing anything anymore. My domestic violence situation (notice how I *did not say domestic situation*) and the fact that I have nothing but toxic friends in my past just makes me not want to give any effort at anything anymore because I don't want to risk failing anymore. I can't do school anymore due to an inability to focus. I am in AP classes because I have cared up until now where I just don't even want to bother trying to believe in myself or trying at all for that matter anymore. I don't want to tell anyone because they will just drag me out of class and put me in a family counseling office, leaving me with a ton of make up work. I don't want to try to do better because I am really good at failing at being able to do things, so I feel that just not trying is only prolonging the inevitable or preventing what is destined to be.

I can't do anything right. Everything I do is just erroneous. I can't remember to brush my teeth, but when I do remember, I get toothpaste everywhere. I don't bother to eat in the presence of others because I always spill something. I don't bother to play video games anymore because people always kick me from parties or just say mean things which I don't want to hear. I'm not very good at the games I play either. I get depressed just looking at other people and families in public; it reminds me of how my family (or what is left of it) has failed me and how I have nobody. Sometimes I feel like walking up to other people and complimenting them on their families, but then I realize they will probably have something mean to say or think, like me being a creep for saying that to them, so instead I just don't bother. A bad habit of mine that I have when I get depressed is thinking too much about sex or intimate thoughts. That puts me on the wrong parts of reddit and just a bad place in my mind.

These past few days, I don't really want to do anything. I just want to sleep because I know that sleeping can't be done wrong. I don't really know what to do with myself though if I wake up. I go to sleep around 11 PM, wake up the next day around 9 AM, sometimes I'll get up, but then I'll remember how lonely I will be and how I'll just end up having the same day as yesterday, so I roll back over and actually get out of bed around 10 AM. When I get up, I walk downstairs, put the Price is Right on, and eat breakfast. I sometimes yell at the screen at how stupid people are bidding in hopes that I might hear a voice in return. I then watch TV because I know I can't do it wrong. Then, I start to get too familiar with the commercials and shut it off. I turn it back on a 3 PM to watch *Dr. Phil* and then *Judge Judy* afterward.

New gender neutral bathrooms at my yoga studio is triggering,"I live in Sydney and am a member at a high-end yoga studio in the inner city suburbs. I love this place and after suffering with PTSD from multiple sexual assaults and also domestic violence in a past relationship, the supportive environment of this studio has helped me begin to feel safe again and regular yoga practice has helped a lot with anxiety and PTSD episodes.

However…they have just renovated our toilets and bathrooms which include showers to be gender neutral…

The reason I’m so triggered is that after all the violence I’ve endured from men I don’t feel comfortable sharing a bathroom with strangers when I’m still in recovery, especially when so many of us women come out in a towel and get things from our lockers and do our makeup etc…it feels like a violation (having them in our private space) all over again. 

I am all for inclusion and equality and people feeling a part of things but this is too far. There are certain things that need to remain especially for women who don’t feel safe around ANY men post assaults and violence. 

My mother also commented that as a 70 year old woman who does yoga regularly, she wouldn’t want to shower in the bathroom with 20-something men using the toilet…the studio is out of touch.

I’m sure nothing would happen and everyone will be respectful but it feels like the studio is wanting to be up with the times rather than considering that a lot of women who go there might really need their privacy especially when it’s a place we come to feel safe, at peace and grounded. 

How do you guys feel about that? 
EDIT: guys meaning, a term for all people not men specifically. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1asocut/new_gender_neutral_bathrooms_at_my_yoga_studio_is/,t2_vgv2eklr,1708129633.0
I was almost murdered. I've never told anyone. I need to own my story. **Trigger warning domestic violence & rape,"Firstly, a foreward:


It's been a long road leading me to type this right now. If you've ever heard of Brene Brown, you'll know where I'm coming from. She's the researcher on shame, guilt, fear, vulnerability. I suffer from severe PTSD. She preaches that in order to overcome shame, we must own our story. It was only recently I realized I even felt ashamed. But I'm deeply, deeply ashamed. So ashamed, I can't speak of this to anyone I know personally. So off my chest is goes, and I tell my story. For the first time, for no other point than to tell it. Here goes.


Hi reddit,
I'm a 25 year old UX designer (I make websites pretty). I'm a single mother to a 4 year old boy. He rocks. He's my whole world. I live in a nice city, a small one. I grew up in los angeles. I lived there for 20 years.


Actually, I came here in the first place because I fled. I fled my abuser, my home, my friends. You see after a while, they all become one. So inextricably intertwined. I couldn't tell one from the other, my face from my nose. I ran. I was forced. I was kidnapped. I left. These are all true, it just depends how you want to look at it.


You see when I was 17 I met a guy. Not a nice guy necessarily, but a really really cool guy. He was so handsome. He had the dopest tattoos. He had a new york accent. He was so...different. Exactly what I was looking for. And he liked me too! Oh how he liked me.
After we were dating, things were fine for about a month. He was controlling and jealous, but not enough to break up over. Just enough to barely blip on my radar. Then one day, we were having friends over. You see we lived in the place to live. If this was NY, imagine we lived in the center of times square. People came up to party with us all the time. Strangers, randoms, all was welcome.
So one night we have people over, one friend of mine and some randoms/acquaintances. 


One random guy is super nice, he's a cop (I confirmed, he was off-duty). He tells me he's rolling. I offer to give him a massage, because I used to take ecstasy too and I know how nice it is. I ask my bf for permission first, he says go ahead.


At some point the guy put his head in my lap. My bf walked over and slapped me. He doesn't deserve privacy, I'm going to call him by his name. His name was Chase. At least that's what he went by. It was his middle name, really his first name was Connor.



He just slapped me right in the fucking face. I was appalled, in shock, and everybody silently left. Everybody, silently, left. When I type that I feel hot knives searing my stomach. Fuck you guys. They were all men. All much bigger and braver than I was. I remember the cop saying ""I feel like I should leave you guys alone now..""
and that was it. They left. And I stayed. I stayed. It was a light slap after all. It didn't hurt. It just surprised me. I guess I'd crossed a line that I never saw drawn in the sand. Of course I shouldn't have done that. What woman in her right mind would've let that guy put his head in my lap? I was acting afool. I was lowering myself. He was just lifting me up to the standards I should be holding myself too. Plus, he apologized. He was deeply sorry that he lost his temper.
I mean, I'm not perfect? How can he be? Plus his slap didn't even hurt. It's not like I'm a battered woman. It's not like I could possibly ever become that. I'm at no risk. I forgave a one time mistake and that's it. It ever happens again and I'm leaving you. You bet your ass I'm leaving you.



And it didn't happen again for a long time. But I just kept fucking up. I didn't know what was wrong with me, but I just kept fucking up. I was getting reminders. I looked at the delivery guy too long when he brought our pizza. My old guy friend texted me to see how I was doing. I exchanged pleasantries with our doorman. I didn't realize it at the time, but I was really fucking up. He told me all about it afterwards. I didn't realize how I was disrespecting him, but the way I talked to other guys made them think I was into them you see? They all thought I liked them! And the ones that liked me, well that was because I made them think that. Even if I said nothing, I looked like a ""w**re"" so they thought I was easy.


It's funny, they never liked me because I was smart, funny, pretty, or interesting. But only because I looked easy. I took note and changed the way I dressed. Started averting my eyes. I stared at my shoes. I forgot people's names. There's no point when they're all the same.



You see to him I was the tornado. He was the volcano. Yeah -- he loved that song.


I started to learn my lessons. I grew to adapt. I was a chameleon in a chameleon's world. I learned my place. I looked down. I spoke when spoken to. I knew the look. The look that said it all. The look that chills me to my bones as I type this.


But then came the big day. The one you're probably reading this for. The ""juicy bits."" It was August 6th of 2010. (My son was born on this exact day 2 years later.)


He bought pills that day - xanax. 2 mg. I remember. He took a lot. I took a few too. We sat by the pool at our apartment complex, in sweltering heat, our shirts sticking to our skin. We made plans for the day, for the evening, everything seemed so bright.


My memory is spotty here, so bare with me please. At some point, we argued about something. He demanded we go up to my room. I refused, I stayed behind with friends. I took a stand. Finally.
You could see the pool from my room, and vice versa. He stormed up. I could see him watching me. I watched the lights flicker on and off - you see it was night, so he could only see me with the lights off.
Eventually I say, hey I'll go up, I'll see what's wrong. I go up and he's dranken a fifth of vodka to himself. He seems passed out on the couch. I go near to see if he's okay, and he bursts up, pointing a knife at me.


I don't remember what he said. But it was scary enough that I backed out the door, and ran to the elevator. He caught up with me. He was bigger, taller, faster, stronger. I frantically pushed the down button. I punched that button with all my might. He made it first.
I felt a sharp blow to my upper thigh and I was on the floor. Then my keys flew into the wall, lodging just above my eye, sticking straight out. I grasped my leg, already bruising, and tried to get to my feet. He kicked me. He fucking kicked me with all his force.
I ran back into the apartment. I grabbed a kitchen knife. I remember saying ""You think you're the only one that can pull a knife?"" I don't remember what he said.


Next I remember trying to flee the apartment. He grabbed me so hard, caught my clothes that he tore them clean off me. I didn't even think that was possible. At some point I made it downstairs and ran to a friend's apartment. From there I ran to the apartment complex across the street. Our weed dealer lived there. I trusted him.
He saw how fucked up I was. I was crying and my nose was bleeding. I had a black eye too. The first words out of his mouth will be burned into my memory forever. He said ""Alice...I've wanted you from the moment I saw you."" I said ""Chase beat me"" and he ushered me to his bed ready to tuck me in and comfort me. He gave me a pill to help me feel better.


The next thing I remember is waking up and he's trying to have sex with me. He's trying to shove it in, I have my legs shut tight. I'm resisting, so, so hard. I'm crying no. The next thing I remember he is getting up to throw away the condom.


He carries me home. Lays me down in my bed. Chase bursts out from the bathroom (he was hiding in there, why? only makes sense to him I'm sure). He grabbed my bong and smashed it. And then he walked over and punched me in the head as hard as he could (he admitted that later). I saw stars, colors, heard noises, and I was out. When I woke up Alex (dealer) was gone. It must've just been a few minutes. He threw me out of the bed. He choked me up against the wall. He punched me in the face. Over and over. I was crawling. Trying to get away. He grabbed two butcher knives. He cut my throat with one, the other he poked at my stomach, stabbing at my flesh.


I screamed as loud as I could. I cried for my mommy, my daddy, the police, god. I was about to die and I knew it.


I keep crawling. Finally I'm making some progress. I've reached the door. Thank fucking god. If I can just reach the handle. But he's back again. And I feel a blow to my head so hard I think my brain is leaking out. He kicked my head. He's kicking my head. Over and over. Against the bathroom door frame. My cheek is broken, I can feel it. My brain is swelling, I swear I can feel it. And I'll never get away.


Then he does the unthinkable. Yanks my dress up and starts jamming his fingers into me while screaming ""is this what alex did to you is this what you want you fucking slut."" I guess Alex told him we had sex. They fucking smoked a cigarette together before abusing me.


Alex saw him punch me. He fucking left. A rapist and a coward.
The last thing I remember is my head getting kicked in. The next thing I remember is waking up the next morning with 12 officers at my door. They arrest him. I look in the mirror. I look like an alien. I collapse. I have no memory. They take me to the hospital. I have severe concussions. Fractures. My throat was slit. I look like I'm already dead.


He's arraigned.

Sometimes I feel like I forgive you Chase, and sometimes I feel like strangling you slowly while watching the life calmly leave your eyes and furiously masturbating to the sight of it. 

And I'm sorry. I'm sorry I just can't anymore. If anyone reads this, I can tell the rest of the story tomorrow. But not tonight. Not tonight.
Anyone going through the same thing I know you feel the same way, but you're NOT alone and you ARE strong and capable and beautiful. Please, if you're in need, reach out to me and I'll be here night and day for you. It only gets worse my babies.


I doubt anyone read this, but if you did, you're a trooper, thanks for hearing my story.",https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/4z4cea/i_was_almost_murdered_ive_never_told_anyone_i/,t2_10svj2,1471920539.0
Today my ex-abuser texted me saying he’d never let me go. I believe him.,"**Trigger warning as this post will contain descriptions of domestic violence and suicide**

Awhile back I started dating a mutual friend. It didn’t start out as anything serious, but quickly turned exclusive. 

Slowly red flags emerged. Making me purge my Instagram of photos he deemed revealing and removing male followers. 

Then almost all at once the serious abuse began. I wasn’t allowed to text any of my male friends, he was going through my phone on the regular. I was expected to be with him 24/7 and when I wasn’t, he tracked my location. 

Any social events I did without him would be met with hundreds of texts and phone calls accusing me of cheating, call me names, and threatening violence or suicide.

I would come running back. Every. Single. Time. I would leave social events. I cut off contact with my family because he told me my mom was “out to split us up”. I lied to my friends about the severity of the abuse. 

After one particularly rough weekend I visited my moms house covered in bruises. At this point I was living with my abuser and seeing my family scarcely. After a tearful phone call between myself, my dad and my mom, we decided it would be best if I moved in with my dad, who lived across the country.

This move changed me profoundly. I have a new job and managed to even make a few friends. I’m safe and for the most part happy. But he is still able to control aspects of my life from 1500 miles away.

He bombards me daily with texts and anonymous number phone calls. For every number I block he creates a new one (an app I’m assuming). Daily for the past 4 months I’ve been called vile names and threatened. Everyday, I’m subjected to some sort of fresh hell. Everyday, I dread having to use my phone and usually keep it powered down. 

Today, I finally caved and texted back asking why he can’t just leave me alone. He simply responded “Because I’ll never let you go.” 

Out of everything I’ve gone through this terrified me the most. I just want this to end. I’m so tired of fighting. So tired of living in constant fear and anxiety. I just want this to end.

Edit: Wow! Thank you everyone for the comments, support and suggestions. To everyone that has gone through a similar situation, I am sending you love and healing. Your words have helped me realize I am not alone in this situation and I appreciate them more than you know.

Also as many of you suggested I will be changing my phone number, I’m going into T-mobile today.",https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/rmmok1/today_my_exabuser_texted_me_saying_hed_never_let/,t2_hj2fjj3w,1640232480.0

"(TW: rape, domestic violence, prostitution) A friend told me a lot of the horrible things he had to experience as a kid and I'm extremely heartbroken","For some context, I've known this person for nearly 10 years now. I've always known he had it tough growing up but I never thought it was *this* bad. He told me his dad was a pimp who used his mom for easy money, and that he had to witness her job sometimes when he was a kid because she did it in the same house where he lived. His mom escaped his dad when he was like 5 but left both her kids, and he still lives with his dad who also tried to kill him. It makes me unbearably sad. 

&#x200B;

I've had other friends tell me equally horrible things they've experienced but I never get used to it. It never gets easier knowing that your loved ones suffer so much and go through so much. 

&#x200B;

It makes me feel guilty for having grown in a normal home with a loving family, living a normal life and being in recovery for my mental illness. I wish I could do something to make those horrible things go away. But I know from personal experience how hard it is to let go of the past. If I feel this bad over it, I can't even begin to imagine how my friend feels about it, and that makes everything even worse. 

&#x200B;

But there's this one friend in particular (not the one I'm refering to in the title) who recently drunkenly disclosed that her step-dad raped her daily for 7 years. I've known her for at least 5 years now. I feel sick in my stomach thinking that I used to think she was exaggerating when she said she hated him. Now that I know why I fucking hate myself for it. I should've known better. Wtf past me. I don't deserve her friendship and I don't even know why she stuck with me.

"The rantings of a twenty three year old BPD sufferer. [Triggers: rape, domestic violence, depression, self harm, alcoholism]","I am sick of being a fucking zombie.

I am sick of my fucking normalcy depending on fluoxetine to subsist.

I am sick of thinking, if my new boyfriend knew what I was like off my pills, he wouldn't want to know me.

Just like the others.

I am sick of never being able to sleep comfortably, to be woken by nightmares, waking my boyfriend with my convulsing and crying in my sleep.

I am sick of going through stages where I'm completely numb about when I was sexually assaulted by an acquaintance eleven months ago. I was out at night and drunk. I was separated from my friends, lost and on the verge of throwing up, very disorientated. He offered to take me home. You'd think he'd know when I fucking threw up in his car that I was in no right mind to consent. The worst feeling I've ever encountered was waking up, my room trashed, naked in my bed with no idea how I got naked and then finding the used condom on my desk next to me. Then finding my puke-covered clothes. I felt like I would never be clean, no matter how I scrubbed. Besmirched. Intensely vulnerable and betrayed and completely filthy. I go through months when I can talk quite candidly about it and it doesn't faze me. But it's the times when everything reminds me of it that it eats away at me entirely.

I am so sick of my dad's words running through my head all the time. 
'You will never amount to anything. You are a useless piece of shit. I wish your mother never had you, you're a stupid disgrace and a complete embarrassment.'

I am so sick of feeling I'd be so much better off dead, but knowing it would completely destroy my mother.

I'm sick of having to rely on drinking to feel something. This medication mutes my emotions so much. I almost wish I could experience the dizzying lows just to feel the euphoric highs. The only time I feel happy and friendly to be around is when I'm drunk. Then I sober up and I second guess everything I said or did and drunk guilt utterly consumes me to the point of tears and the depressive cycle starts again.

Just so sick of everything.",https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/263rr8/the_rantings_of_a_twenty_three_year_old_bpd/,t2_cgk71,1400660399.0
Getting dunked on Twitter on a 0 follower account was wild,"So there is this Indonesian domestic violence case that has gone viral past in the few days. I mainly use Twitter to vent and catch up with online school on that account, it was unlocked with 0 follower and the name is still default to what Twitter had generated. It's basically name + some number account.

So yesterday I was quote tweeting the tweet about the news, mainly I tweet to myself to let some ruminating thought out. I didn't defend the perpetrator, just saying how crazy it is that a private matter like domestic violence and subsequent running away from their home that the victim did could go this viral (it was huge news for a few days in the nation). On that note, the victim is safe rn as far as I know.

So I was surprised finding out an account with 20k followers just dunked on my tweet, mind you with 0 follower 😂. Reading everyone's reaction is pretty crazy as well, like people take so much offense that I said DV case is a private matter I guess. Some of the responses are wild as well, it really feels like I said something offensive but it really wasn't the case. Some of the responses really act like I was defensing the perpetrator. Though it's genuinely wild how passionate they seem to respond to a burner account with 0 follows.

I just think the victim probably would be stressed with this much attention to the case. 🤷‍♀️ I guess I'm just saying, it would be different if I really did type something offensive but it really wasn't the case. On that note, I just locked that account for now lol.

But seriously why respond to burner/troll looking account with minimal following, geez. It feels weird to come back and seeing you got the ""villain of the day"" treatment for a tweet that meant to be just for yourself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/180lcx6/getting_dunked_on_twitter_on_a_0_follower_account/,t2_6jk79hzt,1700585152.0

It's strange.. when I think about work I don't feel stressed, and when I am about to go to work I'm excited.

My childhood fucked me up. And I’m scared to tell my therapist because my parents are better now and I don’t want someone to take my sisters away. TW Domestic Violence,"This is going to be a ride. So buckle up.
I’m 19 M. As a kid had ODD which is basically I couldn’t handle authority properly when I was a child. I had constant anger issues and authority figures were like my enemies. I hated my teachers cause they told me what to do and I hated my principal cause I always got sent to the office but even more then that I hated my dad. 

When I was growing up my parents used a lot of physical “discipline” they would whoop me in order to get me to follow the rules. I was really young but I remember I would hide from my dad whenever I knew these whoopings were coming. I admit I was a really bad kid. I threw things off my teachers desk, I screamed up and down the hallways, and in preschool I even attacked a pregnant teacher. It’s not like I didn’t know that these things were wrong I just would do them. The part of my brain that would tell a normal person not to do something I guess just wasn’t there. So I would do something bad and then come home and my dad would whoop me in order to get me to stop. I remember when he was done he would force me to stop crying or he would whoop me again. My skin would raise from where he hit me and I could touch them and they would still sting. He would just hit me everywhere. I would run but he always caught me and he would grab my arm and just start swinging with his belt. I would still squirm but thaf only mad it worse. The pain wasn’t the worst part though. The worst part would be waiting for it to happen. 

My mom would get me from school and I would wait in my room. I was raised religious and I would pray everytime that my dad wouldn’t come home. I would hear his car pull up and I knew it would be to late. I’d sit in the corner of my room and cry and listen to him get settled in the house. Sometimes he wouldn’t come in immediately and he’d just get settled but other times he’d just rush in and get me. If he got settled first then he would come in with his belt and sit me down and explain to me what I did wrong and make me understand. Then he would try and calm me down and tell me that I earned this whoopin so I should sit still and take it. Sometimes I would and it would be quick other times I would try my luck but if I tried my luck or I cried or screamed to loud it just make it worse. As I got older I learned to just take it. It would hurt but I learned to stop crying until he left.

One of the worst whoopins I got though was when he was mad but this one was beyond bad. I don’t remember what I did but I remember I was on the floor and my mom was as beating me it was one of the few times o had every gotten a whooping from my mom and I knew my aunt E and Uncle A were downstairs so I screamed extra loud 
1) To embarrass my parents for not teaching their child to be quiet when being whooped 
2) For help

My dad ran up the steps and whooped me everywhere it was one of the few times I got hit in the face more than once. When he let me go I went to my room but when I looked to see if my aunt and uncle were there they had left. Looking back on it that was a stupid call on my part because everyone in my family whoops their children. I thought it was normal to be honest. I didn’t realize until I was in my senior year of HS that other parents didn’t whoop their kids. My sister and I would talk about how we would whoop our kids because we thought it was a necessary part of parenting like hugging or family time. 

As I got older they stopped whooping my sister and I Amy youngest sister is 6 and they nearly never hit her and when they do it’s with a hand and it’s two licks on the but and that’s it. It makes me so happy seeing that they don’t actually hurt her. 

Growing up my dad couldn’t figure out why I didn’t like him though and I think that’s why they don’t hit the girls. I hated my dad. Our relationship is still a bit tainted. I came back from college though and I told them I was going to therapy and I would need a new therapist that’s not from my college and how I had been dealing with depression and anxiety and how my therapist thought I could also have bipolar disorder which sucks cause I already have ADHD and now both my parents are much more accepting and kind. It’s a nice change. They’re so nice now I kind of don’t know how to handle it. How they act now is how I wish they acted my entire childhood. 
 
I want to tell my therapist these things but I’m really scared. When I was a kid getting beat I wanted to tell someone but I didn’t then for the same reason I haven’t now. My sisters are my everything. When I was being bullied in middle school I was going to kill myself but I was scared that my sister would find me or that would traumatize her. I thought it I told someone they would take my sisters to CPS and they would get separated because the middle sister is a bit old for adoption but my baby sister would get adopted quick because she’s a baby. Then my middle sister would live her life in the system. Now I’m scared because I don’t want my therapist to have to say something because I realize that all of that sounds horrible and all of this sounds like domestic violence but my dad never hurt my mom and he would never hurt my mom and they are both way better at raising their kids. I was just really bad and they didn’t know any other way of discipline. 
BUT I also recognize that ... this traumatized me. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to shake it unless I actually talk to someone about it. I’ve never told another soul the extent of the whoopings I’ve never  said out loud that my dad was abusive. I think o need to work it out but I’m terrified because I can’t do that to my sisters. I love everyday for them. I wake up every morning because I know they woke up. I’m supposed to be their lead example as a big brother so how could I ever chance possibly putting them in a bad situation. 

If you read this far congrats. I didn’t realize how much I had to share. It’s been sitting in my chest for a long time. I knew that I was pretty fucked up because of this but this runs deeper then I allowed myself to think apparently.",https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/ftzeeb/my_childhood_fucked_me_up_and_im_scared_to_tell/,t2_619nvvm0,1585878925.0
