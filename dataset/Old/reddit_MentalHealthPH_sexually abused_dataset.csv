Free therapy services for sexually abused women,"I am so tired paying the consequences of my trauma and losing physical contact with friends just made it worse. Online interactions are especially hazardous when I'm at vulnerable or impulsive state 'cause it feels like I'm only looking for solutions to all this distress online, like solving all my issues is just one click away.

I'm a BP 1. I got hypersexuality issues and I can feel myself falling back into the tunnel. I'm starting to crave for attention again, whilst knowing I'll never get anything out of it, except feeling validated for a fleeting moment.

I heard from someone that there are women's organization that offers therapy service for free. I contacted her but unfortunately I haven't gotten any replies from her for months now.

"should i go for therapist or psychiatrist? CPTSD, sexual trauma, living with csa perp and narcissistic mom + abusive household.","MIs: major depressive disorder, social anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, NSSI

Situation: Poor physical condition to leave the house. No funds. Controlling Mother.

Conditions: Consultations with doctor needs to be online.

therapy or psychiatrist? i have physical disabilities din (i am not sure if i can apply PWD). hopefully nothing over 1,000 PHP per session, please?

Context: My ex boyfriend gave me a lot of sexual trauma that has proven to be worse and more of a hurdle in my everyday life than my other MIs combined, even the CSA and Rape wasn't as bad as what he did to me. He's not necessarily a bad person, but I did suffer a lot and developed traumas I cannot get rid of, the nightmares are still there, there are physical activities I cannot do and even talking to people online is proving to be uncomfortable. I believe I have CPTSD.

Should I see a psychiatrist or a therapist? I want to heal.

Cavite area, please consider replying and offering me help and resources. I'm reaching out. thank you.

Met a horrible psychiatrist in QC,"I went to this psychiatrist to get medication for my ocd/anxiety. She kept insisting that I bring my mom so she could figure out my family’s medical history but I kept explaining that I’m an adult and we don’t have that sort of relationship, bringing my parent would only make me uncomfortable. But she insisted it was needed so I brought my mom for the next session. She asked about our medical records then proceeded to tell her about CONFIDENTIAL topics between her and I. She told my mom my s*icide attempt and sexual abuse, both of which I have never told anyone in my life. But there she was, sharing my story without my consent. Of course it broke my mom. My chest hurt so bad. I tried to explain that I felt really disregarded as a person, it was like my opinion didn’t matter and the doctor tried to argue that parents should know everything. Again, I am a young adult. This was my first time approaching health professionals. I respectfully explained how she did not have the right to do that, to which she responded ""edi humanap ka ng ibang doctor."" That made me cry harder, and then she turned to my mom and said ""di ko responsibilidad buhay mo[me], responsibilidad mo yan[my mom]."" and told us that I was ""mental.""

So yeah. idk I really hope her clinic shuts down.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/18ynggb/met_a_horrible_psychiatrist_in_qc/,t2_qbzku7gv,1704401180.0

I have OCD and I fear I harmed a child,"
Hi. I suffer from severe OCD caused by emotional abuse. I’m on meds and I’m in list for a therapy. I have a strange compulsion.  I lick my lips sexually and slowly with a sexual expression in my face,like I’m seducing someone. In order to see how this could be seen by others, I did this looking in glasses of parked cars. Now I’m afraid. What If there was a child in it? What if he/she saw me? I think he/she could feel scared, especially if he/she was 11-12 years and can understand sex. Or maybe he or she had an history of sexual abuse. The possibility of hurting a minor is a nightmare for me. 
What do you think? Did I harm a minor?

What is wrong with me ? TW,"TW : pedo, rape, abuse, sexual abuse.

Something is really wrong with me and I can’t talk about it to anyone, ´cause l am deeply ashamed. 

When I was a little girl, one of my family members raped me multiple times. Also, when i was 9-10yo, 5 boys of my class used to touch me and another girl. 

No need to say these things are very hard for a child to bear.

The thing is, now I’m 17. I used to follow an account on twitter that would share accounts to report because they would share or like p€do p0rn0graphy. So I went on an account to report it and I saw the videos that were shared by this account. Children getting s€xu@lly abused. And I felt excited and disgusted at the same time, discusted because how could someone do this to children, AND WHY WOULD THAT EXCITE ME ? So i closed the video, reported the account and then I cried because I was disgusted by myself.
Was I a pedophile even though children were not attractive to me, and though I’ve never even thought of « sleeping » with one ?

But then I saw a video on the internet of an adult woman getting r@p€d. It also made me horny. But also mad for what was happening to the woman in the video.

So now I think that r@p€ excites me. The idea of ME getting r@p€d makes me horny and i feel so ashamed to talk about it. 

Anyone tell me why am I like this ? What the hell is wrong with me ? 


I would never do such a thing to anyone but why is it attractive when it’s about ME getting raped ?",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/17zvf0d/what_is_wrong_with_me_tw/,t2_cg74mw7j5,1700505376.0
I think I'm a psychopath but not the serial killer type,"So I would like to ask the community if I am a psychopath or just a broken man trying my best to live with the trauma that was inflicted to me when I was young. 

About me: 

* Sexually abused when I was 4 and 6 years old and even when I was in college but I don't really feel anything about it. I do use it sometimes so people can relate to me. 
* Middle child, the only physically abused kid of the family who is hated by his dad because I was/am very brave and palaban. I've held a knife in front of my dad when I was 10 while shouting at him.
* Dad almost cut me off but I was able to look for ways, I was able to become independent at the age of 16, fully financially independent at the age of 20. 
* Started self harm (cutting) for coping and later on for pleasure and for more reasons. I look at twitter beans and styro as a past time or when I want to sleep. I'm not one of those emo asking for help and attention.
* Not suicidal but I've done some dangerous stuff just because I feel like being crazy. Not afraid to die as well not because I believe in after life but because I understand the science behind our existence in this world.
* I am very conscious about a lot of things especially on consequences that can benefit me. 
* Intelligent, I guess. Very rational.  Graduated in a prestigious Uni. I am very calculating. I am of course very skilled and have an awesome career. I've never felt insecure as well. I feel like I've always controlled how my brain works.
* Very unemotional -- or should I say controlled reactions. I am able to show emotions of course but I am so conscious on its purpose that I would always think that it's very manipulating.
* I have trouble understanding love and why a lot of people seem to die when they don't have that connection with other people. 
* I've killed animals -- cute ones, as a culling procedure. Never felt pity but the high that it gave me is scary good. Never killed human beings of course, it's against the law and it's very disadvantageous on my part and there is no purpose for doing it. Also, a big, social animal like us is very difficult to just make it disappear. Such a waste of time and resources.  
* I am very charismatic and I feel like the world is my theater and I am always acting. I have no trouble getting people to like me. The key is to fully separate your ego from the character you're playing.

Broken from the start,"
How can this broken art be fix again, is not really easy. 
This dark paint, a mistake from the past,
An irreversible taint that took all the beauty
That this art could have, is still there

It is so sad, I just finished walking for 20minutes, and I sit down. Then at the moment I thought I am okay, I got hit by thoughts of how useless I am.

God, I am trying to fix it. Talking to myself, that I am not the problem, I have a problem. Yet, I envied people, that have nothing hurtful from their past. How can I tottally accept that everything happens for a reason, that I just don't see the bigger picture right now.

Crying while writing this, I hope by writing this I could get some realization, and the pain on my chest would subside.

Nakakainggit sila God, how good they are with other people  socializing. How can I move pass this, no one understand how hard it is for me to face others, I can't even look people in the eye.

I open up to someone about this lately, someone special, maybe I am just wrong, but now that wala na siya, I somehow think that maybe because of my stories, past, and present.

What if there I have a healthy childhood memories? No sexual abuse or trauma from gossips? Would I be like them? Oh God, it hurts to think that I still struggle from this even if I am 29y na. How would I percept the world if none of it happened? Will I be normal? What is normal?

One more weird thing to mention from age 10 to 14 I watched S**ual stuff and other things that tokophobia mentions and it is probably the start of all this. During the age range I was okay with that stuff then but probably my subconscious mind didn't like that and then it clicked with the phobia.)

I think I'm using sex to self-destruct,"TW: Cheating, Depression, Suicidal Ideations, Sexual Encounters and Extreme Fetishes/Kinks (?)

I'm currently working with a Major Depressive Disorder diagnosis and me and my psychiatrist are looking if this can also/if it is ADHD and/or Generalized Anxiety Disorder. All in all I know there is an issue and I have been medicated since November 2022. The meds I think work to an extent like I no longer have the strong urge to jump infront of the MRT, climb an overpass over EDSA, or break the office window and jump from the highrise office. I have been very risky with my sexual encounters though...

It started 2 months before seeing my psychiatrist, a month before I'm medicated--beginning with me installing Grindr and just going to people's places to give head or be blown. Started with the random hookup here and there, until I just seem to wake up and fall asleep to someone fucking me. I wake up and scroll thru the app for the next guy/s that will have sex with me, do the same at work, and when I go home. I'm averaging about 2-3 guys A DAY at this point and peaked at 6 guys and seven rounds of sex. Then I started going... maybe what others see as ""extreme"" like exhibitionism and voyeurism, and even willfully hooking up and actively sought for partnered/married men. That is on top of unprotected sex with random strangers.

It hasn't hit me that I have been that... wild with my sex life until I shared my sex history to a friend after some rounds of drinks. He was taken aback to say the least, hearing his friend being so hypersexual, if that's the right term at this point. Scolded me for being a 'hypocrite' because I was in a HIV Advocacy org in college and here I am getting bred by random people every day and night. Honestly, I really did not pay much thought to it until that moment. 

Yes I haven't been abusing substances, nor am I doing self-harm, and I do get into the occasional stupor of depression pero... never sumagi sa isip ko that this hypersexuality (aka hoe phase kuno) is also a form of self-destruction. Never bothered testing for HIV and Syphilis, never thought of going on PrEP, even encouraging  people to fulfil their deepest and darkest fantasies without any regard to my comfort or safety (extreme sexual requests and positions with my partners). I even encourage them to ""use me as they desire"" and even have rape fantasies.

Honestly, I'm so unsure anymore about where I stand on sex, is this even normal pa ba? Is it a kink? Is it something I should raise na to my psychiatrist? Hindi ko na rin alam minsan if the purpose of me having sex is to have fun or just escape kasi nagmimix na ang dalawa and hirap akong ihiwalay. Andaming what if and honestly I'm so unsure how to even approach this. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/15g931i/i_think_im_using_sex_to_selfdestruct/,t2_gr1ooie69,1690983255.0
Memories,"TW: Mention of sexual abuse/assault


Since bata (4) pa I have these memories of being touched inappropriately by someone close to me. For years napapaginipan ko sya and I find myself waking up at night because of it. I have a great memory dati kaya every detail nung pangyayari naalala ko. I never talked about it kahit kanino because I don't know if importante yun, later ko na lang din nalaman na it was an assault hindi pa ako sure if I'm still a virgin. I'm quite hypersexual kahit nung nasa elem pa, I just started doing things na normally hindi gagawin ng 9 year old. I also experienced being catcalled, nasa elem pa lang ako nun kaya whenever papasok magka holding hands kami ng ate ko. Being around men makes me really uncomfortable lalo na older men. Idk but something on them screams danger to me. I also don't want to be touched, muntik ko na dati masuntok classmate ko kase inakbayan ako, tsaka lang ako nasanay dahil dun sa best friend ko na walang ginawa kundi yakapin ako whenever she sees me. 

Blurry na yung pangyayari and I already let it go kase di ko alam kung sino yun (coping mechanism na rin siguro ng brain ko is to forget things na di ko kaya itake). Lumipat na kami ng bahay before ako mag 5, idk if matutuwa ako kase nakaiwas ako dun sa gumawa nun sakin, or malungkot kase panibagong trauma natanggap ko after lumipat. Lol my life sucks, dami ko encounter ng sexual assault as a kid pati grooming. If I think about it napaka prone namin ng mga kapatid ko dati sa grooming dahil sa itsura namin, thank fck kase kinuha temporarily nung tita ko bunso namin at least hindi nya na experience mga so weird na matatanda.

dark poetry,"The presence of my demon in the mirror draws nearer

I feel sympathy for those exposed, battle-worn eyes

Purpose for my descension and ascension became clearer

It’s a symphony orchestra when the battle horn cries

I learned my words touch souls

Dispersed across the world

Childhood pain metamorphed into a passion

We would play the game Duck Hunt

Then a game under the covers

Innocence shifted in a way I couldn’t fathom

Back in the early nineties

Sister was 5 and I was 3

Babysitter on the bed spread

Spreadin one cheek west and one cheek east

No physical harm caused

We just stared alarmingly

Tried coaxing us a couple times

Said to let our garments free

Sis and I were with our mom one night

Mustered up courage and started to speak

He seemed so friendly and neighborly 

Acted charismatic, charming as could be

Parents geared up for a fucking war

Only thing missing were the army fatigues

Twenty one, living with his aunt and uncle

He too was toyed with as a youth

The cycle continues to perpetuate 

That doesn’t make it an excuse

I’ve read that 1 in 13 boys go through

Some form of child sexual abuse

Worse for girls, it’s 1 in 4

And we’re expected to not grow up so confused?

Are all these underlying issues 

The reason why I live like a recluse?

Hard to fit into society

It’s easier fitting into a noose 

Maybe I’ll give a try at sobriety

Thinking about Moving Out of My Parent's House,"Hi, good day! I'll post the exact trigger warnings before I discuss my story so here:

TW: sexual abuse, child molestation, and depression

Last June of 2022, I had my first therapy appointment because in reality I had not been feeling well mentally. It only took one session for my doctor to diagnose me with MDD. The story is I was molested when I was a child, I remember trying to sleep and there was this man who shoved his fingers down my pants. I was frozen and didn't know what I could do. I thought I dreamt that up but this man continued to do it for several years. 

I have known that man since I was a child since he is a very close friend of my father. Whenever he would stay at our home, he'd find ways to touch me, passing it off as a ""massage"", starting from my foot and rising up my body to grope my private area and my chest. He'd do it especially when my parents aren't around. At the time, I really didn't understand what was happening, I was only so young. He'd ask me if it was ok to ""massage"" and I don't usually respond because I was frozen, during the whole time he'd do it, I just dissociate and imagine something in my brain until it passes.

He continued doing that but it got worse in 2020-2021. Since we didn't have a helper at our home, he was tasked to take care of us so it would just be him, my brother, and I. I'd spend most of my time in my room but when I have to eat or watch TV, he'd start doing those ""massages"" again. By that time I was already 15-17 and at this point, I had really thought I'd get used to it. If you asked me why I didn't report this to my parents: (1) I felt immense shame and guilt, I felt so dirty to have been touched by someone who is supposed to be an adult (2) I felt that if I told them, my father would hate me for it. He's much closer to this friend of his than he is with us and I have always tried to seek my father's approval, reporting him (the guy) as the perpetrator would only damage our relationship. Or, I have a fear that no one would believe me if I said something and that people would say that I'm only ""faking"" what happened. Additionally, he'd always do it when my brother is not in the room.

Either way, it led to me having depressive episodes, I didn't know it yet but I would not shower for days, I would starve myself just so that I don't have to be around him, and I didn't care about my grades anymore because I'd rather be in bed. It was such a difficult time for me and my whole social life, emotional health, shs grades, and mental health suffered badly.

Sooner or later, we were able to find a helper and because of that, he was no longer needed in our house; instead, he'd go with my father wherever he goes. I just wanted to say that I felt like I was emotionally manipulated into thinking he was a good guy, since he'd usually take my side in things but now I realize that despite those memories that doesn't erase the fact that he's a disgusting pedophile and a  sexual abuser who took advantage of a minor.

After those events, I had become better, I started being able to take care of myself again and I became so happy knowing I didn't have to experience that again. But the thing is, I kept that whole thing by myself. And maybe that's why the whole time I was just so angry and upset. My ex boyfriend and I were in a relationship during that time and I'd say that he took the brunt of my anger. Anything - whether big or small - could make me tick. I was essentially toxic and would emotionally and verbally abuse my brother and my ex. I just couldn't handle my anger.

To cut it short, I decided to cut off my relationship with him and decided to socially withdraw from all my friends last year. I spent my time just watching shows and movies. I felt that in my anger and experience, I wasn't dealing with it healthily.

That's why I convinced my mom to get me to therapy and I broke down on my first appointment to my doctor about all of these experiences. She considered me for PTSD, BPD, or MDD but she settled with the lattermost condition. It felt so good to finally be able to tell someone about it, I felt as if the weight of being SA'd was lifted, even by a bit. Also yes, I recognized I was toxic and started repairing my relationships with my family and friends , and because of her, I managed to deal with my emotions and MDD. I was also prescribed anti depressants for it.

Now in April 2023, after almost a year of that event, I feel really numb to be honest. I still have recurring depressive episodes and my doc had to up my dose to 30mg Fluoxetine. Even then, I'd still see the guy at least 2x a month and lately, I've been having flashbacks to the SA that happened. For example, I go out of my room and see the couch where the ""massages"" happened, Id have intrusive and wanted memories of it. And essentially, I no longer feel safe in my own house. My doctor mentioned this as my mental health would still be impacted when he's around. It's not as worse as it was but I still have low energy and motivation for anything in my life.

So what I'm trying to say is I want to convince my doc to convince my parents if it's possible to change my environment - that being, the physical. Because maybe if I move out of town, I don't have to see him as much and I don't have to be under the suffocating hands of my semi-toxic parents. My mom is improving naman with dealing with this (context: she's a christian who thinks that this happened because I don't pray to god anymore) but my father on the other hand invalidated my experience by saying that, ""it is something that I should forget because it's in the past."" Still, my parents act like it's a nuisance to them and told me not to divulge this at all to anyone for the fear of judgment and stigma. 

Either way, I'm really hoping that by studying out of town or just being out of my hometown will help me improve my mental health. Any thoughts/advice on this?

TL;DR I was abused as a child until I was almost an adult (5-17) by my father's best friend, mainly in my own home. Hoping to convince my psychiatrist if it's better for me to study outside of my hometown so my environmental stressors lessen. Would love your thoughts on this, thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/12zbgo4/thinking_about_moving_out_of_my_parents_house/,t2_d7bygbnc,1682499359.0
"Have you ever thought that therapy would fix everything, and it just hasn’t? And now you’re just more depressed","TW: suicidal thoughts, mentions of SA

I was really excited to start seeing a psychologist and psychiatrist because I’ve been having mental health problems since I was really young. I was in survival mode for most of my life, and honestly just clung on to the hope that everything would work out once I’m financially stable and could afford seeking professional help. I worked 1-2 jobs to put myself through school, then worked 16-hour days after I graduated to save up.

I started seeing a psychologist January of last year and a psychiatrist July of last year. I can’t say I’ve found someone that’s a good match for me yet. Meds didn’t really help? I’ve tried sertraline, escitalopram, aripiprazole, serotia. I’m currently on 75 mg lamictal (will add +25mg every 2 weeks) and haven’t seen much of a difference. I can’t say nagkulang ako with the work because I’ve done everything in my power for me to have a good life. And kahit wala akong emotional support I’ve sought mental health professionals and even spent a lot of time doing my own research. I have PTSD and just got diagnosed with BorderlinePD. I haven’t started DBT yet because I’m currently on a tight budget until January 2024.

I don’t think I can spend the rest of my life feeling this way. I’m really tired of trying to help myself. I’m honestly thinking if ending my life would be easier because I just don’t think it’s worth living this way. I can’t handle anyone saying life gets better because I’ve been waiting 26 years for life to get better, it hasn’t. I’ve never had a happy moment. I’ve went through physical and emotional abuse, sexual assault, neglect of basic necessities when I was a kid, and spent my teens and early 20s just working to survive. I’ve handled all of this alone. I’m sure I’m a strong person, but I just can’t take anymore of this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/17lu0h7/have_you_ever_thought_that_therapy_would_fix/,t2_ay3xacwt,1698894102.0
I slapped my girlfriend. I need help.,"A little backstory to give context to my situation. This is not an excuse. I know I need help. This back story is just for context. 

TLDR: I slapped my girlfriend many times after she reminded me of being sexually assaulted and I feel so fucking terrible. I need professional help for controlling my anger management issues.

—

I have a girlfriend. We are both girls. We’ve been together for 3 years and 4 months. Shortly after we became official, I lied to her about my whereabouts because she didn’t like the people I was gonna meet. I didn’t like them either but I’ve already committed to going so I went. 

The people I was gonna meet were my highschool friends. Long story short, I sort of have an “utang na loob” that’s why I couldnt decline when they told me to treat them for my late birthday celebration. We drank and I had a bit too much and next thing I know, someone was behind me taking off my jeans. I don’t remember all the details, except that something terrible happened to me that night. I only confided about it to just one friend.

Four months later, my girlfriend was going through my phone and found out about it. She was angry, understandably. But I didn’t want to talk about it. I couldn’t bring myself to relive that trauma. I thought we were going to break up. But we didn’t. We stayed together. 

Fast forward to present, my girlfriend and I were drinking. Then we had a misunderstanding. She went to her room and I didn’t bother following. She’s drunk so I figured I’ll talk to her the day after when she’s sober. I was gonna sleep in the living room. 

After some time, she went out of her room and approached me, saying, “Hey, remember when you cheated on me?” I was confused and thought she was just joking. I asked, “wdym?” Then she brought that unfortunate event up. And I was like, “what? How is that cheating? How is being r*ped/sexually assaulted cheating?” 

She says it is cheating because I lied about where I was that day. She went back to her room and I followed angrily asking why would she want to remind me that night and make me relive the trauma. I asked what her point was. She said she never got over it because we never talked about it. I explained that I wasn’t ready to talk about it, that I tried so hard to forget it and that I didn’t want to remember any of it. I explained over and over but she just didn’t care. So I lost it. I slapped her, twice. Then she went as far as saying I went to my highschool friends willingly to get fucked. So I slapped her again. I didn’t know what happened to me. I’ve always known I had anger management issues. But I never laid my hands on her or anyone like that. I never slapped anyone that hard. 

After that, she told me to leave. She didn’t really have to. I was gonna leave. I was ashamed of what I did. 

I initially thought what I did was okay because she was provoking me and practically victim-blaming me for getting sexually assaulted. But that’s not an excuse. I physically abused her. It didn’t matter what’s the reason why I did it. I slapped my girlfriend and I feel like the most terrible person in the world. I immediately knew after that that there is no going back. I love her. I spent the last three years and 4 months of my life dedicating myself to her. We can’t be together anymore. She was emotionally abusing me and I ended up physically abusing her. The relationship was getting toxic. This is the end for us. 

I need help. I don’t know where to start or who to ask. I get mad often that I don’t know how to control it anymore. I don’t want to keep being like this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/uag5nf/i_slapped_my_girlfriend_i_need_help/,t2_cje6e14u,1650751970.0
About my SA,"Please help me figure out.i reposted here for help

 so it happened when I was 11 or 12  . My uncle(mother's brother) started being weird to me. He started slapping my butt and touching them (he never used to do that before). So one day while I was helping my mother in kitchen , he called me asked me to give him a hug. So I gave him a hug, the hug was unusually long and before I knew , he started putting his hand inside my top and started grabbing my breast and rubbing them. I got really sacred and I froze. I was scared and I didnt know what to do. After some time I  told him that I have to go to kitchen and complete my job . I  tried to run away  from him but he grabbed me and said that I should stay with him and hug him. I made some excuse and ran away to kitchen . Idk what happened after that. I thought that this is how adults teach us good touch and bad touch. The next time when he visited me , he touched my butt. I knew that it was bad,  but I swear I  never knew the seriousness.  I started avoiding him and keeping my distance from him ( I got scolded from my parents for that). When I turned 14 I realized that it was sexual abuse. I was heartbroken because I used to see him as a father figure. After that I'm scared of older men. I started self harming the same year and my school counselor found out it. . My school counselor talked to my parents about the issue . They didn't believe me at first. Well my mother have made pretty  bad remarks about it when we fought about him .I swear I love her  and she is a good person but I can't forgive her for saying all those horrible things about me just because she didn't want to believethat jer brother was a asshole .  I went to therapy for 3 months . Well after that I got better. I no longer self harm myself like before. But at times when I suddenly get anxiety for no reason I harm myself . Idk y but I suddenly get paniced and get scared for no reason. The sudden wave of anxiety just makes it hard for me. My hands shake and at that time I get a tendency to harm myself. I adjust this feeling by scratching or pinching myself or slapping myself on cheeks . I'm still unsure about living . I feel guilty that I can't  imagine my future.  I feel so worthless . Tbh I don't  even care about living . Idk there are more part of trauma that I don't remember. My memory is foggy and I don't even remember if it happened when I was 11 or 12. I used to wonder if I made this all up but somewhere in my heart ik that it happened. Please help me figure out what's going on with me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/15mky5z/about_my_sa/,t2_kp9s698w,1691600436.0
my family is so unfair and it’s making me depressed,"I just want to rant on here because to be honest I don’t have someone to vent these feelings with. Since the pandemic up until now, my family has been heavily relying on me with everything. They even forced me to have a job after graduating high schoo. Now I initially didn’t have a problem with this because I genuinely want to help them even though hindi na ako nakaproceed ng college. Like I said I was okay with it, but when I had a problem with my job because I was mistreated and sexually harassed by my coworkers for being trans, I quit. Now with my savings I tried going back to school but I also applied for a scholarship and I passed so I thought everything was going better. Fast forward now, the school year ended. We had another crisis and I had to stop school. I was thinking of getting a WFH job because I live in a small city and we barely have opportunities. It was not easy for me to find a remote job because I really don’t have the skills for it or maybe I have but it’s only limited so I was getting depressed. Now my mom is getting agitated kasi daw I didn’t find any opportunities and mind you I have to fund for my laptop that I was going to use. She kept guilt tripping me to earn more money even though I am contributing half the bills with my side hustles online and this maybe isnt that bad if I didn’t have a 24 year old brother who doesn’t do anything but play computer games on his pc 24/7 and doesn’t even help with chores or anything like that, verbally abusive pa to me and my mom, but the confusing thing was she kept defending him like he was angel even though he does nothing but abuse us and our resources. He’s also very demanding with the food and everything else but she kept defending him but gets mad at me for every little thing. I’m so sick of it and I don’t know what to do and I can’t escape them or else they’ll call me selfish or possibly disown me and I don’t have a family. It’s just so unfair lang cause she also defended my sister who got pregnant nung teenager palang siya and she was even spoiled cause we were at a good place financially at the time. Yet she acts like she’s also an angel even though my sister stole our appliances and lied about something to get money from my parents just to go to Siargao with her boyfriend and bragged about it on social media, but when she had a problem with her kidneys, my parents were so quick to sell our car and everything else but yes she didn’t do anything wrong and that she’s an angel. She’s 26 now and I’m thr youngest in the family (21). This is so mentally draining and to be honest I already attempted to off myself but I managed to stop. I just want others opinion about this and how can I make my situation better. I feel so lost and exhausted. It’s getting very painful. I might give up soon…I have nowhere to go and I can’t trust anyone",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/16e7xcx/my_family_is_so_unfair_and_its_making_me_depressed/,t2_vklkhq01,1694271773.0
Maglalayas ako.,"I'm in need of serious advice ng mga kailangan kong gawin at mga dapat ko tandaan. Huwag niyo na sanang subukang baguhin isip ko, salamat.

Reason:

Matagal ko nang pinagiisipan 'to, ilang buwan na rin halos kaya ilalagay ko lahat ng reason.
Nakatira ako ngayon kasama ang mommy ko and second husband nya. Magkakasama rin kami rito ng mga kapatid ko at mga anak niya with the second husband. Everything would seem fine if pipilitin nating huwag pagtuunan ng pansin na I was sexually assaulted by my step-father months ago, my mother knew yet wala siyang ginawa kundi igaslight ako na i was just being sensitive, and it's my fault daw because I sleep nang nakasando at shorts lang, (I have my own room and ang ginawa ng stepdad ko eh pinapasok ako sa kuwarro habang tulog at hinihipuan ako.) 
Also, my mom and stepdad is physically and verbally abusive. There were days were they would punch in the face, bang her head sa pader, and choke my older sister (with severe autism) with pillow while telling her na they want to kill her for doing something not very 'normal' for them.
Hindi ko sila ma expose kasi may pagkapavictim silang dalawa at napakamanipulative. 

 they both verbally abused me together with my younger brother na disabled (no read no write, cant walk, partly blind, cant speak) my mom would tell us that she's cursed, and that she hopes di nalang kami naging anak niya. 



Today's the last straw: my mom got mad at my older sister for cussing so she decided to beat her up again for hours to the point that my sister were begging her to stop. After non, pinalayas niya yung older sister ko (ngayon na nasa lola ko na) 



I've always been patient with them kasi wala na akong mapuntahan, my biological father does the same thing to us kaya di namin siya pwedeng lapitan. Yung lola ko naman eh walang pera para tustusan kami. Nagaaral ako kaya natagalan bago ako nakapagdecide ng ganito kasi gusto ko magtapos para makuha ko mga kapatid ko kaso hindi ko na kayang intindihin pa mga ginagawa nila samin. Laging tinatry kong isipin na kaya ganyan si mama kasi very abusive din ang tatay niya pero I can only understand so much, I can only be patient for a while. 

Mayroon naman akong ipon, iniisip ko lang paano na pagaaral, anong trabaho papasukin at pano ako makakausad nang hindi ako babalik sa bahay na to unless when it's time for me to get my brother na.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/jc7zr5/maglalayas_ako/,t2_8i3wfu83,1602847003.0
Trauma from past relationship,"**TW: S\*xual abuse** 

**Disclaimer:** LONG POST AHEAD!! I decided to post my story here to seek advice or idk be one of the sorts of strength for people na kapareho ng pinagdadaanan ko.  I don't want to vent this to my friends since this topic is sensitive.

I can say that I had a good childhood even though my parents separated. My needs and wants were given to me. When I reached my teenage years, my Mom and I would have discussions about love, relationships, and finding the ideal partner. Growing up, I also learned from the experiences of other people and I swore to never let myself in those abusive relationships - or so I thought.

During my freshman in college, I met a guy who is really attractive and I developed a huge crush on him. It didn't take that long for him to notice me as we were introduced by my friend who is actually his cousin. He took an interest in me and he courted me. I was over the moon as I once again experienced love from someone. I recently just moved on from my ex who btw was also my childhood friend.  

During the first few months of courtship, I can say that he's a green-flag guy. He supported my K-pop obsession and even bought me photo cards. He would always assure me and be there for me. He even helps me with my academics. It was a rare feeling that made me grow closer to him.

We would often go out on dates and I would even lie to my Mom just to be with him. His first red flag was when we were eating lunch, he touched me priv\*tes without my consent. I was shocked and speechless as this was a new feeling. I just disregarded it and let him do his thing as I do not know what to do. 

A few months passed, and he continued this ""green flag"" persona but then he would ask for sexual favors from me. I always say no and he would guilt-trip me. One time he turned violent as he was jealous of a male friend I was talking to and he suddenly slapped me. I don't know what I was thinking and why I still let him court me but I guess I was afraid to break things off with him. I was scared of losing someone I'm completely attached to and I don't want to be alone again.

December marked his one year of courtship so I decided to make our relationship official and introduce him to my family and friends. We had a Christmas concert at our university and I was planning to tell him all about it after the event. I was looking forward to it but after the concert, he texted me to break things off of us. He told me that he got back with his ex-girlfriend. I was devastated . 

A few days before Christmas, he broke up again with his ex. He texted me to talk things through and win me back but I said no as I had enough of him. We still continued to be friends and he would constantly ask either for sexual favors or for him to court me again but I would always say no. I tried to break off even our friendship as I don't deserve that kind of treatment but then I kept running back to his company as I do not want to be alone until he threatened to leak my n\*de video. First of all, I never sent anything to him but when he showed me the video, I realized that he was recording me while I was showering and changing at his and his sister's condo. 

I was once again scared and devastated as I never know when he is going to drop the bomb on me. I had no one to turn to but myself. I went to his place to ask him kindly to delete the video but he refused and slapped me once again. I tried to be brave and ask for help from his Mother, sister, and cousin. I threatened to sue him but they talked me out of it. I agreed to let it slide as long as the video is deleted in front of me. I was glad that everything was settled but the trauma is still there. I hate that I let it slide but I had no choice as I do not want to drag my parents from my mess.

I think I'm doing better now but it still haunts me to this day. I would get nightmares from it and oftentimes break down. I'm even scared that I might see him in our university. It has really affected me but I try to stay strong. What should I do? Do you think I need therapy? Can I really get through this? If I needed therapy, I don't know how to finance it without letting my parents know. Please be kind with your comments.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/14a0iv4/trauma_from_past_relationship/,t2_ud8r60c9,1686830256.0

I'm almost flipping out,"I am 30M. I will tell you about my story briefly. I grew up in an environment full of women. My parents were together, but you know on paper only. I have a father who loves me so much, and he has been physically there with me, but he left my mother with all the responsibilities and emotional needs that should have been a guide for a son and he lived his own life.

I have always been bullied by boys around me just because I had not been swearing, not speaking inappropriately about girls, or objectifying them. They considered me gay, incomplete, or ""less than a man"". I suffered a long period of abuse in childhood. When I started middle school, I was in a relationship with the most beautiful girl in the school and we stayed in a relationship for 2.5 years, but even then I kept hearing all those insults. At some point, I started to question if they might be right, why I couldn't convince them, and why I couldn't be a ""real man"", just like one of them.

My perspective shifted and I went into a great darkness, I had no idea who I was anymore and I lived almost my whole life in this darkness. I had girlfriends, and I had long-lasting relationships, but I was never able to surrender to a woman, I never let myself go, I never allowed myself to let anyone love me, and I never allowed myself to really love anyone.

On the other hand, I lived my whole life observing the other men around me. On streets, on a bus, in the sauna or gym, etc. Those men became an object for me and I started to compare myself with them by seeing their more masculine side than mine such as being hairier, having sharper features, being more muscular, having a bigger penis, appearing more fearless, having more possessive attitudes, and so on... So, I started to humiliate myself and believe me, this humiliation started to give me pleasure somehow. I was trapped in a cycle where I created situations to humiliate myself and then I suffered.

Then something happened. I met a man 2.5 years ago and he was exactly the perfect example of the object of my self-abasement. But things turned out the way I didn't expect. He didn't humiliate me, he didn't belittle me, he didn't harass me, he wasn't rude to me. He saw me, my inner pain, he showed me his own wounds. He was there for me, he supported me when I cried.

Here's what I can't figure out right now. That man has been so good to me that I have become so attached to him, I can say that I'm co-dependent now. I don't want to live without him, I want to go with him wherever he goes, I want to do what he does. We have been spending so much time together for the last 2.5 years. He has become the center of my life. It's kind of a bromance-like relationship or sometimes I call it ""philia"", he is straight and he is not a sexual object for me, BUT I'm so confused. I really have a hard time understanding if I'm in love with this man, if I'm really gay, or if something else is going on, like after all these years of experience, I was shocked to meet such a person or something.

I have been in therapy for 2.5 years. EMDR has helped me a lot to get rid of my childhood traumas, but unfortunately, I feel too frozen to move now. Where have all my emotions gone, where are my sexual urges, where have my positive emotions gone, who am I, what do I want? I am completely in the unknown and my depression is getting deeper and deeper each day.

I really need someone to talk to me, even if you can't offer a solution. I want to hear something.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/17prlq9/im_almost_flipping_out/,t2_ncugab1vv,1699354110.0
Lost,"Sobrang mentally at emotionally draining mag-stay sa bahay na ito kaya sana magka-face to face classes na. Nahihirapan akong makisama sa tatay kong sexually harraser, at sa nanay kong enabler at narcissist.  Naalala ko nung nagsumbong ako sa nanay ko way back 2018 when my father tried to touch me tapos wala syang ginawa kundi i-gaslight ako at sinabing paglalambing lang daw yun. She even told me not to tell my sister or anyone around me. As if, eh nakakadiri kaya. I couldn't afford to move out (until now) kasi magsstart pa lang ako sa next journey ko sa med and we all know how expensive it can be. Itong nanay ko, laging binibring-up din yung sexuality ko (I'm bi) every damn time na nag-away kami dahil sa kapatid kong in-out ako without even asking me if I was ready during college. It has been 5 years nung in-out ako and 4 years nung nangyari pero dala-dala ko pa rin sya. Tapos my mom really has the audacity to ask me why am I secretive as fuck and bakit ang init palagi ng ulo ko sa bahay??????? They're all emotionally and mentally abusive. Lol.

I haven't told anyone about it yet kasi nakakadiri and baka ano pa sabihin ng ibang tao. At least dito, anonymous ako. Valid naman yung nararamdaman ko diba? Also, hindi ko kasi sure kung dapat na ba akong magpa-therapy session.

Emotionally Immature Father Accuses the Family of Teaming Up Against Him,"At first, I thought of my father as a typical short-tempered dad. He doesn't open his mouth unless it is about his interests, or when upset about something. But as I grew older, I realized that he was simply emotionally immature.

The rest of the family would behave ourselves in the way he'd like. Mind you, all of my siblings are now college students. He doesn't like it when we leave the toilet seat closed. He doesn't like it when the bathroom floor is wet (despite having someone recently using the shower). He doesn't like it when his belongings are not within eyesight (absolutely do not hide them inside a simple cabinet). He doesn't like it when we eat using our fingers when eating fish or shrimp. He doesn't like it when the window screens are closed and he's feeling hot despite the mosquitoes that bite us at night. It also leaves the house very dusty, and we'd have to clean it a lot more.

He doesn't help us clean the house at all, and his assistance can only be needed when it's really really important. He doesn't clean his dishes nor is even bothered to leave them in the sink. But he gets upset when he needs to use the sink to brush his teeth and he sees that there are dirty dishes. He never admits his mistakes, and when we point it out, he gets really upset. But when *we* make a mistake, he makes a *huge* deal out of it.

We consistently walk on eggshells in the house just to prevent him from getting upset. He doesn't physically hurt us, but he is just utterly hard to live with. I'm not even allowed to watch things he doesn't approve of at home: LGBT shows, Filipino teleseryes, sexual or violent content, or even shows that don't make sense (he calls these shows where you don't think is for bobo), Kdramas or Japanese anime where he doesn't understand what they're speaking.

With all of these things in mind, the rest of the family is much closer to each other than to him. One time, we watched a comedy movie in the bedroom without him. My sibling was laughing so hard, and my mother told them to quiet it down because my father might hear us. You have no idea how much it hurts me. Are we not allowed to experience joy without him? and are we not allowed to simply laugh out loud despite how ""unacceptable"" he thinks the way that we laugh is?

This brings me to the reason why I wrote this post. He accuses us of teaming up against him. He gets upset because we try to console each other after his angry verbally abusive outbursts (he doesn't say profanities, but his words are still as sharp as a knife). He gets upset when we have fun activities without him. How could we not...? It's extremely hard to please him.

I just really want to let my feelings out here. Are there other people who experience family dynamics like this? If so, how do you cope?

Thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/195i00k/emotionally_immature_father_accuses_the_family_of/,t2_i33bh4me,1705128782.0

Ayoko nung course na inaral ko. Parents pumili. Kaso walang alternative. Walang ibang career options kundi yun kaya nagbreakdown and AWOL ako. Ngayon mga non-technical non-speaking roles lang kaya kong kunin kasi yun lang magaaccept sakin.

Buti na lang a few years ago, a friend referred me to a back-office night shift position he found. I tried and was accepted. Kaso after 2 years nalugi yung company and I'm out of work ulit.

This year I got a VA job. Flexi-time. Hourly based pay. 

I'm finding out how bad and triggering this role and setup is for me. Walang scope yung job, unli tasks. Pag natapos kang maaga, trabaho ka pa kundi di ka aabot sa 40hrs/week. Di pa bilang lunch time dun. Walang definition ng work hours dahil flexi time. May customer service pa na kahit non-voice naman, inaanxiety pa rin ako ng malala talaga.

Lahat ng kasama kong trainees (4 kami) nappressure ako. Mga bibo-kids. Isang proud pa kasi naka 60hrs na ng work tapos nagwork pa daw sa weekends. Yung isa naman trainee pa lang g na g na magsuggest ng overhauls sa processes, SOPs, etc. Meanwhile me, dinodoctor pa minsan timesheet ko para lang maging reasonable kinikita ko for the month. At ginagawa lang ang bare minimum. Di kukuha ng tasks unless inassign sakin at di magiinitiate ng kung ano.

Tapos may weekends minsan. My weekends that are supposed to be my time offs. Aabangan ko pa kung naka-assign pala ako o kailangan ko maging backup. Di ako makaplano ng maaga kasi di naman nila sinasabi ng maaga yung sched. 

Friends. Dati, magkita lang kami or overnight somewhere ok na ako. Parang narefresh. Kakagawa ko lang nito nung weekend and may nakaplano next weekend pero parang walang effect sa mental health ko. Ayoko pa rin mabuhay. Tapos may work pala ako sa Sat at may nagpapa-backup rin sa Sun. 

Family. Ayoko sa kanila lahat. Di na kami naguusap ng mom ko ilang taon na. Nandidiri ako sa ugali ng dad ko. Di rin sila magkabati. Araw-araw sigawan at murahan minsan may siraan rin ng gamit. PWD isang kapatid ko di nakakausap. Tapos bunso namin di naman kami close. Kailangan ko pa magmakaawa para lang bigyan niya ako ng time magrant sa kanya tungkol sa parents namin. Nasa manila siya for college ako nandito kasama ng family sa province. 

Yung extended family naman isang pinsan lang talaga ka-close ko pero busy rin siya palagi. Yung side ng dad ko puno ng magnanakaw at nanghihingi ng pera. Yung side ng nanay ko mga mayayaman. Sobrang halatang ang baba ng tingin samin. Pano, kami lang walang business sa side nila. Tita ko tinatrato kaming utusan. Yung isang tito ko, kung magalit samin parang nagagalit sa empleyado niya. Yung isang tito ko na pinaka ok sana sumakabilang buhay na nung isang taon.

Doctor/therapy. Tagal ko na naggaganito. Nagsawa na lang ako dahil ilan ang nang-ghost bigla. May isang (TW: sexual abuse) hinawakan ako inside my shirt w/o consent. Tapos nireseta pa yung ubod mahal na gamot kahit mga 15mins lang ata kami nun kasi may lecture pa daw siya sa UST. Yung iba naman di nakikinig. Naka-phone habang session namin o kaya nangiinvalidate (""marami namang may mas malalang problema diyan eh. Diba may nakakain ka pa""). Ayoko na. Wala na rin akong budget pang therapy/meds

Exercise. I do 30 mins walk and a 15 min workout almost daily. Wala pa rin changes mentally.

Pets. Sila na lang talaga kinakapitan ko pero lately wala na rin. Parang di ko na nakikita sarili kong mabuhay for them. Oo sad isipin na di sila maalagaan ng tulad ng pag alaga ko sa kanila. Pero di ko na malalaman yun pag wala na ako. Tsaka minsan nahuhuli ko sariling kong mabigat kamay o nasisigawan na sila. Lumiliit na pasensya ko sa mundo. Nagllash out ulit.

Ang tumitigil lang sakin ay yung possibility na magfail sa attempt ko. Ayokong mabuhay pa rin tapos disabled na.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/14vo79x/i_really_wanna_give_up/,t2_f5jc8opqi,1688978477.0
Sooooooo Lost on my life path,"Hello mga ka reddit. I'm a 26F full time bpo worker. Feel ko reddit lang yung way ko na makapag vent out anonymously. 

Came from a very dysfunctional family. Long story short, I have a tita na ang tawag ko ay mommy dahil since birth siya na ang nag alaga sa akin, kinda adopted setup. Kapatid siya ng biological father ko. No comms ako sa biological parents except sa isang kuya ko na anak ng biological mom with a different man.

Before nag ka anak si mommy, ako lang yung meron siya and may kaya kami. She even have a taxi business so lahat ng luho like jb birthday parties and everything na experience ko. When she had her own children, dun nag bago trato niya sakin. Nung nagkaroon siya ng partner which I used to call Daddy everything went downhill. Tho happy naman siya ng light pa. Nung pinanganak niya na yung first daughter nia dun na nagbago yung trato niya sakin. I guess I was a child na ubod ng kulit but hurtful things were said na sana hindi na lang niya ako kinuha and the way na I discovered na hindi niya ako anak is yung sinabi niya na hindi ko kapatid yung baby niya. That young me suddenly changed from a happy go lucky and pala study na bata, I lost all interest for those things. After nun, lagi na pinapatawag ng mga teachers ko sila mommy. Tuwing may meeting sa school, walang na attend ng student parent meeting, if meron man hindi si mommy. As time goes by, palala ng palala yung panunumbat niya and pambubugbog. There was even one time na nakipag laro lang ako sa school mate ko and when I went home, hinambalos niya ako ng makapal na kahoy sa leg and knee area ko which caused me to have difficulties on walking the following day. My school mate even asked me if I was ok kasi nakita pala niya paano ako nabugbog nun. Tumagal yung ganyang setup namin hanggang sa grumaduate ako ng elementary.

2nd heartbreak is Graduation Day ko, I was hoping na maybe pupunta sia but boy I was so wrong, pinakiusapan niya yung bantay ng sari sari store namin na samahan ko sa graduation ko. Inintindi ko na lng din na mas priority nia ung business nia. During that, I can't help it but I cried nung may segment where students will approach their parents kasi inggit na inggit at the same time sobrang lungkot ko kasi I felt so alone that time. Same scenario din nung ALS Graduation ko hindi rin sia pumunta pero bestfriend ko ang sumama sakin which I was really grateful for her.

When I was in college, nagkaroon ng incident na I got sexually harassed and molested none other than the person whom I trusted and tinuring kong father figure which was her partner. Nung nagsumbong ako kay MOMMY, I already expected her reaction na hindi siya maniniwala na kayang gawin yun ng partner niya kasi all this time ang nakikita niya sakin is nothing but a good for nothing liar. That was my 3rd heartbreak na kung sino pa ang kamag anak ko siya pa ang hindi maniniwala. That incident still haunts me up until this day and might be the main cause of me developing Bipolar Disorder with Anxiety and Post Traumatic Disorder. Clinically diagnosed.

Ngayong 26 na ako, even ganun nangyari sakin di ko magawang iwanan si mommy and ang mga kinilala kong kapatid which is mga anak niya na pinsan ko. Up to this day never pa din nawawala panunumbat niya everytime na may bad day siya. I had several scde attempts before because of being verbally abused and everytime na nag brebreak down ako. All I want now is to help my 2 cousins na makatapos ng studies nila. Tinitiis ko na lang lahat ng masasakit na sumbat ng mom nila because I love those two as my own sibs.

Right now mga ka reddit, I'm so lost na hindi ko alam ano bang purpose ko. Hindi ko alam if lalaban pa ba ako. I may sound a cry baby pero pagod na pagod na ako. Everytime na mag brebreak down ako di lang siya masakit emotionally buong katawan ko sumasakit. Maybe meron kayong mashashare na tips how to fight this?. Sessions with my psychiatrist is only helping a little but nothing more than that",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/153ph5z/sooooooo_lost_on_my_life_path/,t2_h0ayahq7,1689756942.0
I'm the one who got frustrated with my Psychiatrists/Psychologists. A more detailed post on why,"I posted the thread below a day ago and some might assume I only had 1 session with these mental health professionals. I had my first session last January 2022, and the longest I've been with a mental health professional is 8 months, no improvement. I'd like to share my experience with past MH professionals and why I'm so damn frustrated. I don't really care if no one reads this but I feel like I need to vent.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/17azil2/why\_do\_ph\_psychiatristspsychologists\_instantly/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/17azil2/why_do_ph_psychiatristspsychologists_instantly/)

Psychologist 1 - *4 sessions for almost 2 months*

* I think this is the only psychologist in the province I lived in before (or the only one I could search anyway). Lots of red flags in the first meeting. I told her I was agnostic and she told me she understands but hopes I would see that a god exists. Asked my salary and told me to invest it in the place she was investing her money (won't mention where). I didn't say my true salary and straight up wanted to leave. Told me to definitely not take medication. The last straw was when I told her I was sexually assaulted as a kid and she told me I was still lucky I wasn't r4ped. That that must be why I was stable(??) because I wasn't r4ped. Told her that's not luck, that should be the norm. And thinking that way is enabling the future generation to normalize r4pe. I didn't go to another psychologist until a year later because I was afraid all psychologists were like that but it was probably just the culture in my province where everyone has no boundaries and imposes their religious beliefs on a daily basis. I shouldn't have expected a lot for 500php/hr anyway.

Psychologist 2 - *Probably 5 sessions over the course of a few months. I forgot because I wasn't the consistent*

* Online consultations. Kind of liked her but there were times I didn't (I think those were the times I was splitting. Should have been a sign I had BorderlinePD). I just remembered she was the one who told me to consider if I had bipolar disorder. Didn't go back because I felt F2F consults were better because I was already at my apartment 24/7 (I WFH).

Psychiatrist 1 - *8 months. Once or twice a month*

* Initally diagnosed me with MDD and PTSD (I agree with the PTSD). I waited for the meds to take effect for months but constantly said I didn't feel anything changing. I told my family history (bio dad is diagnosed psychopath, grandfather has hallucinations and paranoia relating to hallucinations and is also violent, half-sister is neurodivergent. they never got any medical help btw even with those diagnosis) but was not diagnosed with anything else. I also told her I had violent tendencies (when I was alone) like thrashing my stuff and daydreamed about ways to harm people and how they could die (this was for people who've harmed me. I acknowledge that's not a good reason to wish ill of them). I get angry at the smallest things and would cut people off when they said one thing I didn't like. This was true even on meds. I also said a whole host of symptoms that I now know are symptoms of BorderlinePD but I don't think she took me seriously. She prescribed me a medication (still for MDD I think) that she said was addictive and I said that might be a problem because I have substance abuse issues. She told me to just control my dosage. That's not how addiction works. There were times where nagchchika nalang siya sa sessions about things I think didn't relate to my mental health anymore. Treatment plan never changed even though I constantly said I still feel the same. Just upped my dosage to the max possible for MDD. After 8 months, I didn't think I could spend any more money with no improvement. I don't think she's a bad psych but I guess just not the right fit for me and my mental disorders. I just stopped my meds cold turkey and didn't feel any changes or withdrawal symptoms, so I can probably say it didn't have any effect on me.

Psychiatrist 2 - *1 session*

* Prescribed valproic acid which aggregates PCOS and alters thyroid function. Asked if I should get myself checked first because I didn't know if I had PCOS or abnormal thyroid hormone levels and had no way to know about family's medical history but she just said to not worry lalo na I'm still young. I still got myself checked and just didn't go back kasi I wanted F2F na.

Psychiatrist 3 - *Will have my 2nd session this week.*

Now, I've looked forward to getting mental help as early as elementary. I spent a few years living in a domestically violent household, and spent the next decade living in between relatives who weren't physically abusive, but were verbally abusive and neglected me to the point where a lot of times I didn't have food and no one took care of me when I got sick (no meds, no food). I self-supported myself to finish college so finances have always been tight. A lot of times I wanted to kill myself. A lot of times I hurt myself. I stuck it out because I always told myself everything would be better once I'm financially stable and able to get help. I spent the first few years working multiple part-time jobs on top of my full-time job to save up. I was really excited to finally get some mental health help and now I'm just frustrated I'm not making any progress. I've finally got some sort of financial stability (the thing I said would make me happy) and I just feel nothing. Everything that happened to me finally caught up to me and I'm feeling the anger, sadness and resentment all at once. I don't have constant emotional support so I was betting my life on psychotherapy and meds saving me. I do try to function every day. I work, go to the gym, try to eat right, pay my bills on time, etc. I struggle to get up every day, but I do try. But when I don't have work I just cry and binge eat and think about dying. I'm 26 now, but I feel like I've lived 50 years. I don't think I can live the rest of my life like this.

I think I'll be booking a session with Doc Mariano. She's out of my price range but I heard she's the best. And I think I need the best for me to even have a shot at getting better.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/17c3fa2/im_the_one_who_got_frustrated_with_my/,t2_l0bssk5da,1697778650.0
Undiagnosed.,"[I'm 15 and I badly want to have an access to a mental health professional since I've been extremely related with every symptom/sign, in the likes of BPD and ADHD comorbidity, but I don't know how I will have.]


I prefer to keep my name private. Call me Paul.

Lumaki ako sa Lolo at Lola ko, my mother gave birth at me at the age of nineteen, she didn't finished her first college course because of the pregnancy. 11 months after I was born, I had a brother and they have to give me to my grandparents since they really are not that economically and mentally stable at that time and my grandparents live in such an above stable living.

I have been there for nine years, it was a conservative household, and I was eight when I discovered I'm not a straight boy. I have always hidden it, my queer identity has always been suppressed inside. For 5 years, I studied in a Christian school which caused me to suppress my sexuality more. There were jokes of disownments kasi rin, kaya sobrang natakot ako.

When I came back to my parents at the age of ten, my Mom already finished her college and has been practice teaching (her course is Education). I was so naïve, 'di ko alam kung anong ieexpect ko sa mga magulang ko, since hindi naman kami ganoon ka-close.

That's when I've experienced kung paano yung feeling ng na sa laylayan. We lived in an impoverished community, squatter ba kung tawagin. At that time, dalawa na yung nakababata kong kapatid.

It was a violent and extreme household, mom knew I was gay, and she really doesn't care, my Dad too, except that he always use his ""tolerance"" against me.

Linggo-linggo, palaging away, not only verbally but also physically. I think it was 2016, where it really peaked, yung violence sa household, yung pisikalan, yung siraan ng gamit sa bahay, basagan ng plato, baliktarin ng mesa sa hapag, and even pagbabato ng mga gamit at damit sa labas ng bahay. The anger issues of my father made my Mom emotionally dismissive and extreme to us as well. At that time, yung laging na sa isip ko, paano nakakayanan ng nanay ko yung ganoon. Not only the abuse, but the quality of life that our father has given to us. Linggo-linggo mangungutang sa kapitbahay, sa mga kamag-anak, tsismis doon, tsismis dito.

It was a very extreme environment, na I wasn't even able to pity myself anymore, but to pity my two younger brothers and a year after that, our youngest brother was born. He also got to somehow, shortly sought the unhealthiness of our family.

Last year, my Mom and Dad separated, because my Mom's family urged her to let go of the 16-year old toxic relationship they had, since it got to a point where there have been death threats and threats of our personal things getting destroyed and thrown.

After that, my grandfather disowned me as well because of finally outing myself as a queer.

From Mandaluyong, we transferred to Tarlac.

My Mom is still now a teacher in Mandaluyong, since it's really not an easy least process to transfer, but I'm really glad that we have been in an economically stable place now, a thing that we didn't have when we were our father.

I'm currently taking care of my brother full-time, until face-to-face classes go back, and it's very mentally tiring as well.

Since hindi naman sila kasal, the conjugation was never addressed properly.

Four months ago, we found out that my five-year old brother has an ADHD.

I don't really know if it is because of the environment we had, but he's yet to have his therapy.

Maybe what I'm experiencing right now is a traumatic response, since I assure you that everything was just so mentally scarring. The gaslight, abuse and narcissism I have been fazed into was never great.

Every day is emotionally painful, draining, and so hard to cope, there's this constant fear of abandonment, impulsive (sexual) behaviors, self-harm, the inability to build up stable relationships and friendships, violent mood swings and a never-ending struggle with self-image.

Me and my brother share absolute the same page when it comes to inability to focus and be firm and stable,.and to habe extreme racing thoughts, differing that I just have violent and detrimental ones.

Even though we're in an economically stable place now, my mind still re-operates in my past.

Suicidal ideation has been a part of the everyday struggle.

If you get here, thank you so much for listening to me, I appreciate you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/vta8s3/undiagnosed/,t2_h141jzgk,1657169397.0
I [F26] think my mother [F52] is a narcissist,"I recently got my diagnosis for autism and, last year, for ADHD. I'm taking three medications at the moment. One for depression, one for my anxiety and one for my ADHD. I am also planning to go to therapy for my ASD.

Ever since, as long as I can remember, my mom demanded so much of me. Kasalanan ko kasi maipanganak, so I have to pay the price by becoming great. I was given all the opportunities that my parents weren't able to receive when they were younger (proper education, full meals, decent clothing, complete books and school supplies, pocket money, etc.), so they expected that I could achieve far greater heights. Kaso ayun nga, I didn't.

I was *not putting all the deets bec very triggering basta very chaotic and self damaging*.

I fought my way to where I am right now in my mental health. My father has been reluctant at first pero super supportive and understanding na siya ngayon. I can see him doing his best talaga even if he had his shortcomings in the past from how he behaved.

Pero my mom.......

It's like she takes all the opportunities talaga to use my weaknesses against me. Lagi niya sinasabi ""bakit ako, kami ng mga kapatid ko, wala naman kaming gamot pero okay naman kami."" Which is false btw, she and all of her siblings have difficulty addressing their concerns due to how they were raised by my lolo.

Her favorite one so far is ""walang magtatagal sa'yo, lahat ng tao iiwan ka.""

She just knows how to hit me hard eh. I had a long term ex boyfriend who I had an on and off relationship for eight years and she knew kasi na lagi ako iniiwan.

Other signs din eh nakikita ko like she has one sided view of everything. Kapag may mali any person in our family, no matter what the reason kahit valid, hindi niya kaya magextend ng understanding. Pero kapag siya nagkamali, kailangan nagets na namin kaagad na tao siya.

Lahat utang na loob pa sa kanya. Number 1 red flag sa amin ng kapatid ko ever since childhood yung kunwari ""ililibre"" niya daw kami pero ibabawas na pala sa allowance namin na binibigay ng tatay namin. Which is btw enough lang ha kasama na yung mga biglaang projects doon. Pero nababawasan pa dahil sa kanya dati. I just learned overtime na wag na maniwala sa kanya.

Tapos ang hilig niya sa ""bakit ako +insert something na worse nangyari sa kanya pero hindi siya naging ganon"" whenever may tao pinaguusapan na dumaan sa something at naging for example slut, drug addict, etc.

Lagi din siya naooffend kapag magbibigay siya advice tapos di namin susundin. Naooffend din siya kapag may susuotin kami na ayaw niya yung style (pahirapan pa para masunod yung gusto namin).

Hilig din niya daanin sa physical abuse kapag nagmemake sense mga sinasabi namin. Lalo na nung bata ako. Ngayon kasi kaya ko na tumakbo at makaalis. Nung bata ako, literal na bata ako.

Tapos kapag nagoopen up siya kailangan pakinggan ko siya. Kapag di ko siya pinakinggan magtethreat siya na sige hindi na daw siya magoopen up.

Tapos pinaka malala dati yung inakusahan ako ng sarili kong nanay na- (gusto ko sana iopen up dito kaso masyadong below the belt, basta sexual and incest thing) dahil lang nagbibigay sa akin tatay ko ng allowance directly. Hindi na dinadaan sa kanya kasi financially manipulative siya :((

Ang dami pa, eh. The list goes on. Wala pa diyan yung public humiliation na hilig niya gawin sa amin.

Ayun lang. Nahihirapan lang talaga ako. Naiiyak nalang ako kasi need ko talaga help pero yung mom ko, feel ko hindi ako maghiheal kapag nasa iisang lugar ako kung nasaan siya :((",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/17w2mt8/i_f26_think_my_mother_f52_is_a_narcissist/,t2_ksq1i4a2,1700079420.0
Spouse’s Paranoia Need Help,"I need help. I have been with my husband going on 12 years. This is our first year married. We have one son (3) and a second child on the way. Basically I know him pretty well so i know when something isn’t right. I initially noticed it during Covid. He is African American, while being stuck inside because of Covid and the racially tension in the community growing he would get more and more anxious around big crowds/police etc. Covid eased up and when it was time to go back to work things seemed fine. He is a high school football coach so he dived into work. His team ended up winning the state championship. During the season he would say some concerning things ex: he thought people were recording their practices, stealing plays and thought reporters were against him. All of this I just chalked up to him being very stressed, he wasn’t sleeping a lot and so consumed with work on top of a newborn. We then went away to Mexico for our destination wedding. He had started a super low dose of anxiety meds before we left. We almost didn’t get married because he started to accuse my dad and cousin of spying on him, following him around on this trip. He was super paranoid. I again let it go thinking he was on new meds, stressed about getting married, and drinking a lot on this trip. Some small paranoid situations continued but started to get really bad during the next football season. He claimed kids on his team were wearing wires. That cars were following him. When he would occasionally smoke weed it seemed to be worse. He would wake me up in the middle of the night saying the police were coming for him but couldn’t explain to me why he thought that. I got him to admit he was struggling and called a mental health facility. Once they said he would have to go away for 30 days and could have visitors under 18 he decided not to go because he couldn’t see his son. We talked about him needing to at least go see a therapist regularly but it didnt happen. Now he can’t leave the house without fully being convinced he is being followed. He worked at a middle school briefly and mistakenly glanced at a child’s back side. He immediately quit and said he thinks the school is investigating him for being a sexual predator. Mind you he just recently found out that as a young child he might have been abused. He thinks the police are planting people around him to catch him doing something. He found a new job and claimed that everyone at the training was a plant trying to get him. He says he also thinks his phone is tapped. I’m just at a loss of what to do. I am pregnant trying to work and raise a toddler and everyday it’s a struggle. I try not to accuse him of having mental health issues and just try to listen but it’s so hard. He now refuses to go talk to a therapist because he thinks they will use what he says to get him in trouble. If anyone has advice for me please help.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/13q66f0/spouses_paranoia_need_help/,t2_bx5b98cw0,1684888979.0
I have PTSD and depression and graduated cum laude," \[TW: Sexual harassment/rape, suicide\]

I am diagnosed with PTSD and Persistent Depressive Disorder.

I find it difficult to start since most people would be surprised when I tell them this. How did I, the loud, jolly, and smiling classmate, had these diagnoses? I had everything I needed: I grew up with my family, lived a comfortable life, studied in a prestigious school, and achieved high marks. All I had to do was go to school and study, right?

When I was in elementary, I experienced sexual harassment which caused my trauma. The details will not be shared for my privacy, but people often think that after a traumatic experience, everything becomes okay again, right? For the abuser, it was just an ordinary day. For other people, it is just a small sin that can be easily forgotten (“forgive and forget”). But for the victim, we would always remember. Our body holds their sins and it weighs us down.

My childhood flew by and before I knew it, I was in high school. I was aware of my past, and it did hurt, but I tried my best to move on. That’s what everybody says, right? Just move on.

But what people don’t know is how we experience our trauma and grief. They don’t know the times we asked ourselves what we did wrong - what did I, a five-year-old at that time, do? People don’t understand how much we blame ourselves and how difficult it is to speak up and how to forget everything because everything is overwhelming everything keeps moving so fast fast fast and we have to smile we can’t speak about it people don’t believe us we have to be okay we have to move on we have to move move move. 

And so, I tried. I went to school everyday, did my homework diligently, and remained a loving daughter. I took care of my physical health by minding my nutrition, working out, and even doing yoga. On the outside, really, everyone could see how I had an easy life.

I hope you never get to experience 10:00PM in your room feeling afraid, feeling the closing of your throat, feeling dizzy and afraid and nervous and scared because you know you’re safe in your house but you don’t feel because you feel hand hands hands touching you. You feel and see and remember the event happening again and again he’s here he’s touching you and I can’t do anything I scrub my body and wash my body but I still feel his hands imprinted on me. So I cry in silence and hope the pain will go away, and yet it never does. Praying didn’t make it go away. Smiling didn’t make it go away. Studying didn’t make it go away. 

It was particularly difficult during the pandemic because I spent my days in our house, seeing the same four walls for two years. The nightmares got worse and repeated again and again the fear remained and sometimes would leave but would come right back. I don’t understand why does it hurt why does it hurt WHY DOES IT STILL HURT I AM 21 YEARS OLD AND IT HAPPENED WHEN I WAS 5 WHY DOES IT MATTER I didn’t understand I was so lost, afraid, week, and sad. I still see it I still feel it I feel so afraid, so small, so sad. Why am I not happy why does it still hurt why am I like this? During panic attacks my hands were numb, my brain heavy and dizzy, I was smiling and laughing with other people but my chest hurt, my chest feels heavy, my hands are shaking, I feel my heart palpitate but I smile and I nod. Ultimately, the pain was too much to bear. The flashbacks and fear were so intense that I wanted to overdose and just sleep so I won’t feel it again. When I was in my third year, just before laboratory and clinicals, I was hospitalized because of a suicide attempt of overdosing my dormmate's sleeping pills

I asked for help. It was the first time my parents and brother knew what I was going through. It felt new telling other people my experience. It was my first time when I didn’t need to hide the nightmares, the flashbacks, and panic attacks. I remember how difficult it was for me to see my family cry, especially to see how Mama sobbed and wished she could carry my pain. It was also difficult to get used to the side effects of the medications. It took months of medications and therapy to process my trauma. 

Don't get me wrong: I still have flashbacks. I still cry. I am still on medications and therapy. But I also graduated as a cum laude. I had a scholarship for the review center I was looking at. I am preparing for boards. And I am actually in love with living. Sure, there are times when I feel heavy and depressed, but there are also brighter days - lighter days when I can really smile.

I hope that our generation will know that mental health is important, and people with mental illnesses can achieve their dreams. I want people to know that I am depressed and I made it. I had a serious mental illness and I graduated as a cum laude. To you, who are reading this, who doubt yourself, and who have experienced these as well, it is still possible to dream. Yes, you are depressed, you are a victim, but you are so much more than that.

Mental health is a serious issue. I encourage everyone to support their family members and friends who are going through a rough time.

If you are looking for a sign, this is your sign. You matter. You deserve to be in this world. Seek help, especially professional help to process the things that bring you down. It is okay to feel pain. It is okay to feel sad. You are still worthy. Time will tell how amazing you will be.

You deserve to be alive. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/15pu2qb/i_have_ptsd_and_depression_and_graduated_cum_laude/,t2_3srzd7vc,1691917605.0
Sharing my thoughts," Im Taylor, 32, M (not straight) and struggling in every aspect of my life. Lately I feel like I have been swimming in a lot of pain and misery.

I have a lot of unhealed trauma that I needed to resolve, a lot of pain from the past that seems to always want to resurface and it hurts every time. While talking to my Psychiatrist, she mentioned that the reason I was looking certain qualities is because I was denied of it as a child. Taking a trip down memory lane, it made me realize that of everything, I wanted to feel wanted and I want to feel SAFE. I have a lovely mother but I just realized that most of my emotional scars were from her, from the words that can longer be taken back. I dont blame her for that. I love her with all my heart, I dont hate her nor blame her for I know that she's just a victim as well. I felt abandoned as a child but I harbor no hate nor blame her, but rather I am thankful for I know that she did everything that she could for me and for her family. She is one of the most loving person I know and she has an enroumous heart and capacity for love. There are a lot of things that I have come to realize, I fear abandonment I dont like the feeling of being left behind, its much to painful for me, its as if all the pain from my childhood whenever I would come home with my mother leaving me so she could work has been as fresh as if it only happened today. I didnt know what it was called back then but now, I am most certain that as a child I Have already been very depressed as I remember wondering why I was even alive and what was my purpose and I was in elemeentary that time. I was also looking for a father figure. I grew up without a father which had me wondering what it was like growing up with one. My Uncle, my aunt's husband was that until he sexually abused me. I was around 4 years old when that happened if I recall it right. Back in the province, we had a common restroom where the 2 families would share and its outside the house. I looked up to him and he was dear to me, that time, I didnt know what was what so I just agreed to whatever he wanted. I cried from the pain but I was a silent cryer ever since I was a child. I was told not to tell anyone, and just as I was told, I never did. I only told my mother when I was 20, when she was forcing me to go back to the province. I only said that because I did not want to go back, I just used it as an excuse. I dont harbor any hatred towards him as well but its just unfortunate that things turned out how it did, it really fucked me in the head really bad. I know things happen for a reason no matter how bad it could be. That one fateful night made too great of an impact to my life that if I can turn back time, I would change it. Im part of the rainbow most likely because of what happened back then and Im certain of it as what I have discovered talking to some of the peers - SA plays a big part in this. Its really hard for us in this community finding love as I know deep inside, its only either they wanted something or that true love for me doesnt exist because it the relationship is not really meant to last. I know most can relate to this, if I were straight, I could get married, have kids and a family of my own. But who knows? Im not ashamed of what I am but Im really struggling and its really hard.   


Writing this, three words kept coming up in my head. Fear of Abandonment, Wanting to feel SAFE and BETRAYAL of TRUST. As the time goes by, Ill write all my thoughts to let it materialize outside of my head hoping that by letting so, somehow I can ease the pain that I am feeling and somehow I can let it go, even if it means a trickle out of the Ocean of pain and suffering that I have been carrying my whole life.   


The wreck that I am now is now bleeding on to the rest of my life, I know that its already affected my finances, my job, my personal relationship, my family, my relationship with myself. I know for a fact, I need to forgive myself for the things I did in the past. For the past years, I have had the ideation and its always been in my head. I did some research on the matter and had plans on going through with it. Whenever I would try to carry it out, something happens that stops me from doing it. Im taking this as a sign that theres a reason for it. I am still needed here. But most of the time, I think ""Why am I even here? Why am I still breathing?"". I have even thought that if I can trade places with someone that deserves it more, I would be more than willing to. I dont see any reason for me to hang on to this mortal plane.   


My thoughts nowadays are so all over the place, its hard to keep track when you have a gazillion things in your mind at the same time. These days, I dont feel good everyday. I have very supportive friends and family, especially my older sister (my cousin) that makes me feel so loved. I am hanging for them mostly. I dont want them to be sad. Nowadays, I have been mostly absent to most of the people in my life. Its hard to deal with other people when you dont have the energy. Waking up daily is already a struggle, top that up with Work problems, personal relationship, romantic relationship (I am single for more than 6 months now - my partner of more than 7 years cheated on me which added a lot to the struggle that Im already dealing with - I cant blame him tho, I get tired of myself too and I know I have opportunities myself; Still not reason enough to cheat), finances (I have a ton of loans and bills that is already past due - for many months that I have experienced getting my power and internet cut due to delinquencies). I was a dumb broke youngster before, now, I am just dumb and broke. This year is a mess for me, this year sucks balls and dick.   


Right now, Im doing everything that I can to stay afloat. Surviving day after day. I want to think that someday, all the pain and suffering will pave the way to a brighter and better future for me if depression and all my mental issues doesnt get me first. I was crying when I started typing, like sobbing and snot crying. Writing about my struggles helped me somehow. I'll keep doing this. I know a lot are struggling too, the way that I do. Even its a 0.001% hope, lets hang on to that tiny sliver of hope. Who knows that might be the silver lining we've all been waiting for. To all the folks like me, there is HOPE. There is GOD. Things could be difficult at times but when its tough, I find that praying helps.  I started this feeling like its the end and now I feel hopeful. Whoever comes across this, I hope you feel better too. I know there will be more episodes like this, but if it helped me, I hope it would help you too. 

Im ending this whatever this is here and before I do, Im sending love and hugs and kisses to everyone that needs them. You are awesome, you are amazing and you are doing a good job hanging on. You are loved and you are limited edition, so dont go doing something that we cant undo. 'Mkay?

'Ghosted' by my 1st therapist,"Hello. I don't think I would be able to ask for some specific 'help' for this question as this happened 2 years ago, but I'd just like to ask for your opinions about my issue and maybe see if my reaction was warranted. I'm posting this on a throwaway for obvious reasons.

I have a new therapist now, and if I haven't seen this new one, I wouldn't have known the red flags my previous therapist did.

Basically I was fed up with suffering from anxiety, and I wanted to ask for help. I contacted a local psychotherapist, and they ignored me for a couple weeks until one day when I messaged them on fb, they said yes to an appointment.

When we had our session, they told me they said yes because I was persistent (red flag: you're supposed to set your schedule based on availability vs. mood whims). We did not do an assessment during our first session. We didn't even set treatment goals (red flag). I was excited because I thought I was doing the right thing, and they listened. For someone who has not experienced being listened to this deeply (by family), and finally be getting the help I was supposed be getting, I was excited. 

But during our sessions, they would talk about themselves and give personal life anecdotes. They even cried at one session when they shared a personal anecdote about love. They were also very religious and interchanged 'god' with 'the universe' to share their anecdotes with me (I didnt have a problem with this, I respect their religiosity). They also asked me for advice to help them on their other client, who was a closeted queer kid. I was so excited to give advice to them regarding SOGIE. Little did I know it was a massive red flag (not to mention illegal, and unethical) that they were telling me about their other client, and more so asking me for advice, when that was their job, and I had nothing to do with their other client.

But then after a lot of sessions, I built up the courage to open up about my deepest secret: sexual abuse. They listened. But after that session, they ghosted me. They wouldn't reply to my texts. They would ignore me. I was petty one time and asked their office to do a talk on one small event I was organizing and they sent a proxy. At that point, I didn't know a way to confront them. I felt betrayed because I felt like I was being punished for talking about my deepest secret. I felt shame, self-doubt, and I felt like I was shunned for talking about my problems; like my issues didn't warrant resolution despite me looking for ways to seek help / help myself be better.

And so when I got my second therapist, I found out about all the red flags. I know therapists are human, and it was unfortunate and unfair that this happened to me, but sometimes we need to know what constitutes a good one vs a bad one. I would later find out they would do therapy sessions with a client in public places, and even have drinks at a bar (inuman) with them as a ""session."" They are also a staple in the local mental health community, and they talked about 'building their legacy' in the community as something they were working towards (They talked about this one of our sessions. They help the local community ie. poor and disenfranchised, and I felt that maybe they found my issues to be petty and privileged vs the people with the ""real"" issues who needed their help more). 

What I found so degrading was that they could have just suggested me to a different therapist if they found that they weren't helping me, and that that is actually the protocol, and that they could have had their license revoked because of this. Really sad, cause they were a topnotcher in the psych board exams too, and is a psych professor at a local uni. I thought they were good.

And so now sometimes I am reminded of them, and I feel ashamed that I told a total stranger whom I had confidence in and trusted (and who also has history talking about their clients' issues to their other clients, which I hope didn't also include their colleagues or other people), my deepest, darkest secret. And they're free to live their lives like they didn't deeply scar someone else's. I don't want revenge. I don't want anything to happen to them, but at least maybe one day they realize their mistake.

I am so happy with my current therapist. What was once an aimless set of sessions from my 1st therapist (which frankly were glorified and paid rant sessions) have turned into goal setting and achieving. I have gotten better, and I now have tools to use to help me with my anxiety and depression. I'm glad I gave therapy a second chance.

I guess I'd like for your opinions lang on this situation? And also to tell you this story to help see red flags with therapists. Thanks for listening and I hope you guys have a fruitful journey towards better mental health.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/pdae79/ghosted_by_my_1st_therapist/,t2_e6yd4u37,1630159622.0
I really need some advice,"I have been feeling very sad and lonely a lot lately, I mean I have had a lot of problems with my emotions never making sense to me and a lot of it is because I just always think my feelings or invalid or I am just being a baby or something, I am a F(19) and I have PTSD and Anxiety from my childhood trauma caused by my dads sexual and mental abuse as a child, I am out of that environment now and I live alone in a different state away from my family and I am in therapy but I still have the same mindset that my feelings don’t matter and I’m too scared to talk about how I really feel. With my therapist we only talk about healing from my trauma or something regarding it but whenever she asks me how I am doing I can’t help but lie, I’m too scared to talk about how I feel and I’ve always been like that, I just don’t know how to express my feelings, it makes me feel so vulnerable. I can do it a little, sometimes I can tell her if I have anxiety regarding my trauma because it’s hard to talk about it and I am able to talk to my boyfriend sometimes about how I feel but he is not always the best listener and I am just not getting the advice of comfort from him that I need. Right now I am posting here because I feel a little better talking to people I don’t know why have never seen me and will hopefully be able to give me some advice, what I am feeling right now doesn’t make sense to me very much and it isn’t in regard to my trauma, I just have been feeling so lonely and sad and I cry a lot because I miss my boyfriend who I hardly get to see because he is so busy with school and work and so am I, we love 15 minutes from each other but we only see each other about 4 times a month, I feel selfish for wanting to ask him to see me more when I know he doesn’t get much time to relax but I am just so lonely, I have never been good at making friends and I was bullied all the way up to 9th grade, I Have adhd/add and I tend to be either really quiet or really loud, I have a really hard time focusing and I’m pretty sure I’m dumb and obvious and a lot of people must think that too. I don’t know anyone in this state who I am close to except for my boyfriend and I want to make friends but I’m not good at it. I just feel so lonely I miss him so bad and I just want to be happy but it’s so hard. I just feel like I’m being dramatic and I’m a baby, I just really don’t know what to do, does anyone have any advice on how I might be able to see my boyfriend more and how to make friends so I won’t be so lonely when I can’t?",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/p7n0cz/i_really_need_some_advice/,t2_92ly24gp,1629405102.0
Need opinions and suggestions... (long post),"Di ko alam kung saan ko ipopost to kaya dito nalang. This is a long post pls bare with me. I will try to tell every detail. Kinda creepy too.

So I have a 47 y.o Tita who’s an encoder in a data company. Masayahin sya tapos medyo masungit din, strict sa lahat ng bagay. Pinagstay-in sila ng company nila due to Covid-19. Okay pa sya nung nagsimula sya mag stay-in don pero nung inuwi sya samin wala na sya sa sarili nya.

It all started when she texted my mom na baka mawalan daw sya ng trabaho kasi nagka error sya. Sabi nya may narinig daw sya na nagsasabi na matatanggal sya. Sabi lang ng mom ko kung may binigay na bang memo sakanya, sabi nya wala pa naman so sabi ng mom ko na wag muna isipin. Then after nun iba na yung mga tinetext nya sa mom ko. May text sya na “ano ba ito parang past, present, future yung pumapasok sa isip ko”.

The following days hinatid na sya sa bahay nila ng lola ko. Ibang iba na sya. Hindi na namin makausap ng maayos. Kung ano ano na sinasabi. She keeps on insisting na gusto nya daw bumalik dun sa pinagstay-in nila kasi naiwan nya daw yung katawan nya don, hindi daw sya yun. 

Nagkwento yung supervisor nya na napansin nalang nila na may kinakausap na sya na hindi nila nakikita. Hindi daw natutulog ilang araw na. Kaya pinauwi na sya.

Kinagabihan nagwala sya. Nagsisipa tapos sinasabi na “umalis kayo! umalis kayo!” tinanong sya ng lola ko kung sino yung pinapaalis nya sabi nya “itong mga demonyong to! gusto ako gamitin. umalis kayo!” Hindi pa din sya natutulog. Ayaw din kumain.

The next day, nagpunta sya samin mag isa (we live 5 streets away from theirs). Hinabol sya ng lola ko. Then nung nakita ng lola ko na samin nagpunta umuwi na din sya kasi may ginagawa sya. Then maya maya umalis na naman tita ko, sinundan ng asawa ko kasi baka mawala sya. Ayaw nya sumama pabalik. Tumambay sya sa may lumang bahay tapos mapuno na bakuran. Pinuntahan sila ng mama ko at sumama naman. Pero mga ilang minuto lang gusto na naman nya umalis kaya binantayan na namin yung gate. Sabi nya may kakausapin daw sya don (sa tinambayan nya). Nung nasamin sya kumakain na sya. Kinagabihan nung umuwi na sila ng lola ko,  maya maya bumalik na naman samin hinabol na naman sya ng lola ko. Umuwi ulit sila pero bumalik na naman sya. Kaya pinagstay nalang namin sya dito samin. 

Dumating yung hating gabi, nagwawala sya. Niyuyogyog nya yung kapatid ko na lagi nyang binabanggit akala nya patay na. Nasuntok nya din mama ko tapos sabi “mga walang hiya kayo! ano ginawa nyo sakin!” Di pa rin sya natulog. We even put sleeping pills on her milk pero di tumalab sakanya.

Kinaumagahan okay na ulit sya. Calm na ulit pero may kinakausap pa din. Kumain sya ng tanghalian pero nung kinagabihan di nya sya kumain. Nagwala na naman sya tapos umiiyak sabi “ano ginawa nyo sa mga pamangkin ko! mga walang hiya kayo!” (okay naman kami lahat na mga pamangkin nya) tapos sa may gate gusto lumabas. Nakapadlock na yung gate namin kasi nga baka lumabas. Sumisigaw sya na “mga walang hiya kayo!”

Next day pinacheck up na sya nila mama sa psychiatrist. She was diagnosed with depression and schizophrenia.

These are the factors that may have trigger it:

Homesick - nagpapaalam pala sya na umuwi kasi nalulungkot sya pero di sya pinayagan ( isa sa mga sinasabi nya dun sa “kausap” nya) lagi din daw sya naiiwan mag isa dun sa pinagsstay-in nila kasi iba yung shift nya.

Heartbroken - meron syang katextmate who stopped texting her since may 13 na accdng to the texts nanliligaw sakanya pero may nakwento din sya dun sa katext nya na may nagugustuhan daw sya pero di sya pinapansin. di sya nagkekwento samin abt dun sa lalaki. nbsb din tita ko. tapos isa din sa mga sinasabi nya na gusto pa daw nya mag asawa.

Sa trabaho nya - yung sinabi nya sa mom ko na baka mawalan sya ng trabaho or something happened to her there kasi isa sa mga sinasabi nya na ayaw na daw bumalik don kasi mga salbahe daw mga tao dun.

and one thing also na medyo nag-aalangan kami, possible na she had been a victim of sexual assault- kasi napobserve namin sakanya masyado syang consious sa lower part nya. gusto nya mahaba lagi damit nya tapos pantalon lang lagi suot nya. pag nagshorts sya binabalutan nya ng sapin yung lower part nya. ayaw nya din pahawak.

also mga pinoy naman tayo, baka namaligno sya or wtvr. kasi may bantay daw sya. yun yung kausap nya lagi. pinatawas na din sya nila mama sabi daw meron daw lalaki na gusto syang kunin. also yung pinag sstayan nila dati daw hospital yun.

back to the story.. 
since they got back from the psychiatrist iyak na sya ng iyak. ayaw na din nya kumain tapos uminom ng tubig. ayaw nya din magtake ng meds. hinalo na din namin sa drinks nya yung gamot nya pero ayaw naman nya inumin. nilalason daw namin sya.

hanggang ngayon hindi parin namin sya napapainom ng gamot. my mom is losing her patience on her coz she’s so stubborn. we tried helping to kaso wala talaga. naawa na din kami sa lola ko kasi may isa pa kong tito na may mental illness due to drug abuse tapos inaalagan pa nya yung tatlong anak ng tito kong yun.

any suggestions on how to get her eat or drink meds? possible din ba na victim sya ng sexual assault? need nya din ba ipagamot sa arbularyo just incase, kasi yung pinatake sakanya na sleeping pills nung mga unang araw matapang daw yun pero di tumatalab sakanya. part lang ba ng symptoms nya yung mga sinasabi nya na creepy things abt demons?

thank you po sa mga sasagot at sa mga magbabasa hehe.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/gu38ws/need_opinions_and_suggestions_long_post/,t2_4bk3vm1f,1590946687.0
the country does not have MH resources for my condition. kuwento na rin.,"Hopeless case nga talaga ako. I've been to the best hospitals and therapists/doctors in the NCR area. One of which told my mom that I will never be happy, so they will just focus on giving me things to do. Unfortunately I heard that, but it happens to be true.

\[long story, pasensya na po\]

I have autism that went undiagnosed until I was 20something because of the stigma. Even though all the signs were there. Pinabayaan ako. Looking back, kahit magkasakit ako o mainjure sa school walang may paki. Nung grade one ako, nadapa ako sa semento nung may sack race at dumugo ang siko ko. Pumasok lang ako sa klase na nagdudugo sa panyo ko, walang pumansin kahit pag-uwi ko. And I was clueless kaya di rin ako pumunta sa clinic. Tiniis ko lang kung anong sakit ng tiyan o lagnat o bali natamo ko noong bata ako up to high school or college. Nanakawan ako ng wallet sa unang college ko at parang wala lang. I had no friends and thought it was my fault so I made extra efforts, joined clubs. Wala pa rin. Kapag may problema ako nawawala lahat ng akala ko friends ko.

I probably did and said a lot of weird things too but I did not mean bad and nobody corrected me. Was just ostracized for the most part, not actually bullied. I even went on a date with a stranger one night and I was so proud of myself for being brave. Buti nalang sinabihan ako ng kabatch ko na creepy ang nangyari at wag nang makipagkita dun. At least that friend saved me in that case kasi the guy was stroking my thigh during the trip and took me back to the dorm so he knew where I stayed. Creepy nga in hindsight pero sobrang tanga ko. I was 16 and living far from home. I never told my family about this. It was shortly after that incident that my wallet was stolen. Nung nadepress ako nung taon na yun, my family just assumed it was because of the lost wallet. But actually it was a lot of things, including losing the friend who gave the advice as well as the creepy guy. Even now I wonder, what if I didn't listen to her and went with him?

Suggestion ng friends ko online na tumawag ako sa suicide hotline. The problem is I have severe sensory and processing issues. In short di ko kaya tumawag sa phone. I can type a lot of text because I'm only focusing on one thing. Pero pag live conversation overwhelmed na ako. I can't even VC with my own friends, how can I talk to a stranger? Lahat ng suicide hotline sa Pinas walang chat support haha, nagmessage ako sa FB nila. Mamatay nalang kaya ako hahahaha.

Lahat ng mga resources dito for autism ay para sa mga bata at early interventions. Nung bata ako wala pa yung asperger's o high functioning autism kaya walang maitulong sa akin. Now it's too late. Ibuhos ko nalang lahat dito at baka sakali magkatapang akong tapusin buhay ko. Nobody takes my disability seriously anyway. I can't go for online therapy because of the talking problem. Walang combination ng meds na gumana sa akin. Worse, lumala yung health ko. I became obese and developed asthma. Sirang-sira rin ang sleeping patterns ko. All those health problems didn't exist before I took psych meds. Kasi nga nagdoble effort ako nung una, sumali ako sa sports clubs, tried to live healthy and be social.

Pag may nangyaring incident o may problema ako, ako ang sinisisi. Kahit nung nagwowork ako at unfair ang mga boss ko. They would talk behind my back about me and my coworkers. It got so bad na dalawa ang nagquit kaya in the end ginagawa ko trabaho ng tatlong tao, three different offices pinupuntahan ko. And they also accused me of something I would never do, that is to badmouth them to a higher authority. Kasi, not to name names pero working student ako nun. Sa state university ako nagtatrabaho pero sa city college ako nag-aaral. Sinisiraan nila sa work yung city college ko. To the point na mas gusto pa nilang mag-aral sa private school and mga bata na hindi nakapasa sa kanila kaysa mag-aral sa public din. Sabi-sabi na aagawin daw ng city college ang pondo ng state uni. At naniwala naman ang mga bata. Bakit ko naman sila isusumbong sa city eh hindi naman ako close sa mga boss dun? Pero ang masakit talaga ay yung mga accusation sa amin ng mga coworkers ko. Panay ang siraan nila sa isa, slow at bobo daw (pero college grad, paano nangyari yun?), yun pala PWD din siya, mahina ang tenga. Nagkaroon ng incident at kailangan magleave nung taong yun pero nung babalik na, ayaw tanggapin. At the time I was already doing the work of three so we really needed the help. Actually anim ang nirerequest namin na staff. Kahit sino pa yan, sana kinuha na nila.

I had been begging my mom to help me transfer to a different department because it was getting toxic. Twice kinausap namin ng mga kawork ko si mama ko at once we consulted with the HR pero di nila kami nilipat. And then came the almost sexual harassment incident. May three days na Lakbay Aral at sumama doon lahat ng admin pati karamihan ng prof. May isa akong kaclose na male prof, parang tatay ko na yun na naiwan sa campus. Mag-isa lang ako sa admin office noon at sinubukan niya akong halikan sa labi. Natakot ako at sinabi ko sa mama ko at sa immediate superior ko. Kinausap ni mama yung boss ko at sinabing wag akong iiwan mag-isa sa office. Hindi ko siya kinasuhan ng sexual harassment kasi mawawalan ng pension yung prof kung may kaso siya.

Later on gusto ko na talagang umalis sa work ko dahil nga sa hindi nila pagtanggap sa kawork ko. As in gusto kong patayin ang boss ko dahil sa discrimination nila against PWDs. Nalaman nila yun at nagsecret meeting yung admin at mom ko. Edi ang resulta, mag-isa nanaman ako sa admin office at walang maisagot sa mga clients. Ayos, diba? Nakatanggap ako ng angry call from parents saka mga special visitors at wala akong masabi, walang bilin kahit kay kuya guard man lang. We didn't know if the admins will be back and when. Nakakahiya sobra. My mom betrayed me and sided with the bosses who were abusing us PWDs and accusing us of things we didn't do. Nagkaroon kasi ng nakawan sa school kaya lahat kaming staff suspect. Pero yung job orders ang pinag-initan. Pagbalik nila, kinausap ako ng campus director kunwari friendly, yun pala pinapagleave ako. Pero nung sinabi ko problema ko tinawanan lang ako. He mocked me. Sabi joke lang daw yung sinabi sa faculty meeting na baka ako daw nagsabi sa city admin na nilalabanan nila yung city college. Joke? May tumawa ba? May nagdepensa ba sa akin, iclear man lang pangalan ko? Wala. Nagwala ko and the next thing I know, I was being pinned down by two men sa labas ng opisina. Bisita lang yung isa at hawak niya leeg ko. Parang gusto pang higpitan sa leeg para takutin ako. As if. I wanted to kill and be killed, suicidal na ako noon kaya walang masama kung tuluyan nila ako. Ganyan sila mga normie/neurotypical, lahat ng problema kasalanan ng may mental illness. Ngayon alam ko nang wala akong kakampi kahit saan man ako magpunta. Isisisi lang sa akin lahat ng aberya. Kaming mga PWD at may mental issues ang laging nilalaglag. Sinisira nila ang mga pagkatao at buhay namin.

Pero di pa din nagtapos kalbaryo ko. Nawalan na nga ako ng trabaho pero tuloy pa rin paninira nila sa akin. May estudyante kasi na scholar, bagong graduate na kaibigan naming mga staff at crush ko. He had financial problems, self-supporting at mukhang on the spectrum din. Pinahiraman ko ng reviewer for CPA. Nanakawan siya ng pera na supposed to be para sa grad fee. Pag-graduate niya ay binigyan ko siya ng konting pera at graduation gift. Nagkataong nanakawan ulit siya after kong matanggal sa trabaho, at nahuli niya yung magnanakaw. Yung ka-staff ko na nagquit pero di pinilit bumalik. Akala namin kaibigan siya but she was manipulating us to think she was sympathetic tapos ganoon nga. Ninakawan mga scholars na gipit na nga sa pera. Tapos bibigay siyang konting tulong para mukha siyang mabait. Inutangan pa ako para mapakita lang na di siya magnanakaw. Unfortunately ang alam nitong scholar-graduate ay kakutsaba din ako. He wrote a long post on FB accusing both the thief and myself of manipulating and stealing from him, and at the same time, blocked me so I can't explain my side. As far as I know, nobody corrected him for my sake.

Pasensya na po sa mahabang story time/rant. Nabubuwisit na ako sa hopeless kong kalagyan. Kung tutuusin nga ay delikado kung maghanap pa ako ng trabaho, considering how easy it is for people to manipulate me baka next time ma-r\*pe ako o mawalan ng malaking halaga o maligaw sa Manila - and then I will still be the one to blame oh diba ang saya?

Kung mukhang familiar itong kuwento at narerecognize mo sarili mo sa incidents, CONGRATS, SINIRA MO BUHAY KO. CONGRATULATIONS ON BEING NORMAL. YOU WIN.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/11jvz0r/the_country_does_not_have_mh_resources_for_my/,t2_f81f4p4m,1678101146.0
