I was physically abused my boyfriend (now my ex),"I‚Äôm 23 F and was physically abused by my ex last Feb 13. It was really bad, I was in pain all over my body and I had severe pain on head and scalp because of the punching and hair pulling I received. I couldn‚Äôt sleep the night after it happened because even with soft pillows masakit pa din. I had spent my Valentine‚Äôs Day in the hospital to get checked. I went to my usual doctor but she refused to see me after knowing my situation. She refused because she doesn‚Äôt want to get involved if ever magsampa ako ng kaso sa ex ko. I told her I‚Äôm not planning to and I just wanted to get checked kasi masakit talaga buong katawan ko but she still refused to get me checked and instead referred me to a general surgeon. There, I was interviewed again by another secretary and was asked why I was referred to their clinic. I gave her the referral and told her I wanted to get checked because I was physically abused. After hearing that, she proceeded to ask questions personal questions as to why I was physically abused. And not only her, even the surgeon asked me personal stuff. Idk if it‚Äôs part of their job to ask but it was really uncomfortable for me. I remember crying in the cr right after the consultation. I feel so embarrassed, so ashamed of the situation I‚Äôm in. I feel like people are judging me for being physically abused. The way people are treating me felt like it was my fault that I got myself physically abused. I was asked to get a ct scan of my brain because of head trauma injury. I was using my insurance so i went to the hmo cashier with the doctor‚Äôs referral. While processing, the cashier asked loudly why I had to get a brain plain bec apparently it was expensive and they wouldn‚Äôt easily approve it. There was a line behind me and i was embarrassed to say it out loud so iasked if i could write it instead. I wrote what my doctor wrote in his diagnosis, head trauma injury due to physical abuse.  The cashier seemed confused and asked me, ‚Äúwhat do you mean by physical abuse?‚Äù She then told me to write a full incident report, time date and what has happened to me. So, I wrote there in detail what happened to me so that she‚Äôll process na my form and I could get a ct scan na. Is this really part of the protocol? Do the patient really have to do this? Because it was really uncomfortable for my part. I was physically in pain and it doesn‚Äôt help that they‚Äôre also stressing me out mentally, making me recall everything that happened just so it would be approved by my insurance. It‚Äôs so fucking stressful for the patient. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm grateful man na i get to go to the hospital to get treated but i didnt expect it to be this stressful. I even chose to go to this hospital, my university‚Äôs hospital, because I thought it would be more efficient than going to a public hospital. If only I knew na I would be rejected by my doctor, will be bombarded by personal questions, judged for being physically abused, and then forced to recall what happened to me, then I would‚Äôve just stayed home na lang even though sakit na kaayo akong lawas. I‚Äôm supposed to go back to the doctor today, but idk man, i dont feel like getting up and going back. I‚Äôm still in pain tho, masakit pa din igalaw ang katawon ko but agwantahon lang guro nako ni than go back.

why do Filipino famillies resort to physical abuse and humiliation whenever their child makes a mistake?,"I recently crashed my mom‚Äôs car around 1am cus I was going to another town to find something to eat. While it was raining hard I was driving casually with my highbeam turned on, suddenly I hit an ‚Äúschool-zone‚Äù signage pretty hard and it caused for the front of the car to be shattered. Regardless, I waited for my mom to get back from work so I can tell her ASAP. When she got back I told her directly that I recked her car and said all my apologies and told her I was willing to accept all consequences. She suddenly slapped me so hard that I fell to the floor. She probably bruised my whole body from smacking me with a broom stick for 1 hour straight and after that she had enough. While I was inside my room I overheard her talking to all of her friends and our relatives on how I am such a disappointment and basically degraded me to her friends.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/17mlwmo/why_do_filipino_famillies_resort_to_physical/,t2_63lybacdt,1698982138.0
Namatay na yung tita ko who physically & emotionally abused me & my sister nung highschool kami pero wala akong naramdaman nung nawala sya.,"Napatawad ko na sya. Nakahingi pa nga sya ng tawad 2 months bago sya namatay. Sabi ko, wala na yun tita. Kalimutan mo na yun.  Totoong napatawad ko na sya pero traumatized pa rin ako pag may mga bagay na nakakapang trigger sa akin ng mga bad memories na iyon.

Unexpected ang death nya. Nasa Canada na ko ngayon. Nung nabalitaan ko yon, iyak ng iyak mama ko. Pero ako, wala. Blanko lang. Of course hindi ako masaya sa nangyari pero hindi rin naman ako nalungkot at naapektuhan.

I feel bad for feeling this way.

7 years din kaming nasa puder nya. May mga good memories naman pero bilang lang. Pag lang naka mood sya pag may pera sya that time. Pag wala, ayun, Princess Sarah at Ms. Minchin na ang atake.

Hindi ko masabi to sa mama ko kasi alam kong masasaktan sya. Kapatid nya yun at mahal nya. Kahit may nagawang ganun ang tita ko, sobrang buti ng mama ko at pinatawad nya.

Sabi ng mama kahit ano raw nagawang masama sa amin, wag na wag daw kaming hihiling ng ikakasama ng iba.

Gusto ko lang din sabihin na proud ako na sya ang mama ko. <3",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/19987qx/namatay_na_yung_tita_ko_who_physically/,t2_knsfqyyap,1705526681.0
"The girl I like has a girlfriend, and her girlfriend was physically abusing her.","The girl I like has a girlfriend, and her girlfriend was physically abusing her. She's also my friend from school, and I feel inlove with her. And yes I'm les. Nung 2021 kasi, nagkaroon sya ng gf na kaklase rin namin, it was fine with me, I'm actually happy for them. Not until magkwento sakin yung friend ko na gusto ko pa rin until now na sinasaktan daw sya ng gf nya physically kapag nagagalit yung gf nya, and nabanggit nya rin na yung gf nya ay pinagtatawanan sya sa harap ng mga kaibigan ng gf nya pag umiiyak sya. And habang kinukwento nya sakin to sobrang tumatayo yung balahibo ko to the point na hindi ko na alam kung anong sasabihin ko, I can't say naman na hiwalayan nya na kasi baka isipin nyang sinabi ko yon for my benefit, and first time ko lang din makaencounter ng ganong situation, kaya super hindi ko alam kung anong pwede kong sabihin para matulungan ko sya or dapat bang tulungan ko sya since friend ko naman sya eh. Hindi ko rin masabing hiwalayan nya kasi wala naman ako sa posisyon para sabihin sakanya yon and I know kung gano nya kamahal gf nya kaya tinitiis nya lahat ng bugbog sakanya. Ayaw nya ring may ibang makaalam sa family nilang dalawa. Any tips kung anong pwedeng sabihin or gawin or dapat ba wag na akong makielam since relationship naman nilang dalawa yon? 

to add lang din, nagkaroon pala yung gf nya ng bf sa work na pamilyadong tao, and ayaw nya ipakita sa friend ko yung cp nya kasi nga tinatago nya pero sya sa friend ko, kontrolado nya lahat ng social media nya na kahit mga kaklase nya for acad purposes ay pinagbabawalan nya makipag usap sa friend ko. Kahit ako hindi ko na rin sya nakakausap, nakwento nya lang sakin nung time na nanghiram sya ng book for acads din.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/10dhbeu/the_girl_i_like_has_a_girlfriend_and_her/,t2_vh4zj41l,1673882774.0
Na survive ko ang physical at emotional abuse today,"3 sampal at katakot takot na threats dahil sa walang humpay na pag iyak ko, sampalin ka ba naman eh. 

Para akong mababaliw kanina, hinihila, sinisiko, pinipilit mag salita, tinutulak. Para akong pinalong aso sa pag iyak  na naka suksok sa sulok tas pag hinahawakan lalong lumalakas ang iyak dahil nakakatakot na bawat hawak sayo may hagupit na kapalit. 

Hindi ko akalain na magagawa sakin ng SO (now ex) ko to. First time kong masaktan sa relationship at trauma is real. Dahil lang sa di ko masunod ang gusto nya kahit at risk ang health ko. 

Tinapos ko na at sana huling encounter na namin sa isa't Isa. Naiiyak ako pag naiisip ko yung ginawa nya. Mahal nya daw ako pero bakit ganun? Pag mamahal pa ba yun kung ganoon?

Violence Against Men,"TW: Physical Abuse

It just feels disappointing that men have no legal protection against any form of abuse or domestic violence. I (M31) had an ex gf who used to hurt me physically, and it occurred many times. Note that I did not cheat on her nor committed any grave offense against her. But everytime her emotions piled up, she used to hurt me physically, as in I got slaps on my face, arm, etc. 

After 9 months, I called it quits. I did not stand the abuse anymore. 

While women and children have legal protection, men are ought to just endure it and shut up, otherwise we will be viewed as weak ass pussies. Pardon the french.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/183less/violence_against_men/,t2_jhn2qk11,1700924078.0

Living with my abuser.,"#Trigger warning 
#I need help. 

#I married a monster.

Long post ahead. Please bare with me.  

I consider myself as a single mom of many kids. 

Isipin niyo na lahat ng word na pwede niyo ikabit sa word na abused. Ako yun. 

Sinasaktan niya ako if I refuse to have sex with him. Ang sabi niya ‚Äúresponsibilidad‚Äù ko daw yun bilang asawa. NO THAT‚ÄôS MARITAL RAPE kako. Meron pang isang bagay na gustong gusto niya ginagawa pero di ko na masasabi kasi it will be a give away. (Sexual and physical abuse). 
He cheated on me and I had STD not once, not twice‚Ä¶ I told him that it‚Äôs actually ground for annulment. Feeling ko ang dumi dumi ko. 

Ilan taon na ako lang ang bumuhay sa pamilya namin. (Economic abuse) 

Gina-gaslight niya ako and he used emotional manipulation. He one time said he‚Äôd kill himself dahil ayaw kong makipag sex sa kanya.  (Emotional abuse). 

To name a few. 

Ilang beses na akong nag attempt na makipag hiwalay sa kanya, but he knows I have a forgiving heart. Pero lahat my limit. Nauubos din tayo. 

We moved to a different city to start a new life. Ang alam ng mga friends ko hiwalay na kami. Which is partly true. Di ko lang sinabi na nagkabalikan kami kasi I used it as an excuse (not my proudest moment) I don‚Äôt like telling lies. Siguro napapansin nila na di ko sinasagot yung mga tanong nila. Para di na ako mag lie pa. 

It was so bad na umabot ako sa point that I almost kill myself. 2 tao lang nakakaalam nito. 

Few years ago he throw a fit kasi ayaw kong makipag sex sa kanya. I was so tired galing sa work tapos ako pa naglinis ng house. He was jobless. Pag di nagwo-work yung pagwawala niya he resorts to verbal abuse towards my kids. Hindi ko kinaya. I begged him to kill me para matapos na lahat ng paghihirap ko. Few months after that nagtino. So kala ko ok na. Nope. Nagkawork lang siya pero ganun pa din. Masaya kaming lahat sa bahay pag wala siya. Tahimik ang mundo. 

Couple of years ago I decided na ayaw ko na talaga. I told him to move out. But he didn‚Äôt. But for me hiwalay na kami. Pinaalis ko siya sa room. No physical contact di ko kinakausap nakablock sa lahat. I decided to take care of myself again. Nag message siya bigla using a different number, asking for sex. Like WTF! Seryoso? He began stalking my accounts. Called me a slut at may lalake daw ako. 

Last year he beat the shit out of me. Nag pa blotter ako, VAWC, pati sa Barangay. Walang nangyari. Sabi aalis na siya ng bahay pero nandito pa din. He threatens to kill me harm my family and friends at work. 

Madami siya kilala na influential na tao.

I left the chat group.,"She got abusive partner. 
I‚Äôll make this short and simple. 
3 kami sa group namin, mag kakainigan nakami since highschool so more than a decade na. 
Si A meron siyang 2 naging partner and both may anak siya sa dalawa. 
Nag cheat siya sa unang partner niya kaya, pinili niya yung 2nd partner niya kasi nabuntis siya. 
Now yung 2nd partner niya is sinasaktan suya physically. 2x na siyang sinakal and yung last time sa labas pa ng apartment nila at kita ng lahat ng tao. 

The guy already have ‚Äòmental health issue‚Äô kuno pero ayaw naman patingin. Dati inuuntog niya lang sarili niya sa pader pag nag aaway sila. Tapos ngayon nananakit na siya. Hindi sinabi ng guy ano exact reason bat niya ginawa yun regardless di parin sapat na reason yun para manakit. 

Kaya lang sila nag kakaganyan dahil hirap sila financial. Stay at home si A kasi breastfeed pa ang baby nila. 

Going back sa guy, nagpaawa siya na kesyo sirang sira na daw siya saamin, habang siya wala daw siyang mapagsabihan kasi ayaw niya daw masira si A. 
Masira from what?? Kahit saan angle mo tignan maling manakit or mag resort sa physical. Babae pa naman baby nila di niya naisip na yung sinasaktan niya is nanay ng anak niya? 

Anyway, na guilty daw si A sabi niya sa group chat. 
Hindi nalang ako umimik kasi sobrang galit ako bigyan pa daw niya ng last chance. 

And that‚Äôs when i rant. Saying na ang galing magpaawa ng lalaki, nakuha kanya sa ganyan, remind him about our law may VAWC tayo baka gusto niya mag himas rehas, etc etc.. 

Sagot ni A ‚Äòmove on na tayo let‚Äôs give him last chance‚Äô 

My last chat before i leave sa GC 

‚ÄòPass, bat ko siya bibigyan ng chance? Ikaw lang magbibigay ng chance sakanya. Balitaan niyo nalang ako pag makikipag lamay ako sa burol mo‚Äô 

Galit ako,oo
Pero anong gusto nila? Makisama at magbulag bulagan? Hindi ba enabler ang tawag saakin pag hinahayaan ko lang? 

I left the GC kasi pagod na ako. Pagod na akong damayan siya tapos wala naman din siyang gagawin para ayusin situation niya. Di ko narin masikmuraan na makipag plastikan dun sa guy. 

Pagod na ako marinig ngawa niya sa GC tapos sasabihan kami na ‚Äòlet‚Äôs give him another chance‚Äô 

Damayan niyo naman ako! HAHAHA gusto ko lang talaga ilabas tong gigil ko.

Edit: just to add pala. Her mom is also victim of physical abuse. So nasaksihan niya yung pambugbog ng tatay niya. Her mom told her na iwan na yung guy the first time na sinaktan siya cuz her mom is right ‚Äòmauulit at mauulit yon. Magiging habit na nya‚Äô

Mahirap ma abused ng babae sa Pilipinas,"My ex (now colleague) still harasses me kahit na ilang beses na akong nag plead na layuan na nya at tigilan na nya ko. Ilang beses akong nagmamakaawa pero hindi nya marespeto yun. Lagi nya kong hinarass sa chat/text at in person. We broke up for almost 6 months and she still thinks na kami pa rin until now. Guarding me with my every move. 

She's confronting or harassing me because:

1. Nagmamakaawa siya na maging kami ulit
2. She keeps saying na ako yung sinungaling at manipulative. 
3. Manunumbat siya sa lahat ng nagawa nya for me
4. Tinatakot nya ko na mag suicide siya pag di ko siya kinausap. 

I've been enduring that cycle repeatedly week for 6 months. Masakit lang sa part ko na she's making things up para mag mukhang victim and the fact na nagmakaawa na ko sa kanya na to stop confronting me everytime may relapse sya. Tbh, sobrang draining sa mental health and I can't seek for help Kasi I'm a guy and ang hirap i prove na I am verbally, physically and psychologically abused.

It's my first time hearing my partner sing her heart out after 2 months,"Mahaba haba to, your choice if babasahin mo :)

I'm 22M and my partner's 21F, we're both living with my parents. Everything's all great, it felt like I'm living the dream. Parehong may savings, nabibili namin lahat ng mga gusto namin, and of course, nakakatulong din kami sa bills dito sa bahay. She was 19yrs old when we decided na mag live in na, given the fact na sobrang abusive sakanya ng mga tao sa bahay nila (verbal and physical abuse), nagka trauma and depression siya that time so I told her na whatever her decision, my family and I will welcome her sa house namin. We both earn 30k monthly since nasa parehong company lang kami.. 

But then, March 28, we lost our baby. She was 3 months pregnant at that time. She wanted to quit her job so I let her be, she needed time to grieve, to breathe, and to heal. I know I do too but, she's my first priority. It's very heart breaking BUT we can always make another one. That's when she started to be quiet. No words. No reactions. Barely eating. Ni hindi kami nag uusap ng matino, just pure presence is all that we have that time. Hindi siya lumalabas ng bahay. Hindi niya rin kinakausap mga friends niya and kahit sino dito sa bahay. She ignored us for 2 months. Some may say that she's unfair and that she never thought of how I would feel sa ginagawa niya. Na hindi lang siya ang nawalan.

Pero kahit na hindi siya nagsasalita, or kahit na hindi niya ako kinakausap.. Palagi niya akong inaalagaan. Nauuna siyang gumising sakin ng 7PM para gawan ako ng breakfast (gy shift ako), after that, papainitan niya ako ng tubig kasi hindi ako nakakaligo pag hindi maligamgam yung tubig. Pag break ko, may snacks na nakahanda sa table ko, and then pag lunch ko naman, hinahatiran niya ako ng niluto niya for me. Lahat ng foods na ginagawa niya for me, laging may sticky notes sa ilalim ng pinggan: ""Thank you so much"" ""I appreciate you"" ""Wait for me"" ""I hope it's spicy enough for you, di ko tinikman kasi baka it's too spicy for me"" ""Hipon, your favorite!"" ""With every bit of fiber in my body, I love you"", iilan lang yan sa mga nakalagay palagi sa note, never siyang nakalimot na iremind ako na kahit ganon siya sa ngayon, mahal na mahal niya ako't inaalala niya ako. 

Kanina after shift, habang naliligo siya, bigla akong naiyak kasi narinig ko siyang kumakanta. After 2 months. Paglabas niya ng CR, nagtataka siya kung bakit ako umiiyak. Niyakap ko lang siya ng mahigpit. She thanked me again and told me how much she loves me. While smiling. God, I love her so much.

I HATE MYSELF,"F(16) I am feeling SO SO GUILTY right now. I impulsively 'pitik' (without any second thoughts, as if my hand acted on its own due to my emotions) my mother slightly at the back of her head after I was offended by what she said. She said, 'nananakit ka na ah' and kinda punched me on my shoulder. Her words HURT me, knowing that my father physically abused her before. I just want to KMS I FEEL SO GUILTY

But she also hurts us when she gets angry. I hate how I am becoming like them. I'm literally trying hard to control myself when I'm feeling overwelming emotions because I usually hurt myself but this time I JUST CANT.... : (

Pagod na ako sa sarili ko,"Di ko alam kung kanino ko sasabihin lahat ng 'to so dito ko na ilalabas. 

Bata palang ako alam ko na na may mali sakin. Madaming nangyari sa buhay ko na naging dahilan para maging ganito ako. From Emotional to Physical abuse, to Financial and s*xual abuse. 

It started with anger management issues, mood swings,disruption in sleep up to extreme forgetfulness. Yung sobrang makakalimutin ko and yung pagiging inattentive ko, yung pinaka malaking reason kung bakit nahihirapan ako ngayon. I can't even remember what I did today and even yesterday. 

Depression comes in and go sakin. Di ko alam kung kailan ako last na mawalan ng suicidal thoughts or kung kailan ako nagkaroon ng genuine interest sa mga bagay sa paligid ko. Di ko na maalala. 

Pagod na ako sa sarili ko. Ayoko na mahirapan gf ko sakin. Ayaw kong may mahirapan dahil sakin. Gusto ko na lang mawala na parang bula as if di ako nagexist in the first place.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/19bgytx/pagod_na_ako_sa_sarili_ko/,t2_r0ofwrjp,1705771919.0

my lola's friend caused someone's death.,"pa rant kasi parang ang hirap i-sink in yung mga nangyari. Mahaba 'to kaya please bear with me (pati na rin grammar ko, kasi indi ako magaling mag tagalog because I'm from Visayas)

So my Lola, (a teacher, retiring next year, and kapatid ng mismong Lola ko) has a friend which is a principal teacher sa isang public school dito samin. I met her many times before ‚Äî sa mga parties and dinner with subject teachers. Okay naman siya. She's nice and has good communication skills. I prefer her over sa 'bestfriend' ng lola ko na mala karen ang attitude.

Not until I heard sa radyo (2 days ago) na there's a maid. A 19 years old, who committed suicide. And I was shocked nung narinig ko name ng amo niya. It was my lola's friend.. the principal teacher. I thought nagkamali lang ako ng rinig.. but it was really her.

The girl committed suicide because she wanted to attend college but eto naman si misis principal.. she said awful things to her simply because she doesn't want the girl na mag-aral and umalis. She even threatened the girl na sisirain niya yung card niya in front of her and she will call the police to accuse her of things na nawawala sa bahay if talagang aalis siya.

And you know what's worse?

She cursed the victim, saying awful words directly at her na she will always be a maid and graduating college doesn't suit her, dahil belong daw siya sa bundok where her parents work as magsasaka.

I was stunned to hear this and akala ko baka gawa gawa lang ng mga witness but there's a video of it. A fucking video of them talking. I don't know kung nasan yung video but I heard sa radyo na they watched it‚Äî and they were so mad at the principal teacher for causing someone's death. Not because of physical abuse, but mentally, and emotional abuse.

At eto pa ha, her salary every month is 3k lang?? and yung cheap rice pa yung pinapakain sakanya. Minsan saging lang. Tapos sometimes she's asked to iron the clothes daw ng amo niya every 12AM-1AM like what the fuck? The principal teacher is fucking rich. Her husband and daughter are fucking lawyers yet ganyan yung trato sakanya?! how inhumane!!

The girl opened up to her boyfriend and messaged him na she will end things as she don't see any future na daw because of what misis principal told her. Her boyfriend rushed doon sa bahay where she's working. Her boyfriend found her hanging but she was still alive..

However, she didn't make it. When she was at the hospital, she was choking na daw which caused her death..


I don't know what and how to react.. but damn this is just so..

Hay, rest in peace.. shit the victim didn't deserve that : (((

Nakakalungkot talaga and I feel so sad sa nangyari. Sobrang naiinis ako kasi I used to admire this principal yet to know na eto yung nangyari? Gosh, she did not only kill the girl.. but the victim's dreams na maging isang ganap na teacher din and for her family.

Potangina talaga. I hope the family will get the justice they deserve : ((


EDIT: I apologized for using the word 'owner' instead of 'amo' pasensya na po talaga and thank you so much for the correction...

It has been 13 years,"It has been 13 years since I told my parents that I was seeing then my boyfriend, now husband. It started like a normal day and then after breakfast I told my mother and stepfather I was seeing someone. I didn't expect just how extreme their reaction would be. I know they wouldn't be too happy because they were very strict. But I was 18, a legal adult who was leaving home for university in few short months so I thought that was enough for them to give some freedom. My mother went berserk. She yelled at me, cussed me out and called me a whore. She hurt me physically over and over. She threatened my life. My stepfather tried to play the nice guy by supposedly calming my mother. But I heard him egg her on. He asked to speak to my boyfriend to end our relationship. I was terribly frightened and helpless. Just after 9pm on that terrible day, I had to leave home and stay with a friend because my mother threatened more violence.

That was the start of their campaign of terror which lasted until the end of August when they eventually kicked me out of the house. I've always been abused in that house but they really ramped up the physical, mental and emotional abuse during those few weeks. I didn't even feel like human anymore towards the end. They've worn me down and I thought I was the worse person in the world. A dirty, good for nothing, whore of a daughter. 

Every year I feel the pain. As the months then the days approach to what I coined the anniversary, I am stuck in a cycle of reliving the pain. Some years I don't remember but when I close my eyes in the night I'm back in that moment. 

It has been 13 long years. I'm 31 now. I live in a nice house with the same man and have a good life. But every year, I feel like a helpless 18 year old again. My parents said I would understand their actions when I'm older. I'm still waiting for that day. The older I get, I feel more confused about their actions and their desire to hurt me. 

I feel angry because people in my world have moved on and expect me to do the same. I wish I can. I wish it doesn't hurt and that I no longer remember.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/158ams0/it_has_been_13_years/,t2_8epaki6q,1690205112.0
Hindi ko nakikita sarili ko na mabubuhay lagpas 40.,"I just want to get this off my chest. I've been depressed since 2017 and started medication nung 2021, but I eventually stopped since hindi na  gumagana yung gamot. Isa rin sa reason is akala ko okay na ako kahit hindi naman pala haha false hope lang pala. I grew up in a family where I experienced emotional and physical abuse. As the eldest daughter, I have been through a lot. An emotional punching bag ng parents or sometimes punching bag. Gumanda lang relationship ko sa parents ko nung nag-study abroad na ako, which is sagot naman ng parents. anyways, I used to self harm to the point na nakita na ng parents ko dahil ayaw nila ako ipagamot.

Isa sa issue ko is hindi ko nakikita sarili ko na magpakasal or have a long term relationship. I am a very driven person at ang pinaka main goal ko ata sa life ay yumaman and travel kung saan-saan. Freedom ba. Actually naisip ko na if I ever date someone again in the future parang reason lang 'to para magstay ng matagal sa mundo. Pero hindi ko talaga nakikita sarili ko na tatanda with someone or tatanda in general. Gusto ko lang umabot ng 40 or 45 and then I can pass away. I want to die in a place where I will find peace, hindi na ata mababago isip ko. kung mabago man edi mabuti pero now this is something im sure na ill do. I have been through a lot and ayoko na patagalin buhay ko, ipupush ko na mangyari mga goals ko or maabot ito. Once na nagawa ko lahat ng gusto ko then I can finally cross the bridge.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/17i6erc/hindi_ko_nakikita_sarili_ko_na_mabubuhay_lagpas_40/,t2_45p30sa7,1698469063.0

I finally got the courage to seek professional help!!!,"After a year of trying, yes!!!! Finally!!! I was able to seek professional help na dahil afford ko na kahit papaano. When I was at my lowest, after my ex financially abused me, I was left with nothing. I had no adult to lean on. 

Parents were too busy and apparently mental health isn't that much of a ""thing"" to my boomer parents.

As panganay, naiintindihan ko naman yun at growing up, I'm just used to getting up on my own. May sakit? Bili ng gamot, magpagaling. Kung may kailangan ako at may gusto ko, I should know how to get it myself. I didnt get the assistance my sisters are getting rn--- and thats okay. Ako naman na nag bibigay nung mga hinahanap hanap ko sa parents ko sa mga sisters ko.

So biggest life set back ko talaga last year after my ex abused me mentally, emotionally, physically and mostly: FINANCIALLY. Lahat ng harm binigay sakin nun and up until now, I'm suffering.

So big step talaga saakin na nakapag seek na ako ng help. I was prescribed medicines to help me cope up.

I have depression, PTSD and *i forgot the other one*

(28F) Napakahirap growing up with an abusive father.,"The violent and sudden angry outbursts I witnessed since I was a child, yung mom ko battered wife due to his paranoia (napaka seloso), nakatikim kaming magkakapatid ng physical abuse kahit walang dahilan para ikagalit niya. Noon inisip ko tuwing ma tri-trigerred siya maging violent na sana mas mabuti pa walang ama kaysa ganoon, noong nilayasan namin siya ilang beses hindi na sana nakipag reconcile mom ko everytime na susuyin niya kami for the sake of not being called ""a broken family"". Eh di sana happy kami na wala siya sa buhay namin, may freedom from emotional harm at wala ng source of misery.

Mahirap especially as a babae ma re-realize mo na kaya pala na a-attract mo ay yung mga cheaters, uncaring, heartless partners kasi deep inside your subconscious yun ang alam mong ""love"" growing up.

My friend reached out to us for help. He wants a place to stay for a few short days and we agreed. But the problem is that his father might contact us. We might be blamed for protecting him.

He was raised by loving parents,"The guy I am seeing is a gentleman and very respectful. It turns out, I found out during our date he grew up in a household with his loving parents who have a healthy marriage. 

I grew up in a household where my parents marriage is toxic af. My dad would scream, throw things, verbally, and physically abuse my mom every time they have a fight. My mom would scream back too if they have issues. Sobrang passive-aggressive rin. Yon tatay ko naninisi lagi and hr never owned up his mistakes. He also accuses my mom of cheating but he is the cheater; Andami niyang kabit and body counts during his marriage. Hence, I grew up thinking it was normal to meet a guy who is a toxic masculine and misogonyst.

Mr. Bumble is the exact opposite. Open-minded, gentleman, respectful, and dislikes sexism/misogony. I asked him how his parents raised him and he said he never saw his father physically and verbally attacking his mom. Kapag may issue both parents, tatahimik lang and pag-usapan nang maayos. His parents never hit him physically as well. He said he wants to be honest to show how his parents raised him and nakikita ko naman. He also thinks his actions are normal for a guy and sabi ko sa kanya in my case, nagugulat ako kasi nasanay nga ako sa toxic abusive household. 

Sabi nga ng mama ko, mag-asawa ako ng lalakeng hindi tulad sa papa ko. I am glad my brothers are the exact opposite of my dad and they are similar to the guy I am seeing as well. I know bare minimum lang yon lalakeng respectful and mabait but I really appreciate it that may ganitong lalake pa pala aside from my siblings.

pinalayas ko na si live in partner,"23F pinaalis ko na si live in partner 24M. Gusto ko lang ilabas talaga. 3 yrs kami, almost. After a yr of our relationship, I found out na yung kasama niya sa bahay ay mismong immediate family niya. He told me na nakiki-stay lang siya sa tita niya and his cousins. Di ako nagduda kasi kami lang palagi yung tao sa house pag napunta ako. Di rin kami masyado nalabas kwarto pag gabi na, pag nakikita ko naman yung ‚Äútita‚Äù niya parang normal lang na setup lang. Hence, kahit may ounce of doubt ako‚Ä¶ di ko na pinansin.

 Then, I became pregnant after a yr of our relationship. Doon ko lang nalaman na mismong fam niya yon. I feel betrayed knowing na yung mga nakakasama ko sa bahay ay mismong pamilya niya na. He told me na kaya niya raw di sinabi ay dahil may trauma siya sa fam niya and he didn‚Äôt grow up with them. After 3 months after I found out the truth‚Ä¶ doon ko naman nalaman na kambal pala sila nung isa niyang kapatid during check up. Y‚Äôall would say na bat du ako nagtatanong or di ko nahalata. I did ask him lagi abt his family plus yung bat di ko nahalata na kambal ay because di ako natingin sa mukha ng mga tao pag nahihiya ako. Also, palagi rin wala yung kakambal niya so di ko na napansin. Then, I feel betrayed AGAIN.

So lumala na yung trust issue ko. Mind you I was pregnant during this time. Pag nag aaway kami every month, nananakit na siya. Kada pigil sa braso ko ang higpit. Umaabot pa sa tinulak niya ako sa salamin nila sa kwarto. EVERY MONTH. Umabot na rin sa point na nasakal niya ako at 8 months pregnant tas di ako makahinga. Palagi siya nags-sorry after na parang akala mo fi siya aware sa sarili niya.

Our child came last year and binago niya naman. Nag adjust siya. Just this yr 3x kami na nag away na may physical abuse nanaman. Una pinukpok phone ko sa tuhod nagkaron ng malaking pasa. Sinampal ako‚Ä¶ and just recently, hinampas ulo ko. Hinigit ulo ko palikod to the point na tumunog spine ko. Also, hinagis ako sa kama. 

Also, he‚Äôs verbally abusive. Tatawagin akong bobo mag isip lagi or bobo lang pag napipikon siya sakin pag nag aaway kami. Ang hilig mag gaslight na baliw ako due to my reaction sa disrespect. 

I know I should‚Äôve left since day one. Di rin naman ako dependent sa kanya to begin with. But now, pinalayas ko na. I hope I am making the right decision. Naiisip ko lang na what if sa iba pa siya tumino, parang nakakainggit lang sa part ko.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/182ribw/pinalayas_ko_na_si_live_in_partner/,t2_o37iffjn0,1700830580.0

Willing ako maging 3rd party para maka alis sa isang abusive relationship si crush,"me(M) has come to know a certain woman(F) at work let's call her crush, we just started at this company at the same time and throughout this period she'd disclose that her live-in SO of 4 months is an abusive narcissist who gaslights her on the daily.  


she's cried a few times during our mandated breaks due to this, she'd show me her conversations with her SO and it's just a mess of insults and accusations and this cycle repeats nearly everyday, we actually can't talk about anything else unless she's calmed herself down but we can talk for 3 hours on the phone without really running out of things to talk about. I am not the only confidant crush has with her situation as several co-workers of varying genders has been informed about it.  


for context about kay crush, pretty much a textbook abuse victim, I asked her if she has been physically abused and she's said her SO hasn't hurt her physically (doubtful imo). she keeps coming back to her abuser like most abuse victims do. Also has 2 kids from different fathers, and her current SO is actually trying to get her to have a 3rd kid. pretty sad situation in 3rd world philippines.   


from what I know  of her current SO, a 20-ish year old(so young) jobless dude who uses weed but is ""managing"" a family business I have no information about that also brings no money, this guy was crush's +1 on the office team building and he would frequently ogle my other female co-workers unashamedly in front of crush.   


Right now me and crush are pretty close and intimate(no sex, yet), to the point of her saying she wishes she'd met me earlier or getting jealous if I pay attention to other female co-workers and we are aware that this is cheating. I don't feel any guilt towards the guy, but my feelings for crush isn't healthy too, I want crush for myself but I can't make her dreams(wants a happy family with kids) come true because I'm planning to get a vasectomy this year and i'm not budging on my childfree ways.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/14oq1um/willing_ako_maging_3rd_party_para_maka_alis_sa/,t2_lv2me,1688309077.0
Sister bonds really make me envious,"I'm so fucking tired of being the emotional punching bag. Growing up, I have always let my older sister be, I never tried to create a bond with her kasi lagi niya akong sinasakit physically even though i am five years younger than her. I was a kid, and still inintindi ko actions niya as my older sister. I thought we'd eventually build a relationship just like any other sisters I know once we get older. But no, it just got worse. 

i just want to know where does her hatred of me stems from? I've never been one to fight back, sinusunod ko naman mga utos niya, i help her out when she needs help. Pero bakit? Bakit ang laki ng galit mo sakin, ate? She'd go home from school, see something na hindi ko naman kasalanan and still blame it on me. I know some of you will say, ""The oldest child has it harder"" but is that really a valid reason for her to literally verbally and sometimes physically abuse me? 

I've grown to just accept na ako yung emotional punching bag mo, pero sometimes it still hurts, you know? Especially kapag si Mama na ang nagtatanong kung bakit ba napakalaki ng galit niya sakin.

Take Action,"For context, this is about my friend...

Well... Ex-friend since siya na ang pumutol ng friendship namin.

It's about that guy who ended up showing his true self and screwed up alot of girls, inluding two women who became a special part of his life.

After days of talking to his victims and making them aware of their options, one of them finally had enough of his shit and went all out on him, calling him out on social media, on the groups he is in and pretty much every circle he is in.

This was one of his ex who we met up to learn about his actions. Turns out he gaslighted her, physically abused her, mentally harassed her and to put the rotten cherry on the top, he went on and added her as his contact for those loaning apps that he joined.

She (the ex) just went on all out on her account on what he did during their relationship. Nilabas na niya lahat ng baho.

For now, we are at the look out for what he may do, watching the situation very closely.

With this, I urge every man and woman out there, those who are abused in their relationship, to speak up and act accordingly. Sometimes, in order for the wheels of justice to start turning, you gotta turn it yourself. Kayo ang magiging susi para masupil ang mga kalokohan nila. Remember na if you remain silent, that means they'll take it as a leeway to continue doing what they've been doing to others. You are fighting not just for yourself but for those who they hurt and those who they may hurt.

I wish my sister an early death,"Pagod na pagod nako sa ate ko. I used to have a love-hate relationship with her pero now it‚Äôs just pure hatred. She was my first bully. Bata pa lang kami alam na ng lahat na malala talaga ugali nya, she used to be very physically abusive and now she‚Äôs more verbal but her being physical with me never stopped. I remember back then nung hindi ko na kinaya yung mga pananakit nya sakin nag sumbong ako sa my trusted adult pero nothing changed, instead she threatened me and called me ‚Äúsumbungera‚Äù. The ‚Äútrusted‚Äù adult didn‚Äôt even do much kasi miski sila mismo walang magawa sa ugali nya. She started providing for us kaya ngayon mas lumala na lalo ugali nya kasi whenever di nasusunod mga gusto nya, isusumbat nya lahat sakin. And the saddest part is i idolized her. I wish i could be as cool as her growing up kasi i guess you could say na i felt inferior besides her, i was insecure growing up because of her. She can carry herself to the point na pati mga matatanda kaya nyang sagutin and she‚Äôs an angel sa mga mata ng mga kaibigan nya or strangers. She was prettier than i was and mas matalino sya kesa sakin. That‚Äôs why i couldn‚Äôt stop myself from wanting to be like her. Kaya despite of endless abuse, i always defended her against the elders.

She always finds a way para ipahiya ako or to invalidate me and never even thought about apologizing. Never nya akong cinompliment for something that i worked hard for. Pero recently, i think i‚Äôm reaching my breaking point. I guess i‚Äôm not as submissive as i was tulad nung dati kasi the way she‚Äôs been treating me lately is more hostile than how it used too. She drove me to the point na yung suicide thoughts are being applied sa real life. Have tried many ways of ending myself pero would always wake up in bed alone, still in hell. Gustong gusto ko na umalis but i can‚Äôt kasi i‚Äôm a minor and tama nga sya, she‚Äôs my provider and wala ako ngayon kung wala sya.

Pagod na ko,"Sorry, I just need to breathe and at the same time not be judged. To give you a brief background, I came from a broken family. My Dad cheated on my Mom multiple times (with strangers and even with my Mom's so called ""friends"") and was physically and sexually abused too. Even my sister was sexually abused by him. Yung Mama ko ang nagtaguyod sa sinirang pamilya ng Papa ko, at nagpaaral sa aming apat na magkakapatid. We had little to no communication at all before sa Papa ko, not until nagreach out siya sa amin pero via messenger lang around late 2015. Pero Mama ko pa rin ang kasama namin at sumuporta sa amin hanggang makapagtapos kami.

Year of 2021, unfortunately, namatay ang Mama ko due to multiple organ failure dahil natamaan din siya ng covid that time. Tapos, yung Papa ko, ni hindi man lang umuwi to pay respect sa yumao kong nanay. Pero a month after my Mom's death, panay reach out ang Papa ko para sa death and burial benefit at ang pension ng Mama ko sa SSS until now dahil wala sa aming magkakapatid ang may gustong tumulong sa kanya na makuha niya yun (wala po siya nilabas ni singkong duling sa gastos kay Mama). Hindi po kasi sila nakapagpa-annul dahil mahal, kaya legally, kasal pa rin po sila at siya ang may right sa pension ni Mama lalo na't wala na pong underage sa aming magkakapatid. Pero matagal na may ibang kasama sa bahay ang Papa ko, mula pa nung tuluyan na silang maghiwalay year 2009.

Earlier today, yung kinakasama ng Papa ko, tumawag sa akin para kausapin at pagsabihan ako na nalulungkot ang tatay ko dahil daw pakiramdam niya wala na siyang pamilya dahil hindi namin siya nirereplyan o kinakausap halos at nakikiusap na huwag naman daw kaming maging ganon sa tatay namin lalo na at tumatanda na raw siya. Tulungan daw namin ang tatay namin na maging masaya at buong pamilya kami. Nabanggit niya rin na balak pala nilang magpakasal nung namatay yung nanay ko, pero naudlot daw dahil nagkasakit siya.

Na-caught off guard ako sa sinabi niya at hindi ko mapigilang hindi magalit dahil sa nalaman ko. Not only gusto niyang pakinabangan ang perang pinaghirapan ng nanay ko, but the audacity na unahin pang isipin ng tatay ko magpakasal ulit sa iba kesa bumawi sa aming mga anak niya? Sobrang nakakaputangina. Tapos ang lakas mang guilt trip, na parang ako/kaming magkakapatid pa ang dapat bumawi sa kanya dahil matanda na siya at nangungulila siya sa amin? Lakas din ng loob makapagdemand ng pera sa amin para sa mga gamot niya at pangkain at kung ano pa man, pero wala naman siya nung mga panahong kailangan namin ng tatay?

My brother (32) physically abused me (22) and sobrang naapektuhan ako kahit na one year ago na nangyari iyon. Nag-away kami dahil sa pera, ako kasi nagmmanage ng budget namin. Everyday ako nagsstruggle sa anxiety ko. Marinig ko lang footsteps, boses, at kahit naffeel ko na presence niya sobrang inaanxiety ako. Sobrang lumayo loob ko sakanya.

I want to forgive my parents but it's hard to let go of resentment ,"I had a complicated childhood. Physically present father but emotionally absent and was physically abusive. A mother who saw my father's abusive tendencies but didn't do anything. I remember there was this one point where I was in 2nd grade and I hid my exam papers because I didn't pass their ""required grade"" which is a perfect score. My father choked me against the door yung type na nakaangat na ako from the floor while my mother watched and encouraged him to do so.

I hold great resentment towards them. My childhood was full of fear. I would go to school black and blue and no one gave a crap. In high school, they started throwing things at me. I wanted to get emancipated from them. They were controlling, abusive, and the bad memories weigh the good memories. I think, the only good memories I have of my childhood was when I wasn't with them. 

I'm currently 22 and still in uni but I don't live with them. I live with my aunt and uncle and I haven't experienced any beatings since I moved in with my aunt and uncle which was when I turned 18. I do however get verbal abuse. I get called names, they would swear at me, they would threaten my life, they would slut shame me, berate, say derogatory things and belittle me.

Recently, they threatened to have my foreigner boyfriend killed if I continue my relationship with him just because I snuck out on my birthday to see my boyfriend. They told me to break up with him but I didn't.

Ever since I visited them, I ignored all their calls. I ignore their texts. I respond a day later. I just want to graduate uni and gtfo of here. Fuck the Filipino saying na ""Parents mo pa rin sila, sila lang ang mga tao sa mundo na mamahalin ka unconditionally."" Fuck that. AKO ang magmamahal sa sarili ko unconditionally. They don't deserve whatever success that will come my way. Hindi naman sila ang nagpapaaral sa akin ever since pa before. Fuck utang na loob, bayad na bayad na ever since I was born. I'm not their retirement plan.

I have had enough of them. Fucking mentally unstable parents, a mother who wants to pimp me out to old white men na mamimigay daw ng allowance at para suportahan ang buong pamilya ko, and at the same time slut shames me when she found out my boyfriend doesn't give me any allowance (he pays for everything and we've only started dating for a few months).

A father who tells me he loves me more than anything in the world and tells me I'm free to do whatever I want but keeps close tabs on me and dogshows me to his friends like I'm a trained puppy na ""Oh, buti pa tong anak ko, simula bata palang, tinuruan ko na to paano maging mabait"" No, I simply chose to abide by your rules otherwise I would've died.

I was raised in Mindanao, my mother worked in Luzon so it was just me and my father. I remember there's this one time, bumaba ako sa school rankings, I went from top 5 to top 10 and I got beaten black and blue for it. I would cry and scream for help and I remember he said, ""Kahit patayin pa kita, walang may pake. Madali lang kitang ilibing sa likod at walang maghahanap sayo."" He was right. No one cared. I tried to tell some people and asked them to call DSWD but they would guilt trip me and say, ""Papa mo pa rin yan. Mama mo yan. Anong gusto mo mangyari sayo? Maging ampon? Pasalamat ka nga may mga magulang ka, yung iba wala.""

I want to heal my childhood trauma and I saw that it starts by forgiving your parents. But I hold so much resentment, I hate them so much. I sometimes wish I'd have killed myself when they were happy with me, and write a suicide note saying I blame them. I'd love to haunt them for the rest of their lives.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1aw89ns/i_want_to_forgive_my_parents_but_its_hard_to_let/,t2_ch5pk0zld,1708508809.0
Im tired of being a nice guy.,"So many relationship ended up with me being second. I've met and dated many women, took most to dancing, courted and been in a relationship with a select few. Unfortunately all ended up leaving me(some even cheated). Gave them everything i could and loved them like their the only woman in the world. Learned how to do hair and makeup so i can relate. But sadly i learned the hard way that the phrase good guys always end up last is definitely true. Its hard to trust and go out there again. Sometimes i think it would be best for me to just be alone. They prefer someone that would just use and abuse them emotionally and physically. Now i wonder is there still a place for nice guys to get the girl and end up first.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/162yq2d/im_tired_of_being_a_nice_guy/,t2_dx7mzir0w,1693162643.0

I hate my boyfriend's fraternity. So. Much.,"I love my boyfriend so much but lately I can't stand his behaviour. His org, his fraternity, takes pride in their application process which involves psychologically hazing and hurling emotional abuse to its applicants. It also interferes with their acads which is already mentally draining to begin with. The whole idea is to break their applicants down psychologically, emotionally, and mentally so that they can see who can withstand pressure and will be worthy of joining their org. There's no physical abuse, but they are made to do physically draining tasks and military-like exercises. I know a lot of orgs do these kind of application processes, but that doesn't make it okay at all and his seems to be longer in duration and stronger in intensity than the average org. It's all so unnecessarily cruel. 

I hated this org when he applied, as I felt like it was putting so much pressure on him when he already had a lot of change to deal with. I hated to think that he was being shouted at, humiliated, forced to do tasks that he would normally be embarrassed to do; plus there was so much to do that it took away a substantial time that could have been used for rest or to study for acads. To the point that he would get physically sick from exhaustion. All in the guise of creating a support system and friends. 

Now that he's no longer an applicant, but a facilitator,  it's all so much worse. How could he be okay with shouting at his juniors? Making them do embarrassing, tiring, menial, and at the same time physically and emotionally draining tasks. To the point that some of the applicants break down or self harm themselves to cope with the pressure. How could he not see the hypocrisy of wanting to be each other's ""family"" but the same time hazing these people? I hate it. I hate knowing that he is capable of bullying, and worse that he can't see that it's bullying. He is justifying all of it; that it is necessary, effective. I hate the self righteousness of it all.

I can't hide my emotions (no poker face at all) so he can always tell that I am not thrilled when he tells me about his org activities. I am trying to be supportive and understanding so as to avoid possible arguments but I just can't yet control my emotions. Yet I can't be open about it as much as I would like,  how much I hate this org, because he LOVES this org. He LOVES this org so much. It is his support system and barkada. How could I possibly take that away from him?? 

So I am left to swallow my comments, my thoughts, and my judgement as often as I can stand, so we won't fight about it. 

Tonight however I feel like I might explode from frustration so let me get this off my chest, PH.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/162u822/i_hate_my_boyfriends_fraternity_so_much/,t2_i1n45wjls,1693152056.0
Nauulol ako every time dominant yung bf ko,"My boyfriend is a very soft person. Very golden retriever energy, sunod sa gusto ko most of the time, napakalambing, napakahina ng boses, napakamahinahon, naiiyak over the littlest of things (like pag namimiss nya ako or hindi kami nagkausap for a huge chunk of the day kasi busy kami both) ‚Äî overall, a big baby.

But sometimes, when he's being protective over the people he loves, he becomes dominant. Just like nung time na naging physically and verbally abusive yung LIP ng younger sister nya, tinrashtalk nya yung lalaki tapos hinamon nya pa sa suntukan. He made sure pa na his younger sister was safely removed immediately from the house they were living in. Sobrang touched ko noon kahit hindi naman para saken yung ginawa nya.

Today, nagalit siya kasi binabastos ako ng isang friend ko (let's call him P) but I didn't know how to respond to P kasi he's a VERY close friend of mine and sanay na ako na bastos talaga siya na tao kahit kanino. Parang part ng personality nya maging bastos. Sasabihan lang ako na, ""Joke lang yun"" when I respond with seriousness. In the past week, mas lumala yung kabastusan niya maybe because tinotolerate ko din tsaka dinidismiss ko yung inappropriate jokes nya as being part of his raunchy personality. I already expressed kay bf na ayaw kong ginaganon ako pero di ko alam how to respond properly talaga without harming our friendship. Sabi nya na siya na daw kakausap kay P, pero sabi ko na wag kasi I want to deal with it on my own.

Sinabihan ako ni bf today na, ""Wala kayong pag-uusapan this week or some time soon,"" tapos sinundan nya ng, ""I'm not asking."" If hindi daw titigil, siya na daw talaga kakausap. Sabi nya pa na 'wag daw talaga magpapakita sa kanya ulit si P (they've met several times before) kasi baka mabugbog nya daw. Ewan, naulol ako sa pag-command nya saken. Gusto ko nalang sabihin, ""Yes daddy,"" tapos lumuhod sa harap nya or kumandong sa kanya pero alam kong sobrang inappropriate non for that conversation kasi serious na usapan yon. I know I can do that on my own naman talaga kahit hindi nya sabihin, pero my feeling of not wanting to talk to P anymore was validated nung sinabi nya yon, kaya mas na-empower ako to stop communicating with P.

As someone who's been very dominant and independent all her life, nanibago ako sa feeling na 'to. Kasi all this time I thought I wanted someone na submissive saken, pero nakakabaliw pala when someone's being dominant over me. Ang sarap pala sa feeling na ikaw naman yung inaalagaan, hindi yung ikaw lang nag-aalaga palagi.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/13oo6e3/nauulol_ako_every_time_dominant_yung_bf_ko/,t2_9tsta101,1684754793.0

Physically, Mentally, Emotionally Abused. Nakakapagod pala magmahal ng tao sobrang taas ng standards. I am with a guy for almost 20yrs and we had 2 daughters.

Business provides what we need on a daily basis but not enough sa mga wants and dreams. Everytime maalala niya yun andyan ba magaaeay kami sasabihin niya na wala ako kwenta at wala ako alam. Tanga, bobo at inutil. Andyan na sasampalin ka, suntok, hampas, dura kasi sinagot mo siya. Wala daw ako pangarap kasi masaya ako sa kung ano meron kami. Andyan yung mangbabae siya. Pilitin ka makipagsex sa iba kasi yun ang fetish niya. Ang dami. Hindi ko na maisa isa. At sasabihin deserved ko to lahat.

my bf is still seeing his ex gf behind my back,"I'm 19(F). May boyfriend ako, bago pa lang kami ng boyfriend. Mag one month pa lang kami next week. But, a few days ago may nag chat sa akin thru pm. She introduced herself as the friend of my boyfriend's ex. They told me that I should not tell my boyfriend about it. I asked her what's the problem. She told me that my boyfriend used to physically abuse her friend which is my boyfriend's ex. Hindi agad ako naniwala. I ask for proof first. So they created a group chat. Doon inamin sa akin nung ex niya na they still seeing each other. She sent me proofs, such as their pictures together and conversations screenshot. But the screenshots are a bit sketchy since all of it was cropped. When I ask her about the physical abuse, she immediately changed the conversation and told me that she is not ready to share about it. I respected that. She is very pushy with me, gusto niya malaman kung ilang beses kami mag meet up nung boyfriend ko. And when I told her that I don't wanna tell her anything. She got pissed off. Doon na nila ako inaway nung friend niya sa gc na they created. They keep on telling me that I should not believe my boyfriend. They are mad that I don't want to believe them. I confronted my boyfriend about it. He send me proof that the pictures are from last year. And he said sorry and that he loves me. When we had our first date my boyfriend warned me about her ex. That her ex girlfriend used to that everytime he is with a new girl. But ever since that day, I cannot fully trust my boyfriend. I don't want to break up with him, because I am already attached. I am convincing myself that maybe this was just a test to our realtionship. I've been crying myself to sleep these past few days because I am overthinking everything.

Forbidden Perfect Love üíîüíî‚òπÔ∏èüò¢üòîüíîüíî,"So I (32F) have a bf now (31M), and napakabait ni bf as in. Sobrang match kami pati ugali namin in all aspects except religion (he is INC, I'm Catholic). Physically, both are good-looking naman. Ugali naman, parehong mabait. Intimately, sobrang magkasundo din kami (my late hubby doesn't like to have sex with me kahit I have that body na gustuhin) 

But here's the catch, he's 2 years separated no communication (pinagpalit sya and hurt by his wife emotionally and sometimes physically) but can't annul his wife since INC sila. He holds on to his faith with INC so much. Di nya kaya matiwalag. 

Nga pala, alam naman ng both families and relatives relasyon namin pero except sa church nya at sa pamilya ng asawa nya. As for me, maaga ako na biyuda kaya wala naman problem kung magpakasal ulit. Both kami never pa nagkaanak. My life was already full of challenges. Emotionally abused ako sa marriage ko and looks like si Lord ang gumawa ng way na makawala ako dun. And many more. 
Tapos ngayon, nakilala na namin ang isa't isa, sobrang pagmamahal nabibigay namin for each other. Masaya sya kasi kahit mataas pinagaralan ko (I'm doing PhD, he doesn't have bachelor's degree) and mas mataas ang estado sa buhay, I never looked down on him and I always have high regards for him. 

Mahirap iexplain kung gaano nakakahinayang yung love na papakawalan ko kasi alam namin na di na namin makikita yun sa iba. 

Btw, I chose to stay kasi sa ilang beses na muntik na din ako mamatay (lapitin ng accidents kasi) at nung December nabundol naman ako ng sasakyan, at sa dami ng obstacles na nalagpasan ko, I feel like I deserve na makuha yung love and happiness. 

Nakakalungkot we cannot be together because of so much complications ng batas ng tao at batas ng relihiyon niya. 
Pero kung tutuusin, wala na kami masasagasaan na tao kasi wala kaming anak, at wala na kaming ka relasyon. 

Please don't comment hurtful words, medyo nadedepress na ako at the moment. Sabi kasi ng friends ko hiwalayan mo na. Although sabi ng mga older colleagues ko, give it time.

Idk how to cope with this,"
I (m19) a good son and a student. Like every parents could ever dream off. But still im not perfect human being. For background . So my aunty (F50) she got no kids just mainly her life revolves around helping our family and being a corporate slave for god knows since when she started being one. As we all expected from her. Shes really strict and got a high superiority complex attitude. To the point where i have to tell my friends i should be at home by 6 or else my whole family especially my brother whos the golden child.  (M23) i dont really care tbh who happens to be a controlling coward and a manipulator would be calling my ass off. He would mentally abuse by gaslighting me for not being a good son and mainly rebellious by staying late and lying. Well he do the same. For the side note. I go to my friend‚Äôs house just to escape from my aunt and mainly the household.He would sometimes physically abuse me for talking back inshort defending myself. Because he always been exaggerating about everything just to make sure he got it all right. I became not really close to all of them. I left my religion and open up to islam. they didnt support me but wanting me to die. I dont really know im so close from ending myself. I felt like i cant find a partner or be in a relationship. If my family would be like this.  They always say that ill be the one taking care of them once they got old and shit. Which i dont really like. I cant live up with this kind of thing. Idk for how long i can endure this because im so close to ending myself.

My mom‚Äôs friend raped me,"

I was raped when I was 18 by my mom's friend, and when I was 20, I told my mom about it. My mom has been my trauma since I was a kid; she has physically and verbally abused me since I was a child because I think she  despise my father so much. So back to the topic I told her na I was raped nung 20 na ako pero ewan ko di nya ata ako pinaniwalaan and now I‚Äôm 23 and I accidentally open her account kase nagbakasyon sya dito sa condo namen ng husband ko and unang una kong nakita na magka chat pa din sila nung lalake na nang rape saken, all this time pala di nya ko talaga pinaniwalaan and super sakt for me kase pinatawad ko na sya ng buong buo sa lahat ng pambubugbog nya saken dati and I even support her financially until today kase may sakt sya pero kaht naman nung wala pa syang saket lahat lahat ng kinikita ko sa modeling and work ko napupunta sa kanila nagtitiis ako dito sa manila just for them ng mga kapated ko sa province, She never treated me as her daughter pala talaga lalo na siguro kung wala akont nabbigay na pera sa kanya . Sobrang saket talaga lalo na nasa kanya trauma ko , dahil lang talaga sa kapated ko kaya di ko sya kina cut off sa buhay ko naawa ako sa baby brother ko which is 9 yrs old pa lang kc nakikita ko din minsan na verbally abuse sya, gusto ko na ngang kuhain un pero di naman ako mananalo sa batas kase sya pa din nanay and half sister lang ako.

I want to end it...,"Hi guys, I'm 24 and I'm clinically diagnosed with MDD, Anxiety, and Body Dysmorphia. 

Lately my week has just been going downhill. I always suppress all my feelings and never letting them out. Growing up, I've been emotionally, physically abused, and sexually molested by my own father. My family is very toxic, not supportive, and always brings me down. My parents are annulled because my father cheated with my mother's sister. We live here in our grandparents house w/my tita and tito ever since they got annulled. 

I've been hurt and betrayed so many times by the people I loved. It hurts me that some people have the AUDACITY to gaslight me into saying ""pinaparamdam mo na wala akong kwenta"", even though I've been honest with them and never broke their trust. 

It hurts how they can easily say that to me. I never make other people feel unwanted and unworthy, because growing up and until now I STILL FEEL and RECIEVE that treatment from the people I love. 

Lately I've been thinking of ending it all. I think that I'm doing those people a favor if I did end everything. 

I just want to be loved, cared, and appreciated. That's all I've wanted ever since.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/yzkelb/i_want_to_end_it/,t2_j5fs3nxr,1668887383.0
I'm stuck here abroad because of my own stupidity,"Me(33), my *suspected narcissistic* wife(28) and my son(1.6) are currently staying here somewhere in North America. We've been married for almost 2 years.

I went here with my wife hoping that she would change. Hoping that she would compromise and finally show efforts na ayusin family namin. I paid everything, inayos ko yung apartment, she's now trying to either get a job here or get a student permit para mag try ma PR.

Bago pa magpunta dito, ilang beses nya na sinabi na maghiwalay na kami at wag ako sumama (after ko mabayaran plane ticket and all). That was a 2 days before our flight. But ako si tanga, nagpupumilit ayusin at naghohope maayos marriage namin and sa pagaalala ko sa anak ko na wala naman sila kasama dito bukod dun sa friends nya na nasa same apartment. 

But nope, same thing. We've been here for about a month now, and I'm still being verbally, emotionally and physically abused. To the point na ilang beses na ako pinapauwi. Dati sa pinas, sya yung nalayas sa bahay namin every away and all. Binubugbog din ako sa Pinas, pinpahiya sa social media, nakipag date sa iba and possibly nakipag landian na sa iba while kasal kami. Toxic sobra. Controlled nya lahat. I have a 4 year old daugther na naiwan sa pinas (from my previous relationship), na hate na hate nya. Ni hindi ko matawagan kasi pinagaawayan. Tang ina sobrang tanga ko nga talaga. Ano na ngyari sakin.

Under the saya ako tang ina, ngayon ko lang narerealize sa kagustuhan ko palagi na maayos at mabigyan ng buong pamilya anak ko nagpapakatanga at under na ako sa lahat ng gusto at pangaabuso nya.

Kung tutuusin hindi naman kailangan tong mangibang bansa eh. She's doing this for herself. For her future. Maganda work ko, earning more than the average salary ng mga citizen dito, working remotely. We have a house, we have a car, I bought her own car and lahat ng luho at pagpapaganda na gusto nya binigay ko. I dated her sa ibat ibang bansa. All I want is for us to live peacefully but for the last 2 years, ngayon ko lang nakikita lahat ng selfish decisions nya, mga pang aabuso, mga pang gagaslight nya, mga panloloko at panlalalaki. Parang kahit anung salin ng tubig gawin ko, butas yung baso nya. Nothing is enough.

Siguro naubos na yung hope sa puso ko this time. Nawalan na ako ng amor. Ganon pala yun, gigising ka na lang isang araw, wala ka na maramdaman, nag ccrave na lang puso mo na mag start ng bago. Wala na ako pakelam anong baluktot na kwento gagawin nya para sirain ako sa tao at sa social media. Gusto ko na mawala sa buhay nya, simulan annulment process at umuwi ng Pinas. 

Ang lamig dito, walang kotse, boring na tas ganito pa kasama mo. Kung wala lang dito anak ko uuwi na talaga ako. Ngayon dahil sa katangahan ako at sunudsunuran sakanya, stuck kami dito. Hindi ko pwede itakas anak ko dahil need ng consent nya. Palagi nya ako pinapauwi na ng pinas at kaya nya na daw ng anak ko dito. Hindi nya daw ako kailangan. Palibhasa everytime makikipaghiwalay sya lagi ako nakikipagayos at hinahabol at sinusuportahan ko lahat sakanya. Makikita nya this time as soon as makauwi ako na kasama anak ko.

May ipapakilala na nga sakanya yung agency na kausap nya (marriage set up  ata or something). We are still on a tourist visa, and may mga plan syang mag cash job. Di ko alam kung meron way itawag to sa immigration para pauwiin na kami dahil wala naman valid visa to stay here longer. Kung tarantado lang ako, tinawag ko na sa pulis to at pinakulong pag saktan uli ako physically eh.   


Paguwi ko ng pinas, hihigop agad ako ng mainit na sabaw ng bulalo. I will hug my daughter, and I will spend time with my family, my dad, my mom and my brothers na sobrang nalayo na din ako the past couple of years dahil sa asawa kong ganito.

karesperespeto padin ba ang mga sex workers??,"Hi guys I would like to open a topic since sobrang sama Ng loob ko and hoping somehow this story telling might help some girls or boys out there who suffer on the same circumstances as me. Hi I'm 18 yrs old and I'm a sex worker. 
 How did it begun?I was a streamer on an app when I was 16. Galing ako sa break up with my first boyfriend. I made the decision since he ask me if I wanted to do porn. I was very much offended at that time and somewhat close minded. But I know that time that my worth is more than that. Time has passed and there are lot of things in my mind but I decided to keep on going. I did streaming and luckily earn money to it. Wala kaming wifi nambuburaot lng ako sa mga viewers ko for load. Syempre while streaming Hindi maiiwasan ang mga nsfw offers like sending of pictures. I felt pressured dahil expectation Ng parents ko is Malaki sahod ko. That upset me and push my self to stream non stop to the point na Wala akong tulog and ung pahinga ko sa cp is 3 hrs. Nakaranas din ako Ng pananalita while streaming. Nababato ako Ng gamit and nasasampal. Maliit lng bahay namin understandable pero ung pananakit nila and pag sigaw is kind of out of the league na. I have trauma when it comes physical abuse. Ung mother ko I think have suffer from post partum and lagi syang Galit sakin napapalo ako even small things. I felt not normal at the times. Akala ko I'm a piece of shit lng walang silbi and all of that. Back to the story, I tried to have worth and so work not to mention I have epilepsy. Nakabili ako Ng mga bagay na gusto ko and totoo nga Minsan nakakasilaw Ang Pera. Nung walang Wala nako nag start ako mag benta Ng nudes. Nung nakita nila na may hawak akong Pera medyo naging Mabait sila . As a daughter to them I sometimes give money to them and buy groceries pero Hindi namn araw araw pasko mag mga times na nga nga tlag and so I decided to be a walker or prostitute. Pumasok ako sa ktv sa timog and doon ko nakita na may mga graduate pala Ng 4 yrs course and nag end as prostitute dahil sa hirap Ng Buhay. 
My problem is my mother and brot5dont respect me anymore. Ung kapatid Kong lalaki binubogbog nalng ako at inaambahan while ung mother ko sinasabihan ako Ng napakadumi ko daw. I'm afraid to be treated like a shit eldest child the way how my mother treated her eldest sister and my father being treated by his younger siblings . So my question is is being a sex worker still deserve to be respected? Sorry guys nalilito na Kasi ako I was thinking to do suicide SInce ung family ko is treating me like a shit habang tinutuwid ko ung sarili ko",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/z518ha/karesperespeto_padin_ba_ang_mga_sex_workers/,t2_p42o1i01,1669447327.0
How I ruined my Ex's life for Getting with my Best friend,"**\[LONG POST AHEAD\]**

&#x200B;

First of all, I already know maraming magagalit saakin, perhaps because masyadong harsh ang ginawa ko. TW lang sa mga mambabasa, this post will contain sexual harassment, physical abuse, and religious CULTS.

SO, my first ex boyfriend and I began dating noon high school pa, precisely 8th grade. We dated for almost 4 years until niloko niya ako sa best friend ko. I'll call her ""A"". Noong una, sobrang perfect ng relationship. He was my first boyfriend and akala ko my last. I would say very low maintenance ako that time, tipong kahit hindi niya ako binibigyan ng bulaklak during Anniversary namin or Valentines, presence niya was enough for me. Naintindihan ko rin ang situation niya since noong una palang sinabi na niya saakin ""mahirap lang kami"". This is because Typhoon Yolanda severely affected his family (he grew up in Tacloban ) financially and naghirap sila. Prior to the typhoon his family wasn't financially stable na rin. So mas lumala lang ang situation nila, tapos madami pa sila magkakapatid. This explains why kinailangan niya lumuwas sa Maynila at mag aral. Matalino ang ex ko, like no joke. I studied in a well known private school in Manila, perhaps the whole Philippines pa. So to be a scholar there was a big deal. He excelled in everything, ma-pa sports or academics, which explains why na in love ako sakanya. I didn't give a single F kung mahirap siya, I fell in love with his intelligence, passion and ambition for success.

Fast forward to my 12th year of HS (4 years later),  biglang nagiba ang ugali niya when he entered college (he was a year above my grade level so nauna siya mag kolehiyo.). I was so confused and frustrated kasi 3 years consistent ang princess treatment niya saakin. He got physically abusive to the extent na wala na sa lugar. Pinapahiya niya ako in public, tipong sisigawan ako sa harap ng maraming tao. The first time he abused me was when sinampal niya ako. And not like yung mahina na sampal, but yung tipong FULL FORCE na sampal. Imagine, I am a 5'2 female and he's a 5'8 male na slightly malaman ang physique -- not to mention main sport pa niya in HS was volleyball. Sa sobrang lakas ng sampal niya I fell to the ground and nagka pasa ako sa face for one week. For most girls, the first thing they would do is makipaghiwalay, diba? Kaso, t4nga ako that time. He apologized and comforted me after this incident and nagsinungaling ako sa parents ko na natamaan ako ng bola sa mukha during intrams. I let it go because he apologized profusely and nangako na it would never happen again. But of course, it DID happen again. Multiple times in fact. I was 18 years old at the time pa.

Months later, I received a long message from him, stating na gusto na niya mag ""repent"" sa mga ""sins"" niya saakin. Nakipag break siya saakin. He joined a church, which I later found out was a cult pala. Sa cult na ito may ""quota"" sila, like how many people they could recruit to their church. They would get praised pag na reach nila ito. Dinamay pa niya ako sa kulto niya aaaah! And as expected, it was a living hell. In this Church you were monitored most of the time, dating was prohibited without the approval of the pastors and you had to take an oath na kailangan mo ibigay ang life mo sa church (ang reasoning nila is because Jesus did the same for God). Despite being in the church though, patago kami gumagawa ng indecent acts. The slightest physical intimacy was ABSOLUTELY prohibited but ginagawa pa rin namin sa likod ng mga sisters/brothers/pastors. Not gonna lie, at some point I was genuinely committed to serving the Lord, but it was so difficult for me to stay ""holy"" when my ex would pressure me to do indecent acts with him. Sobrang hypocritical niya, yung ip-pressure niya ako makipag talik pero the next day he would be preaching about staying holy until marriage. Like what the F! And yes, technically break na nga kami but I thought wala lang yon because he still treated me like his girlfriend.

Bob0 kasi ako, akala ko kami pa. Kaso, he started showing interest kay ""A"" and completely disregarded me. He began pursuing ""A"". *For context*, ""A"" was my best friend sa church. She was sweet, intelligent and kind. My ex met ""A"" through me and naging bff din sila because they go to the same University apparently. When my ex began pursuing her yung money na hinihiram niya saakin (but hindi naman binabayaran) ginagastos niya kay ""A"" for flowers and gifts. The audacity. Although, habang nililigawan pa niya si ""A"" saakin pa rin siya pumupunta, perhaps because of the uncertainty. As a T4nga, hinayaan ko lang. I thought if I treated him better pipiliin niya ako. Umabot pa sa punto na  nagmakaawa ako na ako nalang. *Wa epek*. When pinayagan na siya ng pastors to pursue ""A"" he ghosted me completely and avoided me in Church. Sa harap ko pa siya nag ""Will you be my Girlfriend?"" kay ""A"" at a special Church event. P0ta!  After niya ako paasahin, gawing sugar mommy and Fbuddy????

**Ito na ang exciting part**, I had so many mix emotions like heartbreak, frustration and anger. Mostly anger. Because I felt used and manipulated. So, sinabi ko kay ""A"" everything, that we were doing indecent acts, na ginamit niya ako, na kami pa when we entered the church and LEFT the Church. When I left the Church I gave myself some time off and decided to forget everything nalang. UNTIL narinig ko na my ex completely twisted the story and pinagkalat sa Church na I was the one pressuring him (huh?). Sa sobrang nandilim ang paningin ko I decided plotting a plan how I could completely ruin his life. Since pilit nag mamabait other sisters/brothers ko sa Church I would frequently message them, acting all buddy buddy, pretending na I am completely oblivious sa mga pinagsasabi nila behind my back. Praise the Gods my OG akong friend sa church (who eventually left din) na chinismis saakin na my ex sexually harassed ""A"". Hinalikan siya ng walang consent ni ""A"" and also pressured her frequently to do indecent acts. Their relationship went downhill from their because nag sumbong si ""A"" sa pastors. HA! I put this information to good use and pinagkalat sa University niya of what he did to ME and ""A"" (without uncovering our names). I anonymously posted sa Freedom Wall ng University niya and name dropped him. Like, name, batch and course pa. I exposed how he was an abuser, predator and manipulator. Inexpose ko rin ang darkest secret niya, na nanonood siya ng child hentai (which is technically child p, diba?). Nahuli ko sa gallery niya na he had hentai vids and pics of sexualized versions of child anime characters (like yung mga white blood cells sa Cells at Work anime). Alam ko, na b0b0 ako for letting this slide, but he reasoned na they were just drawings. Huh? Anyways, when the post gained enough attention I deleted it to cover my tracks. A week later, my ex's friend (who eventually became my friend na rin) informed me na my ex was being completely alienated in campus hehe. Receiving dirty looks, anonymous threats, and getting bullied almost. A month later nagpost siya sa FB na he felt unsafe sa campus and had to drop out and needed financial support from his ""brothers and sisters"" in Church. I know ang sama, but sobrang saya ko when I read that post. The thought na I had ruined his reputation sa University niya, relationship and Church ... sensational.

Also, if you're thinking about his family, I also took care of it. I told them everything via messenger na ginawa niya saakin and they were on my side. Sabi saakin ng sis ng ex ko (close ko rin) binugbog ang  ex ko ng father niya when he came home for Christmas sa Tacloban for being ""kahihiyan"" and for ruining his future. THANKS TITO ILY!

&#x200B;

PS. Also, I know dapat I should have been the matured one and walked away nalang para walang gulo. Sabi nga nila, God forgives even the greatest sinners. Unfortunately, for my ex, hindi ako Diyos.

I hate how co-GenZs friends reacted and looked down on my dream about being a good mother/housewife,"Idk if this is a right sub pero nakakainis hahahaha. 

I really don‚Äôt get the amount of hate I got from my friends when I told them na I want to be a housewife, be a good mother figure and create a cozy family pag napag-uusapan yung ganap sa sarili or plans in future sa catch up. Napatungan pa ulit when my friend screenshot yung repost ko sa tiktok which is vid about family, dating, marriage na nakacollage ganon. Ako naman medyo matagal ako mag check ng gc and grabe na flood na nung nakita ko. I know it‚Äôs supposed to be a joke to jump with but I was hurt. They be like, ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt relate‚Äù, ‚ÄúHirap magka-anak teh‚Äù, ‚ÄúYung pinaiyak ka sa nursing tas magiging nanay ka lang‚Äù, ‚ÄúSi **** puro repost ng ganyan.‚Äù 

Medyo na-off lang ako kasi I thought I‚Äôm already in supportive friend group since I cut off my old friend group last year. Ano bang meron? Ano bang masama sa pagiging housewife? Funny how most of them are self-proclaimed feminist but doesn‚Äôt tend to support their co-female dream, I mean I‚Äôm not being forced naman eh, I don‚Äôt get the hate ba‚Äôt pinagtatawanan eh choice ko yun. I want it. I WANT IT SO BAD.

I grew up in chaotic family, I don‚Äôt have a father figure, I was raised by my alcoholic and physically abuser mother (she died early) then passed on to my grandparents. I always envy people who have a complete family simula bata ako. May pangarap rin naman ako to be a nurse, I‚Äôm doing great sa academics but having a complete and happy family talaga pinakadream ko. Minsan natatakot ako kasi baka matulad ako sa mother ko, iniiyakan ko yun pag nag o-overthink ako sa future pero I know to myself na I will try my best to treat them like how ng grandparents treated me. I want to have children na mababatayan ko so they wouldn‚Äôt feel lonely. I want a loving husband. I want to be a supportive and loving mother/partner. 

Hayyy. It‚Äôs just so hard to expressed feelings like this nowadays kasi napupuno ng back flash. Please mind your own dream. If you think yours is superior, good for you but walang madaling pangarap. If you don‚Äôt wanna get married, have children, that‚Äôs fine but please don‚Äôt judge people who want to create one.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1ak4c8s/i_hate_how_cogenzs_friends_reacted_and_looked/,t2_t2o6wc46i,1707204826.0
I already feel numb at this point,"TW: Physical abuse, emotional and verbal abuse

Hi Reddit.

I‚Äôve been contemplating writing here, but I have a lot of thoughts right now and I just want to unload.
Kakauwi ko lang mula barangay. I tried to find out the best legal ways I can to file a case against my biggest abuser - my brother.

I started the fight tonight. Nagparinig ako na medyo malakas kasi for the nth time in a row, kinuhaan na naman ako ng gamit. I‚Äôve had enough. We live in a compound, nakatira sya sa ibang unit, ako nakatira sa mismong bahay namin. After nya ako marinig, he came barging in with the item he stole and shouting ‚ÄúMay problema ka ba?! May problema ka ba?!‚Äù then he grabbed me by my neck and threw me outside. I didn‚Äôt want to fight, I know that if he inflicted more damage to me, he‚Äôd be more in trouble, and alas, as I was trying to go inside the house again, he was stopping me. At one point he punched me multiple times that I lost count. I‚Äôm already numb with the pain. I have been hit by a baseball bat when I was 16 and a monobloc chair when I was 17. I‚Äôm now 30, but things haven‚Äôt changed.

While the commotion happened, my mom just watched. She didn‚Äôt stop my brother or anything, she just watched at the side. She just watched me being punched and kicked. I grew up in the same way. She wasn‚Äôt really the best parent, as she coddled my brother saying ‚Äúaway kapatid‚Äù lang yun, but I still love her. Even when she blamed me for being diagnosed with cancer when I was 14, I still love her. She said na magastos, at naiinis sya dun - I get her though, she‚Äôs the only one working in the household. My dad was an alcoholic, a gambler as well. My brother followed his footsteps. Thankfully, my lola helped me with therapy. Pero you know, what set apart my dad from my mom before he died? He actually defended me. He saw me getting hit by the monobloc chair from earlier and he defended me. Sadly, even if he was battling cancer that time, my brother picked up the broken pieces of the chair and hit my dad the same way he hit me, and things were peaceful for a time dahil pinalayas sya ng dad ko, kaya lang my dad died eventually and my brother used that ‚Äúopportunity‚Äù to come back home.

We weren‚Äôt really on good terms ever since. He physically hurt me multiple times since I was 6. Verbally abused me as well. But what I can‚Äôt really fathom is the fact na nung pandemic, nung 2020, winithdraw nya yung buong retirement fund ni mama - nearly half a million pesos - and it was all gone. My mom didn‚Äôt know that my brother was getting all her hard earned money for months, pero eventually pinatawad nya, kasi nagdala ng pancit nung umuwi after nya makuha yung pera. Ako? I cared for my mom when the pandemic hit, even if nawalan ako ng income that time. I tried my best, but what did I get in return? I heard my mom say to me ‚ÄúSana hindi ka na pinanganak, sana hindi ka na naging parte ng pamilyang ito!‚Äù when all I did was serve her canned sardines because that is all that I can afford.

I am numb at this point.
I have to get a medical examination later for my scars at sa mga onting bukol sa mukha ko.
My best friend heard the commotion, and recorded the audio all while it was happening. We have evidence.
But personally, weirdly, I‚Äôm stoic right now.

Para bang oo, binugbog ulit ako, pero it‚Äôs like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm disappointed but not surprised.‚Äù The only insult he can throw to me is ‚ÄúAno lalaban ka? Bakla ka kasi!‚Äù

At the end of the day, I try to be the best human I can be. I volunteer for a non-government organization helping out people in need. I know that I am loved by my peers and that is enough for me. I have a job now that gets to sustain me. I have achievements under my belt that I never knew I could accomplish. Irregardless of my sexuality, I am living my life trying to help those who need it most, and the people who stand by my side, and I am happy with that.

He may hurt me outside, but he cannot reach the light I have inside.
As much as he hurt me, he helped shape who I am today.

A fighter.
A survivor.

And at the end of the day, I‚Äôm okay with that.
Ika nga, the best revenge is living your best life when your abuser is living (or gonna live) the life he deserves.

I‚Äôll be okay.
I‚Äôll do things the right way. I will fight the right way. Not through fists and force.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/191ssmp/i_already_feel_numb_at_this_point/,t2_jgbvr4tl,1704740288.0
toxic household,"punyeta. 

punyetang buhay to, wala na kaming ginawang tama. gusto ko nalang mag suicide, gusto na namin mag suicide para lang maparamdam sa kanila na sumosobra na sila. kaso ang unfair bakit kailangan pa namin kunin at i sacrifice buhay namin just so they can realize na hindi na tama ginagawa nila? 

verbal abuse araw araw. naturingan kayong honor student pero sa mga simpleng gawaing bahay ang bobo niyo. napaka baboy nyo. laging over the belt. 7 years na kaming ganto, wala pa ring bago, gusto na naming sumagot at lumayas kaso mahirap lang kami, hindi pa namin kaya mabuhay mag isa. napaka unfair kasi lahat nalang sinusumbat samin, kami nagpapa aral sainyo, puro utang na loob putangina, kapalit naman unstable mental health at suicidal thoughts. 

kapatid ko nagbabayad ng kuryente, wifi, at tubig, pension naman ni mama sa renta ng bahay. pero kung makaasta sila parang wala talaga kaming ambag ni singko. 

nagbigay sila ng gadgets sa mga kapatid ko only to restrict them from using it. kailangan mo pang magmakaawa para lang makuha mo or magamit mo cellphone mo, sana hindi nalang sila nag bigay jusko. kasi ang gusto nila lagi silang may power over us, it has always been like this for 7 years na. nagka trabaho na kapatid ko which is good pero hindi pa rin nila ma appreciate kasi feeling nila nag mamalaki na, kapag hindi naman nag treat o tumulong sa gastusin sa bahay sasabihin nagsasarili. ganito kami lagi, hindi namin alam saan kami lulugar. lahat ng gagawin namin may nasasabi sila, nakaka drain na sa totoo lang. 

isang mali lang dito o isang sagot lang sa kanila, nagtthreat na sila agad na lumayas na kami. napaka manipulative and controlling. 

simpleng bagay lang na kinuha yung cellphone para magamit sa paggawa ng assignment sa school,¬† muntikan nang ma physical abuse. hindi mo alam kung mag aaral ka pa ba o ano. ayaw naman namin mag rebelde sa school kasi alam namin na kami rin ang mahihirapan in the future. kaya kahit ang hirap mag aral, tinitiis namin dahil ayaw naming ma jeopardize future namin, ganiyan kami ka practical. 

grabe pano pa ba namin titiisin tong gantong ka toxic na household, sa totoo lang gusto ko nang lumayas kaso alam kong hindi ko rin kakayanin at kawawa mga kapatid kong maiiwan. 

hindi kaya nila narerealize na yung mga verbal abuse na ginagawa nila sa amin atsaka pang gagaslight nakaka apekto sa mental health namin? kailangan pa ba talagang umabot sa itthreaten ko sila na bawiin buhay ko para lang magising sila na tao rin kami? may nararamdam rin kami?

I want to expose you ‚Äî ex for 7 years,"I have an ex for 7 years, we were college sweethearts. I was 18 back then and he was 21 or 22 i think. My major is business ad while he was taking veterinary that time but unfortunately hindi sya nakagraduate ng doctor. Last year nya dapat sa vet pero nagkaroon sila financial problem and yun parents nya hindi na sya sinupport. Dun na ko tumulong sa kanya financially. Pero hindi sya pumapasok sa class nya. Nagsorry sya sakin that time pero alam mo yun parang di sya nagbago? 

Now, before we broke up it was my finals exam. Btw, nagtuloy ako ng law and he knows na sobrang demanding ng law school. Pero throughout my journey sa law school lagi sya nakikisabay sa exam ko. Dun ko na narealize na ayoko na pero hindi madaling break up ung binigay nya sakin. Chinat nya relatives ko pati siniraan nya ko sa mga girls na kinausap nya habang hiwalay kami. And ngayon may new gf sya tapos finflex nila isat isa sa social media. 

Wala naman sakin if magkagf sya agad habang pinipilit nyang makipagbalikan sakin. Pero un trauma na naiwan nya sakin ang nahihirapan ako. He physically, mentally and sexually abused me. I have a restraining order against him after break up kasi sinaktan nya ko physically and nagpunta sya sa apartment and ginulo nya yun gamit ko. Hindi ko sya tinuloy na VAWC kasi iniisip ko un stress din na madudulot sakin since i was also diagnosed of Major Depressive Disorder with Anxiety. 

Alam nyo masakit sa pagiging victim? Yun trauma naiwan sayo pero yun abuser mo andun masaya na parang walang nangyari. 
Sinabi ko to sa family nya and dun sa girl ginawa sakin with documents pero walang naniwala mas matapang pa yun girl. May piangsamahan naman daw kami. Ganun terms, which is dialogue ng ex ko kasi malakas syang mang gaslight.

We are so fed up of our dad,"He never fails to ruin Christmas and New Year eversince we were a child. Even the simplest celebration, he always makes a way to ruin the joy of it by drinking too much then verbally and physically abusing my mom. This already gave us a deep trauma. He doesn‚Äôt even care. Even his grandchildren are already having a trauma.

He still doesn‚Äôt realize why the hell we didn‚Äôt want to celebrate any occasion at home anymore. We are so fed up. Me and my siblings told mom to leave him alone this coming new year. Or just leave him there alone forever. We are willing to find a separate place for mom and the kids (my OFW sibling‚Äôs kids).

He is a narcissist. He blames everyone about any bad thing except himself. He will always choose other people over his family. He will side with the people who did bad things to his family. He is an extreme people pleaser. He is hypocrate. He is very pretentious. He is toxic. There is no peace everytime he is around.

We already did what we can to adjust for him. Tried to talk to him when he is not drunk, but too egoistic to talk about the issue. When he‚Äôs drunk he will open it up but you will never ever understand him (because he‚Äôs f*cking drunk).

We are so fed up. He is a hopeless case.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/18ska22/we_are_so_fed_up_of_our_dad/,t2_40hyu5etu,1703735445.0
I'm still healing,"I didn't realize how bad it was until it was over. You don't think it will ever happen to you until it does. He was verbally abusive, would scream at the top of his lungs, gas lite the fuck outta me, and tried to become physically abusive. 

I left the day he threw me from the door to the couch after I broke up with him asking for another chance I only made it out because I had it ready to call the police and showed him I would call if he didn't move from by the door and let me leave.

He followed me to the car stood in front of it and hit it once before I hit call and put it on speaker he ran back to his place. I left so the police never came. 

This guy was going into the military so I told him while he was in basic. I was going to move to Utah for college and go to school. He ended up getting into an accident and getting a dui so he could not go anymore. He expected me to cancel my plans and stay and when I told him no, he accused me of leaving the state so I could leave him.

Now almost a decade later happily married with a baby and I realized how much he messed me up.
I would constantly check in with my husband to make sure I wasn't doing anything wrong as soon as I felt like I disappointed him I would cower waiting for the yelling and name calling slut shaming.

My ex apologized to me years later and was mad that his apology didn't garner the response he expected. I have you blocked how are you even contacting me sir!!!!

I still find myself sometimes falling back into those behaviors and then I'm reminded that's no longer me so I don't need to wear those wounds anymore

Female abuser,"There this psychopathic ex of mine na sinasaktan ako physically and verbally dahil lang sa mga tamang hinala or pagiging selosa nya. Mind you, ex status na kami at siya rin tong currently that time ay active sa bumble at ako hindi. 

Nagseselos siya dahil lang may nakakausap or I was just being a nice colleague sa mga kasama namin. Nasa med field kami so majority babae. May time na nakatabi ko lang yung isang babae kong colleague sa lounge while I'm watching a series tapos bigla siyang mag cchat na ang intimate ko daw with her. I dont even fucking know my colleague's name that time. 

Tapos pag i coconfront nya ko she always verbally accused me of something na hindi ko naman ginawa and pag nag init ulo nya due to her overthinking sasaktan nya ko. 

May time na pinagsasampal nya ko then nung natalsik salamin ko (I wear a glass) bigla na kong napikon so I pushed her away to stop hurting me its just that nag land yung both knees nya non kaya nagka pasa and she took a photo of that as evidence at pinapakita nya sa lahat para ako yung mukhang abuser and mas madali maka convince na abuser ang lalake kesa babae. 

May time rin na she's confronting me while I'm driving and she punched me sa likod ng ulo ko 4 to 5 times. During those time sobrang nag iinit na ko pero I controlled myself dahil I'm driving. Pero nung time na yon my hands felt numb and ang blurry ng vision ko. 

Her abuse's been going on for almost 6 months now. May mga kaibigan na ring nadamay sa problema namin at syempre kakampihan nila or mag side pa rin sila sa babae while they label or spread lies about me making me as the toxic abuser guy. 

All I want for the both of us is peace. How many times I tried to make amenments pero siya tong insisting na gusto nya exclusive kami, gusto nya sa kanya lang ako pag kami ang nag uusap. 

I always received  hate messages from her. Blaming me ;  Saying na ako yung sinungaling at ako yung manipulative. It hurts a lot dahil siya yung nagmamanipulate sakin dati pa by threatening me na mag suicide siya pag di ko siya kinakausap o pag di ako pumayag na maging kami ulit. She always fooling me around rin na nag iimbento siya ng mga bagay just to control me.


It's hard to be abused in this world lalo na pag babae abuser mo. Pag lalake ka, need mo pang i justify, i prove, mag collect ng decent evidence just to be heard of. Pero di pa rin guaranteed yung help, sympathy at justice dahil ""lalake"" ka at nasa Pilipinas ka. And in the end of the day you're just a low life sad boy asking for pity.

Ang sakit na magwalk out sa isang toxic relationship,"Alam mo ung love mo ung person pero alam mo sa self mo na pag nafall ka ulit sa ‚Äúpromises‚Äù nq magbabago siya, uulit nanaman ung cycle ng emotional and verbal (sometimes physical) abuse. I decided not to accept ung pakikipagbalikan nya kasi sobra na kong nasaktan at napagod sa lahat ng effort ko na di naman nya naappreciate. Parang kahit anong gawin ko, mali, nakakainis, hindi enough. Ang sakit marinig

 Anyways di lang kasi ako makatulog kasi baka part of me nagguilty na kahit nageeffort naman sya recently eh ayaw ko parin. Kaso sa time na tintry nya ayusin nag away nanaman kami (take note di pa kami okay) so ano na????

Sobrang totoo pala ung phrase na ‚Äúsometimes love is not enough‚Äù kasi kahit gano mo kamahal ung tao, mapupuno at mapupuno ka rin talaga. Siguro fault ko na rin kasi binottle ko lang pero everytime nagaaway kami before, lagi ko naman cinocommunicate ung frustrations ko pero it always fell on deaf ears.

Stop procreating!!!,"I've been hating my life for the longest and suicidal. 

Here's why, 
Mom and dad is not emotionally matured enough to raise a loving family. 
My dad ended up cheating leaving my mom in misery, Became an OFW to support us. 
Our oldest brother end up being a criminal, My Oldest sister became the head of the family since dad no longer with us and mom is abroad. (She was just in 3rd year college btw) 
My other brother who is 5years older than me plays the victim role and the bully alternately. 
I am the punching bag. 

- I grew up having a conflicted personality coz I always need to be conscious with the way I behave, They are easily irritated and gets angry. My childhood years was like walking on eggshells, constant fear and anxiety. 

- I thought that my emotion never matter since I am always invalidated growing up. 

- We were poor and my sister needs to sacrifice her studies for us. 

- My sister lived in with her partner, I end up living with my brother which was hell. I always cry at night, He screams at me all the time and verbally abused me, Physical abuse was also present. I thought all families are like this. 

- Present- I am now 29, living faw away,  No plans to get married or have kids,  Why? I still have all the traumas in me. I still hear voices in my head. I have issues socializing, I still cry, I dunno bounderies, I am so hard on myself everytime I fail on something. I even caught myself repeating the behavior of my brother to my colleagues. I feel so mentally fucked up in life. 

I am writing this to whoever may read this to please THINK a million times before you procreate. 
Ask yourself if you can give your child a complete loving and supportive family, Financial support and emotional support. 

You might not see the bigger effects of this neglects yet, but try to dig deep why there are psychopaths, sociopaths or increased with  depression cases,  uproductive prople of the society etc. 

I am speaking from a perspective of a neglected child who constantly fights depression, traumas and urge of wanting to k*ll someone/myself. I never wanted to be born anyways. What choice do I have coming to this world.

I want to break up with my partner of 7 years,"We‚Äôve been through college together and are almost done with grad school. Been through almost every struggle together, in school or personal.  I preface this by saying my partner comes from an abusive household. Some verbal abuse (and sometimes physical, usually throwing things) has happened at their home, and I‚Äôve even been an audience to some at times. My partner has also been verbally abusive to me during fights during the past years, which he has honestly been improving  and changing significantly on.

&#x200B;

A few months prior, we had a huge fight that resulted in me calling it quits. Things got quite ugly. It started as screaming in my face, begging, crying. Then when I rejected all of it, things got physical ‚Äî not at me though. They started harming themselves in front of me which didn‚Äôt amount to much (just a few scratches, thank god). I've put the trigger warning so I won't go into detail, but it involves a certain kitchen tool and household cleaning product.

&#x200B;

I‚Äôve honestly been fucked up ever since. I didn‚Äôt confide in family until last week (I‚Äôve lived apart from them since 2015), and only one of my friends knows about all that happened but they live very far away. I can‚Äôt hear a knock on my door without fearing they will burst through or start screaming at me. This is the first time they‚Äôve ever done anything remotely physical, but I‚Äôm scared it wont be the last. I‚Äôve since moved to a new location  and never told them about it (they don‚Äôt know where I live now, but it‚Äôs still really close to where I was prior so they could easily find out if they asked around). I want to break up with them, I just don‚Äôt know how to do it without potentially being  physically hurt.

&#x200B;

Thing is, they appear to be a model partner in public spaces. Everyone knows them as the funny and smart guy. They always post us when we go out to have dinner, and looking from the outside they really look like the model partner. They have connections that can get me to a great career path too. But I want to break it off now, regardless. None of my graduate school friends know about the incident, because news spreads quickly and I don‚Äôt want to ruin his future. But it‚Äôs really jarring to think how crazy he can get behind closed doors like that.

I don't get it!!!!,"I don't get why people seem to EASILY throw their relationships away despite the shallowness of the fight/problem. Gets ko yung mga malalaking problema like cheating or physical abuse, ayun, talagang hindi katanggap tanggap yun.







Pero yung mababaw na away lang na kaya pa naman sana ayusin o pag usapan, sabay itatapon nalang yung relasyon bigla at maghahanap ng bago... yun ang di ko ma-gets. Pagdadaanan at pagdadaanan mo din naman sa ibang babae/lalaki yan. Lahat naman talaga ng relasyon may misunderstandings, eh. Ngayon, nasa sa inyong dalawa nalang ng partner mo kung gusto nyo patagalin o ipaglaban.







Natritrigger ako. My last relationship ended because of shallowness and selfishness. I didn't want to end it but what can I do? Gusto na itapon e. AYUS AYUSIN NYO MAKIPAG RELASYON PARANG AWA NYO NA. 







Para sakin, nakikipag date ka sa isang tao kasi potential syang asawa. Ano yun, pag kasal na kayo, onting away, hiwalay agad? Napaka hihina ng quality ng relationships ngayon. Otherwise, if you don't have a plan to marry that person, then just fuck him/her. Make sure lang na PAREHO kayong nagkakaintindihan sa set up nyo. GIGIGIL AKO!!!!




EDIT: I didn't expect that this post will have a different POVs and versions. When all I'm trying to say is that the relationship nowadays are so easily to end. Seems like everything became so fast paced. Others will break up without even trying to fix it. Everybody's patience became low. Some married people are here as well. Na imbis ayusin problema nila sa mga asawa nila, maghahanap ng landi sa reddit at sa ibang platforms. But who knows, baka nga talagang malala na. Thank you for sharing your POVs.

Told a student that it's okay if he does not come to school anymore,"
I'm a teacher. Now, I had a Grade 5 student named ""Nico"" (not his real name) na sobrang disruptive sa klase. Parang little version ng mga siga sa kanto. Mahilig maghamon ng away, mahilig gumawa ng mga kalokohan during class, and mag - ingay.  

So you could imagined how stressful he is during classes for teachers. Madalas ko siyang masaway at mapagsabihan.

Then kanina, while ihahatid ko na yung Grade 5 students ko sa gate ng school to be fetch by their guardian, he was being rowdy again sa classroom pati sa pagpila. 

I am stressed and tired kanina but I know it's not an excuse why I said these words, ""Alam mo, okay lang sa akin kahit hindi ka na pumasok sa school"".

Then Nico replied, ""Ayaw mo na sa akin teacher?""

Maybe it's my imagination but I could hear some sadness in his voice when we he replied to me. 

Then I suddenly realized the meaning behind my words that I said without thinking. And I thought to myself, what the hell am I saying sa isang 11 years old na bata? To think, I even know his history. 

Nico has been the problem of the teachers ever since pumasok siya sa school namin so I already knew him kahit hindi ko pa siya nahahawakan. His father is in prison for being a drug pusher and as a young child, he was exposed to verbal, physical, and mental abuse from his father according to his previous adviser. I've even heard that he was abandoned by his mother.

Kaya I really regret my words but I was not able to retract it or played it as a joke kasi talagang nablangko ako and the next thing I knew nasa gate na kami.

Maybe he'll forget the words I've said to him kanina, maybe it's really my imagination when I heard the sadness in his voice and he doesn't think it's a big deal. Nevertheless, I will assume he is hurt by it and I need to make amends with him on Monday.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/12kp24c/told_a_student_that_its_okay_if_he_does_not_come/,t2_vpj5hn4v,1681392179.0

Here in the US b·ª©t terribly depressed.,"As the title says I‚Äôm here moved here in the US not too long ago, leaving all my friends and adoptive family behind to look for a job so that I can sustain myself and my future family. I know I cannot complain, I‚Äôd be ungrateful if I did, but right now there‚Äôs just this huge empty feeling in my chest. I cannot stop crying whenever I miss the Philippines. 

America has its own culture, one where I cannot or I don‚Äôt want to understand. Especially living in a red state where guns are legal and education is considered insignificant. Sometimes just walking down the street or driving makes me fear for my life.  Life here feels like a competition, you always have to one up the other otherwise you‚Äôll get looked down upon. They‚Äôre just so angry sometimes. 

Even staying with my family is making me so sad. My parents are here, luckily they don‚Äôt stay in the same house as I do, but every time I see them, my trauma resurfaces. We don‚Äôt have that familial connection. They have sacrificed their family for work, work, work, and work. That we never had a relationship. Both verbally abusive parents (though separated, thank God, well dad is both verbally and physically abusive) still breathe down my neck, not letting me pursue the career that I want. They act like they own me even I after I already finished my degree. 

 I feel like there is no purpose for my life. I will be stuck at a career I never chose for myself. I don‚Äôt talk to anybody about this because it sounds so ungrateful. I have little to no money, n√µ emotional support, no one to rely to, no one to ask for guidance, no beaches here, no scenery, nothing to ease my anxiety or depression. I‚Äôm so homesick.  Sometimes I really don‚Äôt see a way out of it. I want to live my life, I don‚Äôt want to sacrifice all my time to work like they expected me to.

Anyway, never nagbigay yung tatay ng anak ko since buntis ako. And now, nasa japan na sya engaged sa isang pinay. it's been 7 yrs since ive been single and raising my baby on my own. my son is turning 7 soon.. 

Nahuhurt ako kasi nag aask na anak ko about sa dad nya. 2mos ago ata nagsimula. basta, plan ko sa isip ko was to lie and say he's dead as a joke sa friends ko (ever since ha- ive been scared of this moment so pls dont judge) so nung nagtanong anak ko for the very first time, una wala akong imik sa sobrang shocked, kasi akala ko mga 9+ yrs old pa sya magtatanong. Tas bigla ko sinabi ""he's dead"" as a joke. (usual inside jokes namin ng anak ko kaya di sya naniwala talaga) response nya was: no youre lying hahaha etc. 

Anyway sabi ko nalang i dont know. tas nung inask ako ng anak ko, kung patay na ba talaga, sabi ko no.

long convo pa yun, pero yun yung gist. Umiyak ako after that. Parang relief na natapos na yung kinakatakutan ko. and gave myself a pat on the back for not lying but also saying the truth while not hurting him

Anyway, yesterday, nag ask nanaman sya. sabi nya, is my dad in the (insert a random country here - but not japan) sabi ko no he's not there. he was never there etc

end conversation.

naiyak ako after kasi, iniisip ko sa sarili ko, paano ko ba sasagutin mga tanong nya without hurting him and also not lying..

i grew up in a broken family pero daddy ko was living with us in the house and nanay was abroad married to someone else.

So kahit papano, di ko masyado naramdaman yung pagiging broken kasi andyan lagi daddy ko.l physically and mom naman is andyan for financial. 

Anyway, magulong magulo talaga family ko so i chose to leave and live on our own. 

baby daddy doesnt have any plans on giving financial support. also, he physically, verbally, emotionally abused me when we were together+ cheated on me + binaliktad ako sa side nya so it didn't end well. sobrang lala talaga.

Also, he's a toxic parasite sobra. kung pwede lang syang ierase sa memories ko. Wala rin syang pakielam sa anak nya. He lives like he doesn't have a child sa japan.

Anyway,

di ko alam paano ko ieexplain sa anak kong mag 7 yrs old palang. Di ko alam paano ko ipapaalam without hurting and without lying to him.

Alam mo yun, gusto kong sumigaw. i feel so hurt for my son. Im really lost. Im so heartbroken for my child. I don't want him to feel unwanted and unloved. But at the same time, pag nag lie ako, magagalit sya sakin eventually paglaki nya. and I don't want to tarnish his childhood for a lie sa walang kwenta nyang tatay.

shock absorber of the family,"people would say you'd get homesick being away from your family to study in uni, but it's the opposite for me. 

&#x200B;

it's mentally exhausting to live in a toxic household and to live with someone who has the capability to hurt people. 

&#x200B;

the scar that my brother left may have physically healed, but the trauma still lingers. oo, maybe I was at fault when I was a kid for being stubborn. but siguro naman di ko deserve to be physically abused and pagtuunan ng galit just because makulit ako. na ginawa akong human punching bag. as I grew up akala ko desensitized na ko sa anger issues nya. but what happened last night proved me wrong. 

&#x200B;

nakakapagod and I hate it na hindi ko kontrolado kapag nagkakaroon ako ng panic attacks everytime naririnig ko syang nagkakaroon ng episode. he would trash the house and scream at people when he's angry. I've always lived in fear that he might hurt people when he do, and lalo na, na baka ako ulit. all I could do is cry, cover my ears, and wish that he'll eventually stop. 

&#x200B;

kaya siguro ganun nalang takot ko whenever I would witness people arguing na I think would lead to them having a physical fight. di ko maiwasan na kabahan, manikip dibdib at di makahinga. the very moment when I was little would always replay at the back of my head. I hate that it will possibly haunt me forever. 

&#x200B;

as someone who hates it when people can see me vulnerable, I locked myself in the bathroom last night in hopes that I could shut out the sound of him screaming at people and releasing his anger by wrecking everything that he sees. wala e, I need to act like it doesn't bother me, na what he's doing triggered my attacks again. kahit anong gawin kong pagtakip ng tenga, naririnig ko pa rin sya. kada suntok nya sa gamit, naaalala ko yung nangyari. imagine coming back home tired from acads and other personal shit, tapos yun pa madadatnan mo. I've reached my breaking point and I guess naghalo halo na yung pagod ko that I've broken down. at one point, I did wish na mag pass out nalang kasi hinang hina na ko. I thought that if that's the only way I could rest, then so be it.

Extremely tired,"//tw ahead ig, suicide and abuse

Siguro mentally deranged lang ako (18), or sobrang iba interpretation ko sa buhay. I've been verbally and physically abused, lately pag napapagalitan ako I get this inch of fear sa family ko even I'm used and doesn't really care. I'm on my own, mostly on my own since I'm not supported on anything anymore, walang pake sa gustong passion na laging mino-mock, every movement or action seen as stupid or wrong. When I wanted to work to finally become independent and leave this shithole family, my uncle kept pushing me to stop because ""wala kang pupuntahan, hindi ka aasenso sa buhay."" Yes, abusive yung household ko, my mother (trans, once male now female) saw hurting as a way of discipline dahil ganun din sila dinisiplina. My cousin let her (or his, idfc and I disrespect trans-people. HOT TAKE but they're very angry all of their life to someone) anger out on me by hurting me, and family members feel happy about it. Another cousin loved mocking me, making me emotionally and mentally silent losing the passion I love when they're around (her family living in when my grandmother died).

Earlier, I just had some nonsensical thought I told to my bestfriend: ""hurting someone as a minor isn't abuse but discipline, hurting someone as an adult is abuse or violence."" I know I had my wrongs, but as a younger teen years back it's taking all over me knowing and scared na baka maging stuck buhay ko sa kamay ng nanay ko na sobrang strict, which I disrespected so badly dahil di ko nagustuhan yung way of discipline niya. Growing up religiously and graduating from the same catholic school I used to study in, I'm starting to lose my shit that ""maganda school mo, tinuturuan ka ng maganda bakit hindi ka ganyan,"" doesn't reflect to the abuse she's done.

Wanted to commit suicide back then, aunt ko naman was happy seeing the cuts on my arms telling me na ""sige mamatay ka na ayan naman gusto mo."" Never ko siyang mapapatawad, and wala akong pake sa uncle ko na laging sinasabi na ""pamilya lang kaya mong takbuhan."" Kahit na na-experience na lahat ng uncle ko, never kong babalikan pamilya ko knowing na mentally and emotionally I was abused. Knowing my friends helped me more to recover, kahit never ako pinapatuloy sa bahay nila dahil ayaw ng magulang, they did a better job talking to me more than being berated by my uncle na imbes na kausapin ako. And FUCK. HIS. SMUG. SMILE. for every sentence, sobrang mocking.

Please, gusto ko na lumayas sa bahay na to, I'm tired na tiisin yung bullshit control nila, kung pwede lang sana sa ibang pamilya nalang ako inadopt na di tinago yung katotohanan at mas tinuring akong pamilya kesa maging retirement plan na big bragging machine sa ibang family members.

i dont think i can love anymore,"i‚Äôm turning 20 (F), and i‚Äôve only had one boyfriend ever. i am (or was) bisexual, so not feeling any affection nor attraction for anyone is scaring me.

my ex-boyfriend was abusive. for a 14-16 year-old, ang abusive niya. he forbid me from talking with any guys in my class, would take my phone from me, smash it sa sahig pag ayokong ibigay (or kahit magaway kami), and SAd me, verbally abusive, and threatened to k-ll himself if I broke up with him. 

the pandemic helped a lot with the breakup because he had no physical contact with me, and it was easier to not fall for his traps, however, i think the experience scarred me. 

i tried, pretending to be kilig sa isang tao, acting like i like someone (sa ibang people lang, not sa person na yun mismo, ayoko namang makasakit.), and basically fooling myself na nagkakagusto ako sa ibang tao. 

as i said, i‚Äôm bi, so not feeling anything for neither man nor woman is scary. maybe i havent met anyone? pero now, i also just cant see myself with other people. i cant see myself loving someone, getting married, having children. 

i‚Äôm scared to not love, i‚Äôm so scared. i want to love and be loved, pero i think it‚Äôs impossible now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/166yul7/i_dont_think_i_can_love_anymore/,t2_8j1n01ydd,1693547987.0

I (24f) ended my 10 years on-and-off relationship with my ex (22m),"Just wanna share with ya‚Äôll since I can‚Äôt talk to other people what really happened (I am embarrassed). 

We started as a childhood sweetheart, we were each other‚Äôs first. We did have crazy stamina for sex, we get each other jokes, and you know, even if didn‚Äôt say anything with each other we know what each other wants and needs. Then High school came along, he cheated multiple times and we did broke up but we kept on coming back together. 

A little background for my ex, he came from a very chaotic family. His father used to do drugs, is a drunk and used to physically abused him when he was a child. 

Fast forward to 2021, we got back together after 3 yrs of separation and I have never been happier. I really thought it will be the last time and will settle down, we actually lived together till December of 2023, that‚Äôs when sht went down. He supposed to go home on December 18 from academy, but his mates told us that they all go home on December 17, so we all panicked since he didn‚Äôt even bother to contact us. December 18 he went home, then told me he don‚Äôt want to continue the relationship, bcs he doesn‚Äôt want to put me into that hell he he had another ‚Äúepisode‚Äù (He is depressed and tend to self harm) I said to him that I am okay and I can handle it the next time it happens, but he didn‚Äôt want to. So for 2 day, I kept on begging him (I really love him, I can‚Äôt see myself without him).

We just cried day and night and also sex. Then the time comes that he had to go his auntie to stay there till Christmas. Then he told me ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt face you anymore without feeling guilty.‚Äù I asked him what did he do? ‚ÄúI cheated‚Äù with whom? ‚ÄúWith my mate (male)‚Äù what did you do? ‚ÄúWe kissed‚Äù 

And it hit me, maybe that‚Äôs why he always cheated bcs he can‚Äôt find the comfort with all the girls that he cheated with.

Then a week ago (January 20) I found out he has a new girl. He always stalks me on tiktok but then blocked me. i deleted my fb and messenger and also twitter just to have a little peace of mind. I just don‚Äôt see why I had to go through with all that pain, now I will start again, but this time I will make sure we will never go back with each other. Even if the thought of growing old by myself is a pill that is hard to swallow. 

I resigned on my previous job since I can‚Äôt get out of bed without trying to kill myself, I cant sleep and drink or even take a bath. It‚Äôs been more than a month since the break up, but I can say that I am almost okay to take care of myself again, little by little.

as a tired friend na akisma,"pagod na me maging available sa friend kong tumatawag or mag chachat lang pag nag away ng jowa nyang abuser. she has a history of depression and she said parang it's coming back dahil dito sa jowa nya na di nya kaya hiwalayan kahit ginagawa na syang punching bag physically and emotionally. she'll call when im working kahit tambak na ako ng workload kakausapin ko muna sya ending mapapa OT ako pag ok na sya she will not reply to my messages asking if how's she doing na. 

this morning while im asleep, nag chat sya and pet peeve ko talaga ang mga nag chachat ng walang context or tatawagin ka muna sa chat.  pagod na pagod ako sa work this week dahil 3 nag resign sa amin so bigat ng workload isang week 2-4 hrs OT. so tulog pa ako mga teh nagising ako ng freaking 5AM dahil sa tawag nya pag sagot ko umiiyak na naman ang gaga. this time, nag sorry ako dahil gusto kong magpahinga dahil ako pagod na pagod na rin ako sa life and wala naman akong mapagsasabihan so di ko na kaya pa mag accommodate pa ng problema ng iba.

most of my friends are like that. ako pa mag aaya sa mga tropa ko pag may isa kaming friend na sad but pag ako nag aaya sa kanila na di ko sasabihin na ""kasi malungkot si ganito"" no one's available. very relate ako sa certain lyrics talaga nung song na Maps na ""I was there for you in your darkest times
I was there for you in your darkest night. But I wonder, where were you? When I was at my worst down on my knees. And you said you had my back. So I wonder, where were you?""

All of my siblings have failed their marriage.,"Di ko alam kung matatakot na ako mag-asawa or what. (medyo long post)

As mentioned, all of my sisters (3) have failed their marriage.

1st ate, notorious babaero at mayabang yung asawa. She suffered a lot in that relationship, aminado naman siyang hindi siya perfect na asawa. Meron silang 1 anak and ngayon legally married pa rin sila but yung ate ko nasa abroad while yung lalaki andito pinapaaral yung anak nila. He's a good provider naman to their daughter and he respects our parents. Mama at Papa pa rin ang tawag pero meron na rin siyang ibang babaen dinedate. He even treats us to a family outing last week.

2nd naman. Physically abusive yung napangasawa. Lately lang sila naghiwalay. And then my sister got her revenge, she had affairs for God knows how many man. It's not something to be proud of. Muntik ko na siyang itakwil because naapektuhan at natrauma yung mga bata sa ginawa nilang mag-asawa. But now, mukhang at peace na sila na hindi na sila magkasama and my sister's raising her sons on her own.

3rd sister. She's not legally married. Nabuntis ng maaga, iniwan ng asawa di sinusustentuhan. May ka-live in naman na bago, they've been together for more than a decade already. Tbh when it comes to relationship, siya yung parang mas maalam. Pero recently, naghiwalay na rin sila because babaero rin ata. Naging alcoholic naman 'tong kapatid ko and she's seeking therapy.

Me and my brother (4th) sibling. Eh hindi pa nag-aasawa, mukhang mauuna pa naman ako. Inaaya na ako ng kasal ng bf ko (1yr and 6mos together). Pero I'm hesitant not just because di pa stable in life but my sister's situations makes me think twice.

Although alam ko naman sa sarili ko na I'm much better than them kasi medyo natuto naman na ako sa kanila. Also, I think this is God's way of giving us KARMA kasi yung nanay ko eh may history ng panlalalaki dati and it's not discussed sa family. Nabaon nalang sa lupa na di alam ng parents na aware kaming mga anak niya sa ganon.

So, ayun. Mag-asawa pa ba ako or maging rich-asian-tita na lang na maraming pera? ü•≤",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/168k3ej/all_of_my_siblings_have_failed_their_marriage/,t2_7eqc04rt,1693705069.0
ang saya makahinga ng maluwag,"possible TW

lumipat kami rito sa bahay ng tita ko kasi sobrang abusive ng tatay ko. nananakit siya physically and emotionally, sobrang libog din niya. naninilip siya kapag maliligo ako o kapag iihi ako tapos he would act like it was ""accudental"", napansin din pala ng kapatid ko 'yun kaya he helped me change curtains doon sa CR ng bahay ng tatay ko. nung una akala ko nasa isip ko lang 'yun and accidentally lang talaga. pero nagpipigil na ako ng ihi ko madalas nung nandun pa kami and I don't take showers regularly na rin dahil natatakot na ako na masilipan uli. kahit 'yung skin care ko hindi ko na rin magawa kasi natatakot ako na baka mag-attempt na naman siyang hipuan ako. 

ngayong nandito na ako sa bahay ng tita ko, I take showers regularly na and I started to do my skin care na uli. bumalik na rin appetite ko. hindi ko na kailangan mag-earphones uli para magpatugtog ng malakas kapag nag-aaway sila mama. hindi ko na kailangan pilitin sarili ko na matulog kapag lasing na naman tatay ko para lang hindi ako ma-trigger. wala na rin akong suicidal ideation since we moved out saka nakaka-feel na ako ng emotions ngayon kahit konti, hindi na rin ako numb physically.

When he ran away from home, it's noticeable that I was very happy about that. My mom even cried because she said I'm too insensitive. 

I already have PTSD from sexual assaults and whenever he's near me, I can feel myself become rigid and in fight and flight mode. I just feel this anger and resentment. 

For example, my work station is in our living room because I need a larger space. However, whenver he goes out at night in the living room, I would go inside my room and locked myself, rendering my working hours unproductive.

Whatever he owns and touches, I feel disgusted. Like he has germs and an  incurable disease. At the back of my mind, I'm gagging.

"It is my late Pa's birthday, and I'm still resentful","My father died in 2014 due to diabetes complications (which is his own doing since he refused to take insulin even though the docs already advised him years before to consider). He was a chronic cheater - he got my mom pregnant and they're not married then. He cheated on her, and got the other woman pregnant too. The gap between me and my half-sibling were mere months. He had another child with the said woman and then he got my mom pregnant again (mom really has issues to deal with her own too, apparently). He had two more children after my sister with the other woman, AND CHEATED ON HER AGAIN, WITH ANOTHER WOMAN. That another woman also got pregnant, and he got twins - who were just turning two or three when Pa died.

Pa is an asshole, and he never been a good father to us. On my 7th birthday, my mom invited him to eat with us in a local Jollibee store. He showed up, but said he was in a hurry and merely THREW a fucking 500 peso bill on our table where we waited for him. He left without greeting me a happy birthday, my mom cried as we ate.

I cannot wish you a happy birthday Pa, sincerely - fuck you. Fuck you for all the trauma you gave me and my sister. Fuck you kasi kahit sa mga half-siblings ko tinraumatize mo sa iyong constant cheating, emotional and physical abuse. Fuck you at lahat ng mga kamag-anak mo na in-others kami.

Bakit may mga ex na gustong bumalik kahit alam na nilang imposible?,"My ex ako 4 years ago, almost 6 years din kami nung nagkahiwalay kami. Reason why ako nakipag hiwalay kase nasaktan niya na ko physically. Umayaw na talaga ako nung una pinapalampas ko yong mga verbally abused niya. Sobrang seloso kase niya like pag may nagchat sakin na kaworkmate ko kahit tl ko na lalaki noong nag working student ako siya nag rereply. He even ask me always saan ako, saan ako kumain, kung sino bang katabi ko, send ako ng pic and lahat ng soc med ko hawak niya na. Take note may anak na kami niyan mag 1 year old nun yong baby ko. Pag nagseselos siya mumurahin niya ko and he even say mamatay ka na. Pag ganun dati hinahayaan ko na lng siya like d ko pinapatulan sasabihin ko lang ""tapos ka na ? ako naman pwede ?"" mga ganun kase ineexplain ko rin side ko. Hanggang sa naubos patience ko nsagot sagot ko siya namura mura ko rin siya hanggang nasaktan niya ko. Sa kanya lang ako natutong lumaban ng ganun. So nakipaghiwalay na ko nawalan na rin ako ng love for him and also for the sake of my child din ayoko lumaki siya ng ganun. 


Then now nakakausap ko pa ate niya kase yun may concern sa baby ko like siya madalas nangangamusta kase d nag susupport ex ko. Nag ask siya nung isang araw kung sakali raw ba bumalik kapatid niya sakin tatanggapin ko raw ba or bibigyan ko ng chance. Ang sabi ko friends lng siguro or civil lng para sa anak ko. Nagtaka ako kase my gf na kapatid niya at almost 2 years na rin sila so nagtanung ako bakit. Sabi ng ate niya ang sabi raw ng kapatid niya sakanya handa niya raw iwan gf niya pag bumalik ako kase sobrang iba raw ako hindi niya raw ako makalimutan at mahal parin daw ako. Napamura ako sa utak ko kase saan siya humuhugot ng ganun eh alam niya ng impossible na kami at kawawa gf niya kase ganun thinking niya. Ayoko na rin talaga kase una hindi ko na siya mahal, nasaktan niya na ko physically, nawalan na siya ng respeto at alam ko uulitin niya lang yun. 

Bakit ba may mga ganung tao, nung may chance sila na pahalagahan ka ipakita yong deserve mo d nila pinapakita tapos kung kelan lahat na ng chances binigay mo at sumuko ka na dun pa babalik.

I lost my Greatest love to my mental illness,"Me and my first bf of 5yrs broke up 2017. We already saved for our future, we already have plans for our marriage . We already have names for our future kids. Up until now, i cant help but remember how great it is to be loved by someone like him. It's been almost five years. He's already with someone else. All this time i blamed him for falling out of love, but i now know, kasalanan ko. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder year 2016. Kasama ko sya sa lahat ng checkups ko minsan sya pa bumibili ng meds ko. Nun nasa rock bottom ako di nya ako iniwan, kahit na sya ang sumasalo ng sumpong ko. I verbally and physically abused him. Having bipolar cannot justify my abuse. It is my responsibility to fix myself. When he told me he cannot take it anymore, i was angry. Akala ko ba mahal nya ako. Pero sabi nya naubos na daw sya. I can't understand it nuon. Kinakain ako ng sakit at galit ko. Pero kahit sabi nya di na nya ko mahal pag kailangan ko sya he's always there for me. But im in too much pain whenever I see him. Thinking that this guy whom i share my future dreams and goals with, no longer loves me, ang sakit. Kaya ako na ang pumutol ng lahat. I let him go. One year later, nabalitaan ko, may gf na sya. Me, im trying to focus on being better. Nasaktan ako, pero hinga ng malalim, he deserves to be happy. After all the pain that i put him thru, dapat lang na maging masaya sya. Now im really in a better place. Bihira na ako sumpungin, now i can think clearly. I can handle my sumpong way better than before. And pag naalala ko yun mga oras at pagkakataon na nasasaktan ko sya, ambigat sa pakiramdam. Wala sya ibang ginawa kundi mahalin at alagaan ako. But i hurt him, so much. Minsan gusto ko sya kausapin, para mag sorry, pero naiisip ko, di ko na sya dapat guluhin para lang mabawasan yun guilt na nararamdaman ko. I still love him. I will always pray for his happiness, even if that happiness no longer includes me, I'll be forever grateful. Andami ko natutunan sa first heartache ko. It made me wise. Girls can also be abusive talaga. Hindi cute ang toyo culture. Let's always be understanding and compassionate with one another.

My mom went home as a surprise from abroad and I feel weird,"For short, Im 20F and my mom used to abuse me emotionally and she hit me physically (last year) and di kami close. Malayo na loob ko sa kanya kasi growing up, di kami masyado nagsasama.

So eto, may sumabing ‚ÄúTao po‚Äù sa labas ng bahay namin eh 11pm na. Kami ng ate ko kumain at nag chismis , pero nung may narinig kaming tao bigla kaming tumahimik. Kala kasi namin, baka taong namamasko lang eh wag na lang pansinin.

Putcha 30 sec after eh di siya huminto ng ‚Äútao po‚Äù . Sabi ko sa ate ko ‚ÄúParang kaboses ni mama noh?‚Äù 

Chineck ni ate at yun, nabigla siya at siya nga talaga. Si mama. Nag surprise welcome home.


Idk what to feel, masaya ako pero at the same time nainis at nabigla. Bago pa naman kami nag usap ni mama few days ago na hindi pa ako handa na uuwi siya this April. Sabi niya naiintindihan niya at aware siya. 

Di ko gets talaga.. siguro magpaplastikan nlng ako. She is cordial and happy and i smile at her and everything, but deep down I am still uncomfy. Hays.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/18ukcbw/my_mom_went_home_as_a_surprise_from_abroad_and_i/,t2_jz4072wjl,1703956263.0
mommy where,"mommy issues

ever since i was young, i didnt have a good rs with my mom unlike other girls out there who have this bff rs with theirs and can actually open up. siguro, i kinda gaslighted myself into thinking na what we have is normal kasi unlike others who were abandoned, pinagpalit, or were physically abused, i was just ""cared for"" in a tough way lol

when i was 9 or 10 ata, my dad bought me the galaxy champ bc weeks before that, they bought one for my sibling. i was aware that time na we were gipit and couldve bought something more valuable with the money so i told him na wag na, next time nalng, but he insisted bc its for me daw. sadly, after my mom found out, she got super mad at me and called me so many names, names that up until now i will never forget.

one time, i also had a classmate that had her wallet stolen inside our classroom. instead of protecting her child, my mom told me na if ako daw nagnakaw, i should just confess. she told me multiple times. 

now i am studying in a state univ. and would emphasize to her friends na public school LANG ako nakapag enroll. disregarding the fact na it's not that easy to be admitted since hs and shs grades were the basis sa admission and that i couldve actually entered a private univ if only hindi ako nakokonsensya sa tuition. 

ik what ive been through is not as rough as others but siguro if only i had a good rs with her, i would actually enjoy her company at least. welp siguro as time passes, things may flip around. 

to all moms out there, pls be kind to ur daughter.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/ygmfux/mommy_where/,t2_kjguhrn4,1667057055.0
Walking on eggshells for Christmas Eve,"Disclaimer: Fully venting here. I don‚Äôt need anyone giving me advices. 

Weird christmas eve. From the very start, maikli talaga pasensya ng Dad ko. Kaya it‚Äôs so hard to do anything sa bahay when he‚Äôs around. He‚Äôs a cook by profession, and tuwing family events gusto nya nagluluto. 

Tonight, he wants to make some dishes for Christmas Eve. Isa doon ang sandwiches. Si Mommy, ayaw na ng luto-luto. Pagod kasi sya from work pero nagt-try na lang din sya tumulong para di mabungangaan ng Dad ko. Naiinis si Mommy ng pabiro, sabi maggawa na lang daw ng madaling mga food. (Last year kasi we ordered na lang‚Äî di namin kasama Dad namin non). Tapos natawa lang si Dad at first kasi nga raw gutam na si Mommy. A bit later, hinanap ni Mommy aling mayonnaise gagamitin. Tinanong nya Dad ko, kung yung kewpie raw ba or yung magnolia. My Dad replied sternly ‚ÄúKayo bahala. Parang ayaw mo naman gumawa e, kanina ka pa.‚Äù To which my Mom responded meekly ‚ÄúNagtanong lang ako aling mayo gagamitin e‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúGanon talaga, pag may handa tayo kailangan magprep ng pagkain.‚Äù 

Sinalo ko na lang si Mommy at ako na lang gumawa sandwiches. Jusko. Hirap gumalaw. Recently, di ko alam pakiramdam noong nalaman sa MRI nya na may possibility na may cancer cells sa prostate nya. I‚Äôm not close with my Dad kahit sya provider namin. Never kami nagkaroon ng solid na father-daughter relationship. He gets physically abusive kasi when provoked. I will not go into details anymore, basta litong lito ako sa nararamdaman ko towards sa kanya recently. Sometimes, I think, okay lang kaya ako pagmawala sya? Okay naman na siguro, napagtapos na nya ako e. Wala na syang aalalahanin sakin. I just feel extremely lost and indifferent. 

Dad, ik bumabawi ka. Ayoko lang makuha/magaya unconsciously mga ginagawa mong ayaw ko. Sorry, alam ko ring na-miss out mo kaming lumaki nina Kuya. Ang hirap mo lang mahalin.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/18ptqbx/walking_on_eggshells_for_christmas_eve/,t2_uus7wfyf,1703418385.0
