Domestic Violence - I grew up thinking it was normal Filipino culture. Stop the cycle.,"Domestic violence is a crime but more so a **mental health** problem. People who engage in domestic violence have most likely learned it so from a previous experience. 

 [https://psychcentral.com/lib/what-causes-domestic-violence/](https://psychcentral.com/lib/what-causes-domestic-violence/) 

I saw a video of domestic violence shared by James Deakin, journalist, and it triggered some PTSD. I legit started cried in front of my GF. When my GF (raised in Pinas), saw the video, she couldn't believe that I grew up in that situation and turned out pretty well.  I saw myself in that kid screaming at his dad to stop. At 30, I'm still affected by things that happened during my childhood. 

For any parents out there, stop the cycle!!!

Backstory: 

For as long as I can remember, my dad would go crazy (matotopak talaga) and things would escalate, ending up with me beat up. This isn't just a problem in low income/low education families, it can happen to anyone. 

I grew up in the US, my parents both professionals (nurse/engineer), well-behaved kids, etc. My dad would go crazy, not even an alcoholic... If there was a fight between my parents, my dad would pull me into it, using me as a punching bag since he could't hit my mom or brother, (sucks to be the panganay). I would even hate exam weeks in elementary because that would mean studying with my dad, ending up getting beat too. I would always end up in a panic mode state and it would just anger my dad even more. 

Even so, I love both my parents, yes even my dad. Other than his outbursts, my dad was great. He taught me so much and made sure we got almost anything we wanted/needed, always worries about us. Even now he's worried that something might happen to me because of the whole pandemic. For my dad it was an anxiety trigger, that now as an adult I seem to have to a lesser degree. 

I was lucky that my mom was so strong and level-headed, she kept telling me that it was a psych/mental issue.  ""Ganun ugali ng lola at ibang kapatid nya"", ""wag mo idala sa future anak mo"" etc.

Anyway, for those of you affected and you feel there is nothing you can do. Report it to proper authorities, and if possible have them seek mental health assistance as well.

Enablers,"I’m a domestic violence survivor and now they still hunt me

Bakit may mga taong sila na nga yung may kasalanan or may nagawang mali tapos sila pa yung may lakas ng loob magparinig at manlait? Hi, call me A and I’m a victim of domestic violence. I’ll make this story short na lang. 

7 years kami ng ex ko. I was physically and mentally abused. May anak kami. Di nya sinustentuhan at hindi niya sinusustentuhan. I tried asking for help sa barangay, nagharap kami don and he agreed na magbigay ng 1k per month para sa anak naming may special needs (Yes my son is PWD. And so am I. Pero later ko na explain). Nagstart naman siya magbigay ng “ 500” a month lol but after ilang buwan nagstop na. So sabi ko ok mukhang ayaw talaga. Wag na pilitin.

What I bother the most is yung family niya, his current live-in-partner and yung friends ni ate girl. Kasi grabe po sila mang bully sa akin. Panay parinig, and kung makalait sila sa appearance and weight ko. Ang lala. Pinagtutulungan nila ako even the friends ng gf ng ex ko na hindi naman ako kilala. 

I have depression and anxiety disorder and 3 years nako nagtetake ng meds for it. dahil nga don sa nangyari sa akin na ginawa ng ex ko.

Until now ayaw nila ako patahimikin. Sometimes, naiisip ko nang gümawa ng masama sakanila dahil sukdulan na galit at sama ng oob ko sakanila. How come they have the audacity to do that to me kahit na wala naman akong ginawa sa kanila in the first place?",https://i.redd.it/o378zhlr8xvb1.jpg,t2_kl7pi79yj,1698053469.0
Emotionless,"My problem is that after seeing brutal domestic violence towards my mom, towards me, having alcoholic father since I was born, don’t having friends until high school, being bullied, having sad one sided love, being betrayed by all my friends.. I think I just saw too much shit during my 20 years of life. I am so emotionally exhausted after 3 years of clinical depression and taking meds+ gaining 20kg of weight bc of meds. I have no tears left, I can’t see the world as other people do. I am planning my every step, controlling all my facial expressions and words. I want to feel that my life is finally under my control. 

But it’s not how people make friends and fall in love. People love extrovert/careless people more than me. And I 100% understand that, it is always better to have someone funny rather than having someone that constantly has suicide thoughts. 

 After all of that shit I went through , I just now feel peace in daily life. But I got no one by my side. I don’t have friends, I have never had a boyfriend in my 20 years, I even didn’t had a male friend because I’m terrified of them. 

I’ve been doing therapy for so long and I made a good relationship with my parents and forgave them. Now I can start a new life.

I want to be happy finally. I deserved that. But I just don’t know how. I feel like mentally I’m 3 year old that went to kindergarten and starts to learn how to socialise. But I’m 20. This is the best time of my life. And I can’t even laugh at anything. Everything that people laugh about seems so stupid to me. I get annoyed by emotional people just because I’m jealous of what they have. The ability of being easy going.

I feel like a abounded puppy on the road, that was thrown to live a normal life without even knowing what to do. All I know is pain. I consist of 100% pain and nothing else.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/11gyyt5/emotionless/,t2_uw3e52wm,1677844878.0
Need urgent help,"TW: DV attempt?? Not sure

I confronted my parents and called them out about how it’s always about them, about how I was disrespected and ignored and not listened to but was as usual I was faced with gaslighting, infantilism, and invalidation. Normal, like with any other family who have mentally ill children.

In any case, I was audio recording it for my safety but without their knowledge at first. We had a heated conversation and some screaming cos I’m really angered by how they continue to treat me despite already knowing my diagnosis, and how their ignorance/idiocy is really infuriating. When they learned they were being recorded, they went silent and packed up and left the room, and suddenly dad called me possessed and that I was a demon, called me out on how blood is thicker than water, I simply rebutted and said I don’t respect people who don’t respect me. The whole time I was (still am) shaking but I just stood ground, I didn’t let anyone touch me, I didn’t let anyone near me. Whenever they’d reach out, I’d simply say “please don’t touch me, I’m very scared and uncomfortable at the moment, I’m shaking”. 

Then afterwards, my dad, who obviously has anger issues, went rampant and started throwing things around. He also called me possessed, crazy, insane (with matching hand gesture by the temple), demonic, possessed by a demon, etc. My mom is a conflict avoider so she’s literally avoided all these years of marriage to ever anger him to this extent. I’m not fazed by it but I just don’t know what to do now. They threaten to call the cops on me, to file charges against me for harassment, I encouraged them to do so, cos I sincerely want to talk to the cops about this. They say I’m crazy, so I encouraged them to call the mental health center and arrange me living in there because I’d love to stop living with them. I have an e certificate of my therapist’s diagnosis on me, I have my fiancé who knows me more than they do and also have been wanting to file charges against them for the abuse they’re actively doing to me- even after a session with my psychologist where he explained my diagnosis to them.

I have a self defense stick with me. I’m just in my room. In case he attempts to assault me, I’ve been told to just let him bruise me, that way we have solid evidence of domestic violence. But yes, please help, I’m (as usual) in threat state, anxious for whatever they might pull against me. What am I supposed to do here? What if they strip me of basic needs like internet access, food, water, etc., are these grounds for anything? I’ve never been in this situation before, and I’ve never thought of ever being in one. It just happened. The audio recording I immediately sent to my fiancé and therapist in case I don’t make it to my scheduled therapy session later afternoon.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/shehx2/need_urgent_help/,t2_29rb2cs6,1643668707.0
"Need help for trauma related therapy, tips, advice, contact person, or anything would help!!!","This isnt actually for me. This is for my friend and im helping her look for a good therapy. She's dealing with a lot of trauma due to incest rape (childhood), separation issues, domestic violence in her childhood.

She also has scoliosis (this might have some effect on her mental health). The mental health issues that she's currently dealing with are 

>dissociation (at some point she had to cut me off because it was getting so bad that shes somewhere near developing another personality, she dissociates a lot when im with her i think she doesn't trust the fact that im real and it gets overwhelming for her)  

>Periodically, she has troubles with breathing. 

>I think around last month she almost committed suicide, also she self harms. 

>Detachment, she says. I don't quite understand this part either, i thought this was dissociation too but im just not sure. 

>Constantly tired, sleeping too much, eating too little

>Physical contact with men scares her (she screams) 

She describes these as rotational (not sure if i used the proper word lol) so there are parts of the month that these symptoms peak, and there are parts of the month where she's actually hopeful for something. I think that tells me that some of it are hormonal. They dont go away though, frequency just lessens at some days. 


Im not actually sure if i worded these things properly and they may come off as insensitive to some people here in this subreddit, im really trying my best to walk her through this. What I'm actually looking for are advice for getting a good therapist that has the credibility to tend to these symptoms (i read in a foreign article that i should be looking for a trauma therapist for the dissociation). Also im scared with having her thrown to a therapy that will give her tons of medication and less of the actual therapy, actually i think she prefers to leave out the medication. Or you can just simply leave links to sites that will give us knowledge on what and who to look for. Also advice on what not to look for and who i should avoid. Also, some insight on good medications if its unavoidable. I may also add that her budget is not that bad i think, maybe something close to 5k per session will be great, but im just worried about the quality of the services she'll be accepting. She went through therapy sometime in the past too but i think it didn't go well and all i know is she had medication that just numbs her. Any help will be appreciated, thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/hbeh6q/need_help_for_trauma_related_therapy_tips_advice/,t2_54k43w1x,1592486494.0
I feel like my anxiety / depression is getting worse. I want to get checked but I feel like I can't afford it.,"I've been having suicidal thoughts almost all my life. As a child, I grew up in a family of domestic violence. I would wake up to my dad hurting mom, older siblings fighting dad to protect mom and me, siblings fighting each other. Fights were bad fights, really bad ones at that. I remember dad once bit my brother's arm during a fight. I remember waking up to him, banging my mom's head on the bed while Mom does nothing but pray so loud. I remember him chasing my brother with a knife. I remember ny brother locking him outside our house so he couldn't hurt us as he hurls things in any direction. I remember waking up that morning with almost all of our things broken and shattered into bits.

Since then, I developed thoughts on hurting and killing myself. I feel like depression started then. We left him when I was in 2nd yr hs. I got so high functioning in highschool and college that I almost forgot about it. Almost but not quite. There were still episodes of me crying all day nonstop when I was told to transfer schools in hs. There were some episodes during college when I would fail somebody's expectations, etc.

I feel like depression got worse when I started working. I am in a 4yr relationship now, which I don't want to write in detail about. I know it's not the best relationship one could ask for. It helped me get through a lot, really. But I feel like the relationship is also taking its toll on my mental health. Along with all the other factors.

I've been wanting to get some professional help for more than a year now. I just can't find the courage to, and the budget to. I am frightened to go to a hospital to have myself checked. I am also worried about the fees I need to pay. I feel like I am being selfish if I use my money to spend for consultation, which I am not sure I need and deserve. Btw, I am the only one working in a 5 person family. I am trying so hard to make ends meet, so a consultation is a luxury I feel like I cannot afford.

I don't know what to do now. I really really need to get this sorted out before it takes its toll on me. I don't know what to do. Where do I go from here? Where do I start even? When is the best time to go? I have a lot of question in mind. Please help me.

Thank you. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/auyatt/i_feel_like_my_anxiety_depression_is_getting/,t2_2vagprp0,1551179666.0
Just a bottled up vent with frustrations and such...,"I (21yr M) has a lot of trauma that i think can be classified as PTSD that begun during childhood and frequen abuse from family persisted till today...  


As a kid or before I was even born, my dad used to be a drug addict who slept all day, drank with friends, and basically neglected me a lot, my mom on the other hand who at the time is a dental student trying her best to graduate.

During my younger years, we were more or less broke and barely coming by, me and my mom was underweight as a student and my dad had been using his work money he earned from the butchers for mostly his vices, and would fight consistently with my mom and sometimes beating me up randomly back then.

During this time, my aunt from my mom's side who saw what was happening tempted my mom to flirt via e-mail to an OFW, basically she did that reluctantly out of frustration due to the constant stuff my dad had been doing back then and to also make my Karen of an aunt shut up. She exchanged a few simple e-mails with this one OFW and received a few gifts from this person. My dad at that time caught wind of the conversations and e-mails, and began to develop paranoia, hallucinations and etc which became worse due to his vices.

The years that followed after my mom had gotten her own clinic, both my parents have been fighting nonstop usually involving frequent visits to the local medical center, police station, my mom's side family home in the provinces. In these fights we end up severly wounded, with a lot of our personal belongings getting destroyed by him. I usually end up as a bargaining chip to either one of my parents while being neglected by both. The younger me was so naive and was too forgiving to the atrocities around me... I'd ask for help from my dad's side relatives to stop him sometimes, bring him to rehab or put him in jail but they were extremely forgiving and pitied my dad despite me and my mom having so much wounds and bruises... My dad's family even victim blamed both of us on why my dad is like this due to the fact my mom technically cheated on him for a while. Every day back then as a child, I'd stay up, worried that my dad may kill me or my mom or that we wont live to see another day...

Both my parents and entire family paid no mind to me at all (I was molested by a crazy drug addicted neighbor at a young age, luckily i wasnt raped since i ran away after he loosened his grip on me)... While my dad, he acted like every word he said was absolute, and if i failed to obey perfectly, i'd get shoved in sack, beaten up or i'd get tortured by having him use my teeth or nails to open his bottles of beer. No one stopped him or stood up for me... I once had gotten a struck by dengue as a kid, forced to go to school because if i didnt ""he'd look bad"" wherein i got hit because i ended up convulsing at class due to extreme high fever while vomiting (one of my aunt's who saw me suffered got me treated for this while i was confined for nearly a month). I also got multiple bite wounds from stray dogs from getting yelled at to go buy him beer from a far away street wherein I was hit and victim blamed by my dad for not knowing what to do during my third grade of elementary (The concerned neighbors who witnessed the events were the ones who rushed me to the medical center to get injected with a vaccine for anti-rabies just in case). I also had gotten a severe infection on my hand from opening up a liquor bottle for him wherein i wasn't able to write properly at school for a while since it took an entire sem without it getting treated because of him taking the earnings of my mom and using most of the budget on his vices.

The punishments i most fondly remember as a kid was that I would be beaten up, put in a sack, have my personal belongings be it school works or toys destroyed in front of me, not being allowed to eat meals for a few days, getting electrocuted by a tazer from time to time (I couldn't properly write anymore nor hold a pencil because of this), and slashing a bit of my torso and legs since my bruises and wounds would be hidden behind my uniform.

Anyways, back to topic, my situation got worse when my dad was caught at a checkpoint with his friends carrying illegal drugs which got shown on the news via unang hirit. the parents of my classmates, the neighbors and my classmate would avoid me like the plague or treat me like a pariah during the duration of my entire elementary class because of this, I would get bullied as well or beaten up too by some of my classmates at the time because of how I could be possibly doing something illegal since my dad was caught doing crime, and I was always treated like some sort of villain everytime. even my teachers back then were avoiding me due to the speculations and such. My grandma had bailed out my dad almost immediately due to her pity for him. During this time as well, I was belittled by my family and consistently compared to another person's kid and used as a bad example for academics because i couldnt properly write normally, i had barely passing grades or extremely low ones due to multiple absences due to my family situation and so on...

My naivety in false belief in happy families ended however when one day, he came back home, extremely drunk or under the effect of drugs, and without reason at 2 or 3 am midnight, he broke the bedroom doors, dragged me and my mom by the legs as we got scratches from the rough floor.  
He was as usual accusing my mom of cheating as he was holding up a knife, and he began to attack me for no reason till he yelled at me ""HINDI KITA ANAK!"" he tied my hands up, pulled me up, poured some fuel on a box with my toys and various belongings on it and began to burn it...  
as he took the knife and slowly stabbed it on my arm, i was screaming, my mom and relatives around the area did nothing to help while my mouth was covered with cloth. he then to proceed to slowly stab my chest with it... till a few of the stray cats i was feeding began to pounce on my dad which gave me some time to escape...

I ran all the way out towards the barangay hall where they would apply medicine on me but I saw my dad giving chase to me with reddish eyes while holding a knife. when he saw that i was in the hall he ran back home and hid. I was brought to my aunt later on that night and stayed there for four months, skipping classes somewhat. I was too afraid of people at this point in time. I then learnt how to use my aunt's laptop at that time and became addicted to online games to cope I suppose or to do something else than idling away the hours hiding from my parents. It was there that my fingers which were stiff from tazer punishment was slowly but surely able to move properly enough for me to hold a pen and write but with bad handwriting. Basically I ended up coping by becoming a shut-in at a young age with video games and some shows to slowly take my mind off the trauma for a while.

By the fourth month of my time there, I had to be returned back to my parents to go to school, Even if i didnt want to return, I ended up getting forced by both my parents... I developed a regular habit to avoid staying near the house wherein i get an empty box and sleep in it for the night be it rain or shine since i feel intense fear and my chest ends up too heavy. No one in my family would look for me, so i kept this up for a few months till a family friend reported what i was doing to my parents and they would yell at me for embarassing them.  
I at least changed schools when going into highschool to at least start a new life to avoid getting bullied, but at this point i was still extremely cautious and I didnt know who to properly tell all this to out of fear in getting belittled, victim blamed, and so on which drove me to failed suicide attempts and my parents yelled at me for being papansin... (They even told me that ill go to hell or that im a demon since i dont have enough faith kay God raw even though i pray desperately every day for things to get better like my life depends on it.)

By this time I was about to be grade 7 or first year in highschool at this time however, during the first week of my highschool, my parents had quarrelled so hard that they temporarily separated with my mom taking me to the provinces to her family for a while with me missing out the first two semesters of my first year of highschool.

Her entire family was blaming me for all my mother's suffering and pains, and when i thought my mom would comfort me, she too ended up blaming me as the reason on why she keeps on getting hurt and her clinic frequently gets property damage (wherein most of her staff quits because of absurd verbal abuse and accusations my dad says due to his belief that my mom is still cheating)  
Everytime he would get arrested, he would easily get bailed out by his mom or grandma...

And meanwhile my mom, under the influence of her sister, went gung-ho on all the cards which made her gained terrible records on majority of the bank accounts she owns so she then took mine and what little i managed to save up there... So basically I still live with a terrible record on my bank account too and future bank accounts because of what she did... (with g-cash being the most viable option i have in the present)

One of the things i managed to however get from that irresponsible habit of hers is my own desktop with an internet connection.

From there I continued being a shut-in for a while at my mom's relative's house. I dont usually leave the room i sleep at since i would get terrible glares from her family and her and i would eat their leftovers once everyone has gone to sleep.

During my time as a shut-in i got addicted to a certain online multiplayer game and from there, I slowly developed my social and communication skills from the players ive talked to or conversed with. from this time, I realized they also had similar yet different cases from mine, so I just began desiring to befriend em because it felt like I made proper friends and acquaintances to be ""myself"" with and talk about my wounds with. These friends of mine despite their problems, slowly but surely inspired me to try to get my life back in order and gave me a goal to want to reach despite my sorry state. It was the conceptual goal of proper revenge, not in the revenge of harming others to comfort myself, but the revenge wherein I got to ensure that my future would be a happier one, a future wherein i could have and experience a warm and happy family that trusts each other far away from this mess of a situation, with my second goal being to help others in similar yet different situations due to my gratitude for the friends I met online that helped me get through that rough time somewhat...

From that point on, I formed a goal and a dream of avenging my younger self by getting a happy future while helping out many others... I kept quiet about this goal for a long time.

Anyways, eventually my mom and dad came to terms for a bit, but as drug addicts go, the cycle of domestic violence and abuse continue.

At this point in time during my grade 8, my parents and I began living in this tight spaced apartment building on the second floor of my mom's clinic space which she rented. Both my parents are irresponsible with my mom and dad making a mess and them screaming at me to clean it up while blaming me for the mess they make. (they sometimes break and dispose the things i own up so that they can have more space for their things).

Their fighting about the same repeated topic occurs over and over again, and this time my dad became extremely invasive to the point he put restriction codes on both me and my mom's device while consistently checking both our e-mails just to find no more evidence since my mom didnt continued what her sister tempted her to do years ago. He has went absolute bonkers to buying a sim card to forge fake evidences of fake conversations just to force my mom to admit to something, and accuse her of being a foreign porn actress that my dad's friends said she looked similar to. He then consistently accused me of being her accomplice and called both of us devils.

Me and my mom frequently gets beaten up, wounded and traumatized on a daily basis where even my mom would blame me for minor faults she's done like accidentally cause a crack on the cabinet which would cause my dad to break my things and beat me with it.

His drug tendencies however ended when my pent up frustrations towards him just bursted.  
It was the start of the Du30 regime at this point in time of my recollections, my dad was under the influence of drugs and consistently abused me and my mom. So I hatched a plan to get him into trouble which would force his permissive family to send him to a proper rehabilitation facility. When they fought, I'd call the police, and go down to protect my mom. Holding a stick as a weapon i tried to fight back at him to let my mom escape, and let myself get beaten up horribly by my dad while causing the most damage to the clinic. I fainted and passed out on the floor with a bunch of broken glass, cuts and bruises at that time but the sacrifice was worth it, since from that point in time, my life was slowly changing. (im not a du30 supporter btw since i condemn the killings but the entire EJK situation worked in my favor somewhat and gave me some slight change)

When the police arrived, some military personnel on leave went around the clinic too since they were nearby the place as well, there they saw wounded me to take to the medical center for medication. and around the same time, they were on a hunt for my dad whom they found and took to custody in their station. My grandma who worried that if she bails out my dad would get shot, decided to opt and request the court for him to get sent to rehab for the next few years.

During that time of peace without my dad, my mom this time became the abuser in a sense. She would degrade me, speak negatively about me on a daily basis, she only makes or prepares food for herself at lunch whereas i wasnt able to eat breakfast or dinner since i go to school. I used to be incredibly underweight and as usual i rely on leftovers back then till i learnt how to cook due to one of my classes at school.

For the longest of time, I guess I felt lonely. I had no one in my immediate family to run to. I have no confidence in myself either to make new friends since i had this fear that they could potentially hurt or bully me too...

&#x200B;

Before I reached 10th grade my dad was released from rehab, he became a different type of person yet retaining some abusive habits. He however this time became more of a religious fanatic.

&#x200B;

He rarely fought with my mom from then on but all their pent up stress and problems. im still their scapegoat. getting gaslit and verbally abused by that, and whenever my dad would get drunk he would hurt me physically by beating me up or doing some absurd ways of punishment to me for minor things that i didnt know i had to do (e.g. clean up my mom's clinic, clean up everything that everyone including the dental staff used, prepare food for the entire dental staff before classes early morning, cleaning the dental clinic bathroom, cleaning their trash around the room, and many more absurd commands)  


I ran away from home multiple times, out of instinct and slept outside at the park or plaza from time to time... I rarely ate during my highschool years too...

During my grade 10-grade 12 years, i joined competitions to avoid staying with my parents or to get distance from them... it felt like bliss... i was never after the medals, i was after the small window of freedom. I did stuff for survival, I handled some part-time jobs to at least earn me a meal, when there's an event, i'd hoard a lot of food to ensure i'd eat the next few days...  


but anyways during my grade 11-12 years it was time to decide on a college, I applied for two universities of which were my dream unis, I passed the exams on both and got scholarship grants on both. however, my dad was very manipulative, he said he needed my help to improve his image again after I ruined it raw, and when i would try to go, I would be prevented and degraded and he would say stuff like: ""hindi ka makakabuhay o makakasurvive diyan!"" ""scholarship?! wag ka na magsingungaling! ang tanga tanga mo nga dito eh hindi mo kaya kaming matulungan ng mama mo!"", he made papers and enrollment forms without my knowledge to be enrolled at his old college as if he's projecting himself to me, but luckily by this time, the pandemic hit, so i ended up choosing a homeschool Oed uni for my course of AB Psychology...  


During my year 1 of OeD college, I met my SO(25f) from a dating site while multitasking with modules.  
My SO is the sole reason i haven't decided to end myself so far, while being able to help me improve my own quality of life. She literally endured a 3-5 hour travel to meet me just to see how im doing while she worries about my health and such and because of her, we more or less forced my parents out of peer pressure that im to live separately from them within the city at least...  
This in turn gave improvement to my mental health but it made me realize that i've developed a response to loud shouting, and so on, and afterwards id receive triggers that would cause me to have traumatic memories play uncontrollably which would make me go into a spiral of mental and emotional breakdowns...  


As of recent despite me living in a separate location from my parents, my dad still tries to control my actions by spreading false rumours to his friends at church about me and he sometimes gaslights and guilt trips my SO that I've strayed away from the path of God or something. The overcontrolling abusive behavior is so bad that when i try to adopt a kitten, he threatens to kill it even though we dont live in the same place just because of his beliefs that cats are evil and will cause me to die.  


At this point i dont even know what to do for the moment... aside to wait and hope for a better future  
Because I need to find a local behavioral therapist for my PTSD and I need to graduate so i can finally be free and live with my SO  


Sorry for long post and if it cannot be understood well enough, as of the moment im typing this, im in a mental breakdown because my dad involved multiple people to downplay my mental disorder... and told me to ""move on"" ""thats the past na!"" without taking accountability or noticing that his current actions are causing this breakdown....",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/yxqe8q/just_a_bottled_up_vent_with_frustrations_and_such/,t2_ygujg5h,1668692008.0
