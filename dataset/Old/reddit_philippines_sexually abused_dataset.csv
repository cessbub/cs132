TW( Sexual Abuse) need legal advise on filling a law suit,"Im 19m

In 4th grade I was raped by my babysitter who is a gay male, this continued for almost the entirety of my 4th grade as he stayed with us. He would make me suck him, rape me, and even do it in my sleep. I didnt object at the time because i though this was normal and didnt make a big deal out of it. I want to file a case but i dont know how as this happened a long time ago and there would be a lack of evidence. The closest piece of evidence i could think of is the OCD that started when he did those to me, which developed into depression and schizoprenia when i was a teenager( seeing sexual hallucinations, gore, etc. testified by my psychiatrist) which took a toll on my life as it affected my studies and mental state.This is really bad cause hes an elementary teacher which could mean he had more possible victims.

[NSFW/Triggering(?)] How high are cases of children being sexually abused?,"First off if this is too offending or too much to be discussed openly in this subreddit, I'd like to ask for the admins to delete my post. 

A little bit of backstory, when I was a kid hindi ako yung tipo na namulat agad sa athletics or even technology. For the longest time, ang impression palagi sakin ng mga matatanda at nung iba kong kalaro malambot ako or bakla. This led to a lot of girls gravitating towards me to be their friend because they automatically felt safer around me dahil wala sa itsura ko yung mambabastos nung bata. Nowadays, mas mukha akong snatcher kaysa mabait but I've still kept a close circle of female friends who feel safe around me.

One of the things that they all have in common is that they've experienced sexual harassment as kids. Hindi ito yung kaso na na-rape or pinilit gumawa ng malaswa but it's very close to that. For my case, mga kamag-anak o kakilala ng kamag-anak ang palaging gumagawa. Kesyo habang naglalaro ipipilit na ipasok yung kamay sa shorts or sometimes straight up mimomolestiya kapag natutulog. 

The degree varied by person but the formula remained largely the same. The older relative pretends that it's something kids do habang alam ng bata na may mali sa nangyayari. Some dismiss it as child's play later on, while others are scarred by it until now. 

This leads up to my question now. Gaano ba kadalas yung mga kaso na ganito at bakit parang hindi to big deal until umabot sa punto na child trafficking or child pornography na yung resulta?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/8hdk6r/nsfwtriggering_how_high_are_cases_of_children/,t2_11wjlt,1525589666.0

TW: Sexual Abuse

I'm a graduating college student who's doing thesis research, and are looking for groups on where i could find respondents for my research.

I'm looking for people who are victims of sexual abuse and for credibility and for their safety also, I'm planning to inquire or ask those who are part of recovery/protection/support groups sana as I don't want to cause any more trauma or harm to them.

My study and questions have been approved by a Social Worker, a psychologist and fellow victims. So i am quite sure it is safe. And I issue a waiver and consent form for condentiality and for the protection of respondents too

Any suggestions on who i could contact?
Thank in advance!

Edit: looking for adults sana, they will be interviewed kasi. So i can't choose children victims.

Edit 2: any form of SA survivors is okay. Either they experienced it during their childhood or in their adult hood. What's important is for them to be consenting adults.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/svbnhw/any_orgsgroupsngos_that_support_or_cater_victims/,t2_6x8x1it5,1645167803.0

I'm terrified of our justice system (TW: sexual abuse),"As most of you know, throughout Du30's presidency many people have fallen victim to the war on drugs and corrupt police. That's already enough of a red flag to show that the justice system doesn't have our back, even if we are innocent. 

Because of this, I'm terrified of reporting the man who raped me. 
Our senate is working on raising the age of consent from 12 to 16, which is very promising. 

But this is what happened to me, and along the way, you'd probably think, wow, what a dumbass, this could've been prevented, and you'd be right. Which is why I haven't come forward. :

When I was 14, I was raped by a man 12 years older who I thought was my friend, in his mom's house, at 6pm. Although I said no, pushed him, and cried, he didn't stop, because I froze. 
Afterwards he told me we had ""made love"" and all that was going through my head was that I was now stuck with him because god sees those we fornicate with as our spouse. I figured I had to stay, so I did stay. And for 4 years too, it was horrible. He cheated on me multiple times, shouted at me so much my ears rang each time, and he gave me anxiety of ever being in a similar situation. I could type for hours and not even describe how awful it was, it was a 'you had to be there to understand' type of thing. He even forced me on birth control which lead to dysmenorrhea, which disappeared when I stopped taking the pill. Financially abused me, where I didn't get to eat as much and was never a healthy weight.

This man fucked with my life, my adolescence for years, and I feel awful knowing he gets away with it because the justice system won't have my back, because I stayed, I stuck around no matter how bad it got because of the grooming, and in the end, he knows I've smoked marijuana to get away from him, it calmed me down enough to stay away and not go back out of loneliness. 
I can't report him because our justice system won't see how he abused me, they'll see that I did something illegal, stayed with a guy that I ""loved"" and that it's a case to throw out.

But in all this time I've had away from him, I've learnt that I'm not the only woman, or person who has gone through this. All the cases unfiled because we know the justice system won't have our back. 

Thank you for reading, this was more like an 
r/confession or a ramble that I needed off my chest.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/m9pco9/im_terrified_of_our_justice_system_tw_sexual_abuse/,t2_5crgk57q,1616304518.0

TW: Verbal sexual abuse.

Teacher yun kaibigan ko sa isang public school and binabastos sya ng mga estudyante behind her back. Nadulas lang yun isang bata (junior high but currently repeating the grade for the nth time) sa isa pang teacher kaya nalaman nya hanggang sa kinausap ng kaibigan ko. Dun nya nalaman na pinapagusapan sya and kung ano ano sinasabi sa kanya regarding her physical features and what they will do to her. Sobrang nakakagalit lang kasi mga bata ito and kawawa yun kaibigan ko, hindi na sya makaharap sa mga estudyante para makapagturo kasi naiisip nya yun sinasabi ng mga bata tungkol sa kanya.

We plan to pursue legal action against the students involved kasi mukhang di ito papansinin ng school. Kaso mukhang yun law is for protecting students lang. Any legal advice kung ano possible na gawin sa students na nambabastos ng teacher? I think this is verbal sexual abuse na. May magagawa ba kami dito?

Yes, it was originally made as a safe zone to express one's sexuality and explore. But nowadays, it's a haven for illegal explicit videos that are being traded/sold/pinagpipiyestahan ng mga tao. Recorded videos of innocent people (nowadays more of men and even CHILDREN) are being peddled for a few hundred pesos while anonymous accounts lustfully demand for names/social media links of the victims.

Nakakagalit!! I've been endlessly reporting the accounts over weeks now, but Twitter seems to not care! And even if they get suspended, babalik ang mga account na parang wala lang.

Wala ba talaga tayong magagawa para mahinto sila? Imagine your friends, sibling, parents, anyone you know being sold online without their consent. There are so many issues in our country right now, heck some of these accounts are even one in speaking up against the terror-bill AND YET sila pa mismo ang nagkakalat ng masasamang kalakaran! The audacity.

I'm sorry if this is coming off as a rant, but I just want and demand justice for all the victims. I am so angry that many people still resort to victim blaming because ""they asked for it by masturbating on cam online."" Hello?? That's the same logic of people who say rape victims are raped because of how they dress.  I hate how these anonymous accounts feel they are powerful and immortal by hiding behind their fake accounts while the lives of real people are being ruined! As much as I would not want to blame the alter community, first of all, parang wala pa akong nakikitang effort from them to really work and speak-up against these horrible traders/bosera. How can you defend a community that flourishes from illegal trades and remains mum on these crimes? There are some anonymous accounts on IG and Twitter that try to expose these catfishing/bosera/trading scams, but it seems their voices aren't being heard. Heck, even the reports from Rappler and ABS-CBN have now died down. I just hope NBI is really doing something because it's so frustrating :( 

There's got to be a way to raise more awareness, to shut these accounts and people down, to help the victims of these SEX CRIMES. If anyone can help, please. Please do. My heart aches for victims of sexual abuse, and this is something that we Filipinos should be aware of, and should also do something about.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/h81f7j/is_there_something_we_can_do_to_address_image/,t2_6wpm7ab3,1592026416.0

Sexual Deviancy is so normalized in the PH,"Me and my boyfriend have gone to the same school since elementary. Recently, he told me about the photo drive that had been going around the guys in the school of people’s nudes and upskirt pictures (all probably shared unconsensually). I already knew about the drive some time ago but I was surprised to learn about the names of the people he knew used it and added some of their own. These are people I practically grew up knowing, some I’m even friends with or have dated. Basically, pretty much 2/3rds of the men in my batch. (I can’t do anything about it now. We’ve all graduated a few years ago and some of the people involved are from political dynasties or absurdly rich families. There’s also very little proof)

That conversation resurfaced again when a friend of mine confided in me that her VERY recent ex had apparently sent their sex tape to a similar drive but ended up getting blackmailed into giving the owner money to have it deleted. It takes sm trust and love for a girl to let you record/keep explicit media like that and the moment they broke up, he ran to use it for his own gain.

I have so many other stories like this. I cannot recall any girl I’m close to not having been taken advantage of sexually in any way. I’m one of the lucky few. Why is this so common, especially in the PH? It makes my heart hurt how sm of these people get to walk around and live normal lives.

Edit: a lot of people seem to be talking about how the solution would be to just exercise caution and not take explicit photos/videos. While that is an important sentiment, the school drive I was talking about was actually mostly made up of pictures taken from under the skirts of girls without their knowledge. There is only so much a girl can do to prevent these things, especially when you’re 12-15 and don’t really think it’ll happen to you.

Also, I do think this discussion is especially relevant to our country considering we were recently ranked 2nd worldwide for online sexual abuse.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/18s6rf7/sexual_deviancy_is_so_normalized_in_the_ph/,t2_ej0g8wm5,1703700013.0

Why do Westerners find the concept of having house help a little inhumane?,"TLDR:
I think foreigners’ finding the concept of househelp inhumane is ethnocentric and a little strange.

I’m open to having my mind changed though.

—

For context, I saw a clip of Anthony Bourdain talking and calling out some Singaporeans who say they don’t know how to do laundry because they’re used to having house help and the comments were eating it up, calling them privileged, spoiled brats.

Many of the comments were calling them babies and needing to be taken down a notch.

Bourdain (half jokingly) calls them out of touch bourgeois, working class abusers ( as in abuses the working class, not literal legal abusing.)

This is a sentiment I often heae from Westerners. They feel deeply uncomfortable at the thought of hiring help for the kids or home.

I, despite having a privileged background, grew up without a maid so I know how to do literally all house chores, with maybe the exception of ironing. Well, I know how to, I’m just not good at it.

Despite this, I never found issue with my friends having maids. In my mind, it’s employing people to do a job.  You pay them the same way you pay the housekeepers at a hotel.

I don’t understand why many Westerners find the practice abhorrent and medieval.

Of course, abused help (sexually, physically, verbally) is terrible and is a different story, but I mean literally paying someone to do a service seems pretty straightforward.

We even call them “kasambahay” like “people who have the same home.” And for many of my friends’ maids they call my friends their “alaga.”

Even in media like Jody Sta Maria’s“Be Careful with My Heart”, the house help (several) and the family driver are shown as characters who work for Richard Yap and have a healthy working relationship. Jody Sta Maria’s character witholding 😅

Edit: since some people are bringing up uniforms, I have a very uncommon view on this. I’m actually pro-uniform. Nothing degrading or caricature-esque, just like a polo shirt or whatever.

As someone who employs people for my business, they were SO happy when I asked them if they wanted us to make a uniform they could wear.

They said it made them feel like part of the team.

When I worked corporate, I also liked wearing company shirts. Idk maybe I have a weird perspective, I feel like I look professional / respectable when I’m in “work attire.” (Usually a polo shirt with a logo)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/188tlok/why_do_westerners_find_the_concept_of_having/,t2_782ciygg,1701484838.0

PSA - Mga Saksi ni Jehova balik Door to Door na.,"Mag-ingat sa mga Saksi ni Jehova, They are a Cult.
Dahil ipinagutos na nang Governing Body nila na magbahay bahay na ngayong setyembre, makikita ninyo na ulit sila lalo na tuwing sabado at linggo.

Please research them first sa Google before deciding to have a bible study with them. Although mababait na tao naman ang mga saksi, their teachings and policies are a danger to the public and their members.

Things to consider:

1. There is a lot of Child Sexual Abuse cases na nagaganap against their religion. You don't want your kids to be associated with this cult. Their policy for Child Sexual Abuse is appaling.
2. Ihihiwalay ka nila sa mga kaibigan at kamag-anak mong hindi mga saksi. No more birthdays, Christmas, JS prom, anything na makakasama mo mga kamag-anak at kaibigan mo para mag saya at mag celebrate. Worldly, bad influence ang tingin nila sa mga hindi kasapi. In short, i iisolate ka sa mga taong totoong nagmamahal at nagmamalasakit sa iyo.
3. No Blood Transfusion policy sila. Mas okay na mamatay ang member nila kesa suwayin ang interpretasyon nang kanilang leader. Even mga magulang na Saksi mas gugutuhin pang mamatay anak nila kesa salinan nang dugo dahil meron naman daw pag kabuhay muli.
4. Shunning Policy. Kapag itiniwalag ang isa, hindi na siya pwedeng kausapin nang lahat nang mga Saksi ni Jehova. Even your own mother and father will shun you. Kahit anak mo pa yan, bawal mong kausapin (kapag hindi na nakatira sa bahay mo anak mo). Maraming nag susuicide dahil hindi nila nakayanan ang lungkot nang mawalay sa pamilya dahil lang sa turo nilang ito.
5. Multiple prophecy failures. Inihula nila na darating ang wakas sa mga taong ito: 1914, 1925, 1975 and the 20th century. Ilang sa mga miyembro nito ay nagbenta nang ari arian, bahay, mga hindi nakapagtapos nang pag-aaral. Dinidiscourage ang pagkuha nang higher education (College and University)
6. Marami pang iba. If you want more info about them you can visit this website: [https://jwfacts.com](https://jwfacts.com) it is a website that criticizes this religion. You can see that their own literature debunks their teachings, and the amount of inconsistency with their core beliefs are enormous. 

Pero please, although hindi talaga okay mga turo nila. Mababait na tao mga saksi ni jehova, nga lang brain controlled nang kanilang mga leader. Kaya hangga't maaari, wag natin silang pag sarhan nang pinto, sigawan o anumang hindi magandang gawin sa isang tao. Lalo lang silang hihigpit sa pagkakahawak sa kultong ito. Magalang na sabihin na hindi ka interesado or if ayaw mo talagang maistorbo sabihin mo na ""Apostata"" ka, sobrang takot jan mga Saksi ni Jehova.

TLDR: Mag-ingat sa mga Saksi ni Jehova they are a CULT.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/x44l87/psa_mga_saksi_ni_jehova_balik_door_to_door_na/,t2_dj6r7bh,1662132979.0
Cutting ties with family and moving to the province,"Hi. To make a long story short, I was sexually abused as a child by the husbands of my mother and aunt. The assaults happened separately and several times. It started when I was around 11 years old and I already told my family years ago. They didn’t really believe me though. Anyway, I endured it because I was just a student back then who had no way of supporting herself. I never confronted them again and we all just acted like nothing happened.

Fast forward to today where I had a fight with my aunt about a different issue. During the fight, she told me that she put up with all my issues before and almost separated from her husband because of it. Issues meaning my sexual abuse. I snapped. I couldn’t believe she would treat it as if it was my fault that her husband molested me. I just sat there while she screamed at me because I was too devastated to even speak. All these years, I endured seeing my abusers regularly just to keep the family’s peace tapos parang kasalanan ko pa pala.

But the abuse isn’t my main issue. My issue is that I need to leave ASAP. I can’t bear to stay in the same house as my aunt anymore. Now, the problem is that I currently live in Dubai with her. And yes, I pay her rent around 15k PHP monthly. 

I’m 27F and a licensed CPA. I also have around 400k PHP in savings. While crying hiding away in the bathroom, I googled best provinces to live in the Philippines and came across Davao. I bought a one way ticket that departs tomorrow afternoon. I have no clue where I’m going to stay and I’ve never even been to Mindanao before. 

If anyone can please give me any advice or suggestions about staying in Davao, I’d be very grateful. Right now, my head is just a mess and I can’t make any concrete plans. 

Thanks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/111b0h2/cutting_ties_with_family_and_moving_to_the/,t2_bi88509,1676299985.0

Child grooming in the Philippines,"I am a victim of child grooming during my adolescence and as an advocacy, I want to conduct a research about the lived experiences of my fellow victims who have survived. This is for the purpose of raising awareness and prevention. Does anyone here want to share their story? Preferably Filipino victims. Rest assured this will be confidential and private. You can hide your identity. 

Let's chat more about the details if you guys are interested.


For those who doesn't know what grooming is:

Grooming is when someone (adult) builds a relationship, trust and emotional connection with a child or young person to increase the likelihood of manipulation, exploitation and sexual abuse. A groomer can be someone in the environment of the child. For example, teacher, family friend, relative, pastor, and etc. They can be anyone. 

Stages in the process of grooming involves 
(1) Targeting potential victims 
(2) Building trust and friendship 
(3) Isolating the child 
(4) Initiation of abuse and maintaining secrecy

Grooming can go unnoticed because the groomer usually befriends and builds trust with the victim's guardians and other people in the community in order for them not be suspicious of the perpetrator's actions.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/qxykcd/child_grooming_in_the_philippines/,t2_c5x0t2oz,1637385539.0

Experiences of being born to interfaith parents.,"Si Nanay ay isang Sunni Muslim at si Tatay ay isang Roman Catholic.

Despite their different religions, they love each other and used the religions they were born with to connect each other further and look beyond their respective religions to see the forest for the trees.

Pero, their marriage strained their relationships with their respective families. Kaya ayaw ni Nanay palapitin yung pamilya niya sa akin at mga kapatid ko.

Yung pamilya ni Nanay, felt betrayed that she loves someone outside their faith and is openly aggressive towards Tatay. Conversely, yung pamilya ni Tatay resents him for loving someone outside their faith, except they are more passive aggressive about it.

Whenever my lolo (dad's dad) is around, he can't stop making tasteless jokes about my mother ""having a bombed strapped under her shirt."" My Tatay kept on telling Lolo to stop with such jokes but kept on going until he stopped bringing Nanay with him whenever he visits Lolo.

Apart from that, I have been keeping a secret from my parents that I am highly agnostic at this point like most of my best friends and classmates are. I have always been afraid of coming out as agnostic to them. Also, I am bisexual as well. While my parents seem fine with the LGBTQ+ Community and thinks that God/Allah allows them to do whatever they want, I am still scared of admitting my bisexuality and agnosticism to my parents.

Nevertheless, good thing my parents are quick to condemn the shenanigans of the Catholic sexual abuse scandals and all of those Islamist terrorist massacres.

Honestly, I think the ""Makadiyos"" should not refer to a specific god at all and should refer to any god of any religion. The Philippines should be more inclusive towards not just Muslims, but also other religions as well.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/18ecc0g/experiences_of_being_born_to_interfaith_parents/,t2_h3q1rhe0w,1702123899.0

My aunt recently went through my things, read my journal, and took pictures of it. She also made PHYSICAL COPIES and distributed it to our employees. She says she’ll file a case against me because of what I wrote about her. 

Is there anything I can do to stop her from distributing the pictures she took? 

I want to prevent her from spreading this in the future. I’m afraid she’ll post it online, there was one entry about how I was sexually abused in school.

I have an older brother who has autism and have >!sexually assaulted!< me when I was young but nobody believes me since he's ""autistic"". He has also let out his anger on me whenever he had tantrums growing up, and it only recently stopped.

I have been diagnosed with a dependent personality disorder, depression, and anxiety.>! I have attempted suicide on multiple occasions but failed. My family makes me want to kill myself everyday.!<

The abuse is very apparent everyday, and I swore to the day I turned 18, I will move out. My mother has taken my legal documents, (which I have on me again temporarily, I used university applications as an excuse for her to give it to me.) My bank account is legally still bounded to my mother so any transactions I make, she can see. If I try to do anything with it, she will beat the life out of me.

My sister doesn't help. She would do everything to snitch on any attempt she catches me that is against my parents' house rules. I don't even see her as my own sister anymore.

I've considered moving out of the country just to cut all contacts with them.

I don't have any jobs that pays, but I want to so I could be able to financially help myself. I want to move out to a safer place. Someone, please, help me. I don't have anyone to turn to.

EDIT (as of 11:54 AM, 24/11/2021):  
To everyone who have gave an advice, reached out through dms, sent encouraging messages, gave loving comments, and gentle reminders to take care of myself—thank you. With my utmost sincerity, and wholeheartedly, want to let you know that I appreciate each, and every single one of you. I have teared up and even sobbed because I'm quite a stranger to this act of kindness as I was deprived of this growing up. 

I used to think that living life was impossible for someone like me, pero naiintindihan ko rin na it will get better as long as I try to keep fighting and finding better ways to cope. It's really hard to live in the same house of your abusers, hence why I am trying to leave. I will take all of your advice that are logical, safe, and ensured to put me in a better place.

I love you all. Thank you.

I'll update in the near future, or a year or two from now.

May nakakaalam ba ng title ng indie movie na to?,"I watched an indie movie back in a film-showing we had at my college from local small directors. It was a post-apocalyptic short film entirely shot in a dingy room where a father's chained to a corner and his daughter comes in to hand him some food because it's his birthday. The dad' sort of pissed because his daughter's kind of teasing him about his miserable and it's heavily implied that she had to restrain him because he was physically abusive. It's even hinted that he was sexually abusing her (his own UNDERAGE DAUGHTER) when she does an erotic dance to torment him to send a message of ""you can't get this, it's just out of reach"". Dad can't take it anymore and kills himself (I forgot how) then the camera pans to some keys and it's revealed that the girl was going to free him as his ""birthday gift"".

Bakit mabait parents niyo? (Chos haha. Pero di nga? As in, lumaki sa bugbog pero na-break yung cycle?) Halos lahat kasi ng nakapaligid sakin ay galing sa abusive na pamilya e. Nabubugbog, Na Molestiya, Verbally Abused—yung tipong tatapak tapakan pa yung pangarap mo. Tas hinihingan lagi ng pera pang shoppee (weird form of abuse. Abuse ba to? Pero imagine kasi wala na kayong makain buong pamily tas nagtatrabaho ka para makakain ka at makapag-ipon ng sarili mong pampaaral, tas hihingin ng magulang mo para lang mag shopping?) Ako naman lumaking emotionally neglected. Ang hirap isipin kung pano umakto ang healthy and supportive family. Obviously di sila abusive pero kasi, pano yung support and communication niyo? Tangina kahit ikwento mo talambuhay mo babasahin ko yan para lang malaman at maintindihan ko kung pano nagwowork ang healthy fam.

Don't get me wrong, I know healthy families and good parents exist here. But I can't imagine talaga kung pano sila... Umasta? It's easier to imagine abusive families because that's what I know.

(Weird post pero kailangan ko po kasi as reference sa ginagawa ko.)

(Welcome din yung mga magcomment about sa abusive household nila. Babasahin ko rin para maintindihan kung bakit grabe na talaga minsan yung ibang magulang. Emotional neglect lang akin e.

3. Huge amout of money was spent just to promote a cause but it could've been better if the money utilized for the pageant was directly used for the cause;
4. Highly susceptible to sexual abuse/harassment between the candidates and the organizers/judges.

"[SERIOUS] Hardcore religious people of PH, what are your thoughts regarding Pope Francis's recent comment about homosexuality?","For those who are not aware of it, Pope Francis told a Chilean(?) gay guy who was sexually abused by a Chilean priest that 'God made him like that and love you like that.'

This was a big deal knowing that the church treats homosexuality as a sin and is very much opposing the law of God.

My mom is not a hardcore religious person but she prays every meal, 'attends' mass every sunday through The Healing Eucharist on ABS CBN and has this Sto.

Am I just making excuses?,"Hi! I'm 23f and supposedly graduating na ako this year pero I stopped during pandemic and worked as csr. So 2nd year palang ako this year and I feel like di ko kaya yung tinitake kong course so I want to shift kaso nagiguilty din ako kasi sayang yung oras. Ako yung panganay samin. I have 2 younger brothers na wala pang 20 and both nakabuntis na . Product kami ng broken family and both parents have new partners now. I have 5 half siblings. Nagpalaki samin yung lola namin(father side)  tapos kasama din namin isang pinsan na lalaki na few years older than me. Lagi kaming binubugbog before and he was also sexually abusing me and I feel like isa sya sa mga factors na nagshape samin kung naging anong klaseng tao kami. My 2 brothers were involved in drugs before I'm not entirely sure if they stopped now. During elem and hs macoconsider na ""matalino"" ako. Idk if it's because wala naman kami sa city kaya wala din masyadong competition. When I was grade 7 muntik na akong ma rape nung papa nung pinsan ko na nang aabuse samin and nung grade 8 limipat ako sa aunt ko tapos medyo bastos din yung husband nya. Nung grade 9 ako nilipat naman ako sa lola ko sa mother side and may nangyari na naman na sexual abuse galing sa half brother ng mama ko. I never felt like someone cared about me. Before pag may hinihingi ako sa papa ko magpapromise lang pero  hindi tinutupad. Pero pag yung mga kapatid ko binibigay kaagad. And now I feel like a complete failure. Currently yung bf ko nagsusupport sakin and nahihiya na talaga ako sa kanya. Nasasayangan din sya sa oras if magshishift ako kaso feel ko talaga ayoko na mag aral. Gusto ko nalang mamatay and naghahanap lang ako ng best way para mamatay yung quick way lang sana. Feel ko my past will always haunt me and I'll never heal.

At 19, Kat, a British Filipina, was a rising TV star, hosting a popular show in the Philippines. However, her life took a harrowing turn when she was drugged and raped by a fellow celebrity. Faced with a cultural dilemma between seeking justice and remaining silent in a society that often blames rape victims, Kat chose the latter, preserving her privacy in a patriarchal setting.

Despite her successful career, including hosting for MTV and appearing on billboards, Kat grappled with her trauma. Years later, when other women came out and accused the same perpetrator, she bravely used her platform to defend them, facing severe backlash and career repercussions.

Kat's turning point was a courageous decision to share her story on a live podcast. Despite fears, she was determined after hearing a friend's similar experience. Her openness led to online abuse and threats, isolating her from her support system. However, a transformative moment at a mountain event, where a stranger recognised and praised her bravery, marked a significant shift in her journey.

Kat’s story is not just personal; it reflects a larger narrative of combating GBV and Online GBV (OGBV). Today, Kat is a multifaceted artist and advocate against rape in the Philippines. As a survivor, she has been fighting a very public battle with rape in the local media. Using her experience, Kat is active behind the scenes – producing, directing, and writing stories for movies and series. She also founded Empower, a non-profit organisation focusing on the compassionate education of the Filipino people, aiming to end the stigma around rape and sexual abuse. Kat has actively engaged in school seminars, spoken at prominent universities and schools, and even delivered a TEDx talk titled “Is rape culture the new social cancer?” Collaborating with organisations like the Office of the Vice President and embassies of Sweden and the UK, she works to improve the understanding and handling of rape and rape survivors in the country.

two men abused me,"Trigger warning: sex, abuse, pedophilia. 

Pedophilia and sexual abuse are rampant in the Philippines, it is a disgusting and inhumane act that is preserved by people in the deep dark corners of our country. However, what's more, depressing is the fact that male victims are often overlooked by the law of our society. I am going to share my story as someone who experienced a travesty that until today affects me. This is my first time sharing this. 

Hello, I am currently a 24-year-old male, and I never really talked to anyone about what I experienced. 

It happened in 2006 in San Juan City, in a gated compound. Inside that compound, there was a massage (hilot) service, and my grandparents frequently went there after a hard day of driving since it was cheap. I met my assailants when my grandmother brought me along to the compound when she was going to get a massage so that I could accompany her. While she was getting her massage, I was wandering around the compound

Two people took notice and approached me and I still, for the life of me, can't remember their names, so I am gonna call them Glasses and Skinny based on how I remember what they look like -- one was tall (5'6) and wearing glasses, white skin, straight hair, medium size build with clean-cut. The other guy was shorter (5'4), thin with, brownish skin, and also has short and straight hair. They asked my name and what was I doing inside the compound, then after telling them, Glasses invited me to his apartment so that I could wait there comfortably, and because I was a gullible and ignorant child I accepted their invite. 

I saw their Play Station and their SEGA Dream Cast and they were kind enough to let me play their consoles, they also gave me food and drinks while I was waiting for my grandmother. Well, as a poor boy it was a dream come true to play consoles. I went to check the screen door to see if my grandmother was done with her massage, and she was, so I left their house, and went home. 

The next day, I went back to the compound because I was excited to play their consoles again, and they did, they were good people or so I thought and, this continued for two days. It was April 22, 200,6 when it happened, I went back to my supposed friends in the compound and while we were playing, they asked me to go upstairs because they want me to show a ""magic trick"", and I did. We were inside a bedroom, then both of them approached the bed and I clearly remember what they told me ""ang galing nito, tignan mo"". (This is amazing, look at this)

Skinny layed down on the bed while Glasses was on his knees above him. Glasses then proceeded to remove the shorts of Skinny. I saw his penis, and I felt nervous and confused, then Glasses started to put Skinny's penis inside his mouth, then out, and inside again, then they switched positions. After they were done, they told me 

""Diba ang galing? Ikaw naman ah"" (Isn't it amazing, now you try it) 

I told them, ""Ayoko po, gusto ko na umuwi"" (I don't want to, I want to go home)

I wasn't able to move an inch, I was nervous and scared of what I witnessed. Skinny lifted me and placed me on the bed, Glasses took my shorts off and he did what he did, while Skinny was moving my hand to stroke his penis. Luckily enough, penetration didn't occur. I went silent after what happened to me, ever since then I have had e a certain fear and level of discomfort towards sexual encounters or sex itself. I feel uncomfortable about the topic or the concept itself. 

For sixteen years I've kept this all to myself because I never really understood what happened since I was only eight at the time that it happened. 

Sexual violence is genderless, and it can happen to anyone. It does not choose your gender or sexual orientation, what you wear and what you look like. Everyone can be a victim.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/uszg4v/two_men_abused_me/,t2_i3njf5ye,1652952010.0

In the Name of God (Netflix) Philippine Version,"Hi guys! Has anyone watched the documentary of a cult leader in Korea doing dirty jobs towards his followers? After watching about Jung Myung Seok controversy and crimes, I immediately remember we also have this kind of cult leader here in the Philippines — Apollo Quiboloy. 

The Kingdom of Jesus Christ ministry is an exploitative organization where they make their followers as, basically, slaves and thinking that they were doing free labor in the name of God. Just how Jung Myung Seok sexually assaulted his followers, Quiboloy was wanted in the US for the same reason (sex trafficking women and children). 

How could I say this? Because I was also a former member of the ministry. Fortunately, I have not been sexually assaulted, rather, I had firsthand experience of how exploitative the “Kingdom of Jesus Christ” was. The ministry does not care about your welfare — even if your a child, a woman, or a senior citizen. Their organization is always grounded with intimidation, coercion, and exploitation. In addition, Quiboloy is also a fake news peddler through his network channel SMNI.

I hope Netflix could also shed some light for the victims of Quiboloy’s abusive system, just how they turned the world against the sex-maniac cult leader, Jung Myung Seok.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/11lyuz8/in_the_name_of_god_netflix_philippine_version/,t2_6jzewx7i9,1678288443.0
my experience with sexual harassment,"hi. i just really need to get this out my chest. earlier, i watched an animation in yt about a little girl who was sexually abused. and the video made my heart ache. when i was a child, i couldn't do anything. i felt so helpless, i couldn't tell anyone about my experience. and until now, i'm still having difficulties to tell my experience to my parents. i really really want to tell them but i'm afraid of how they wouldn't believe me since it all happened to me too young, that it was only a figment of my childhood imagination. but i know it isn't, it felt too real to be an imagination. and it didn't happen once, it happened twice and my tito did it to me. not only that, his brother, that i used to be close with, almost harassed me and it happened last year. i managed to maintain a distance from him but didn't tell my parents the incident since he was drunk and i wanted to understand him because he was one of my favorite titos. i want to speak up, i badly want to, but i'm afraid i would ruin their already ruined family more and i'm also afraid no adult will believe me. up until now, those experiences haunt me. i can still feel everything that my tito did to me. maybe that's the reason why he always gives me money when he sees me up until now. i just hope he doesn't do what he did to me to his daughter considering he has a family now. and that's the other reason why i can't speak up. what if he changed? what if he's a good father and a good husband? i might scar his children for life. i can't do that to my cousins.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/q76c8t/my_experience_with_sexual_harassment/,t2_bqxrp58d,1634111763.0

Opinions regarding Mandatory ROTC,"Just curious. I'm a grade 11 going on 12 student, and I'm a bit shaken about the possibility of the implementation of ROTC in my school next year.

But I have read that it was removed 18 years ago because of the shady things that happened because of the ROTC, e.g. korporasyon, torture, sexual abuse, and even death (that one case that happened in UST).

So what are your opinions on this? And if bad things like that have happened before, who's to say that it won't happen again?

VP Leni should reconsider her stand on divorce.,"For context: In the CNN Presidential Debate VP Leni is against legalizing divorce but pushed for annulment by making it much more accessible to the poor. 

However, an annulment is much harder to receive than a divorce -  proving the marriage was void or null is harder than getting a divorce. 

According to Google, a divorce ends a legal marriage and declares the spouses to be single again. Annulment: A legal ruling that erases a marriage by declaring the marriage null and void and that the union was never legally valid. However, even if the marriage is erased, the marriage records remain on file.

Abused Filipino women are hoping divorce will become legal and claiming that 'they almost died'. (ABS-CBN 2018) 

Marriage can only be annulled on limited grounds, such as insanity or contracting a sexually transmitted disease. Abuse and infidelity are not valid reasons. The Supreme Court has also stressed this back then in 2013 that spousal abuse is not grounds for annulment. 

As of now, Philippines is the only last country in the world where divorce is illegal. I feel irritated that the nation still clings to the teachings of the church - this is not 15th century. Society keeps moving forward and the needs of the society can't be met by the laws of the church. We are not a theocracy, but democracy. 

Leni is still my candidate as she is the most deserving and capable out of all the presidential candidates, but I feel like her view on the issue of divorce is something that needs to be reconsidered seriously. Even she is against abortion. 

Please share me your thoughts. I may be wrong since I'm not a lawyer myself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/t2p44l/vp_leni_should_reconsider_her_stand_on_divorce/,t2_d0yobg9k,1645971330.0

Conservatism,"I don't know if I'm the only one who really despise conservatism in an unimaginable level but it feels like our nation still clings to it despite the damage it had brought to us.

When I was a child, my Dad used to tell me that I shall go to the military, thinking that it should cure me—being a queer.

Since I am the eldest son, they always say that I must give them grandchildren.

There's all this toxic back and forth verbal and physical abuse, you know, typical queer person with a conservative family.

And I think, all of these gaslight and derailment had distorted my present self, because I don't know how to express myself and my sexual orientation without sounding off and abnormal.

Is it legal to run away at 21?,"Hello I have a question po, is it legal to run away at the age of 21 po? 
For starters, I live in a very toxic household po. When I was a minor I was sexually assaulted by my own relatives tapos nalaman ng mom ko pero di ako pinaniwalaan. Pinaghingi pa ko ng sorry in front of my own abusers. Mas lalo pa pong lumala after nun, maraming strict rules, maraming di pwede, lahat sila nagdedesisyon para sa'kin kahit po legal age nako. Napagsasabihan din po ako ng mga masasakit na salita. Di ko po naranasan yung salitang freedom, kahit anong gawin ko laging may puna, laging may mali sa'kin, puro takot at kaba lang nararamdaman ko kapag kinakausap nila ako, wala na pong pagmamahal.
I'm already an adult po, I know that at gusto ko na pong maglayas talaga, kaya nga lang po tinatakot po nila ako na kesyo ipapapulis daw po kung sino mang kukupkop sa'kin tapos ipapa tv pa daw po na missing person at ipopost pic ko sa social media pag naglayas daw po ako. Actually nangyari na po ito before when I was 17, not to that extent pero minessage po lahat ng friends classmates ko lahat lahat. Ayoko na po sana maulit yon.

Balik po tayo sa question, may magagawa po ba sila legally if ever maglayas po ulit ako? May maicocomplain or maikakaso po ba? Natatakot po kasi ako pero at the same time ang toxic na po, nasasakal na ako, wala na pong freedom, saka puro takot at kaba nalang po nararamdaman ko, nandun din yung trauma na naranasan ko dahil sa pangmomolestya sa'kin. Ano po bang maipapayo niyo? Thank you sana maaapprove and thank you sa sasagot.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/15ukyrv/is_it_legal_to_run_away_at_21/,t2_bjwxgrx28,1692366201.0
What do you think about these BBM arguments?,"I had a discussion with a friend today on why he is not voting for LGR, and why he is voting for 88M 

I just want to hear your thoughts or rebuttals. 

1. LGR will become a puppet of her supporters. How are we so sure that instead of keeping her campaign promises, she would instead continue the status quo by listening to the oligarchs ""volunteering"" for her campaign? 

2. LGR does not have a clear platform on solving corruption. I responded to this with ""by making government transactions more transparent."" And my friend countered by stating that it is dangerous to divulge government transactions, and that there are already systems in place where you can ask for a record of government transactions and it will be provided for you. My friend admitted though that 88M has no platform for fighting corruption. 

3. LGR's campaign is based on deception because she states that even though she is running as an independent candidate, she has a lot of allies/backers from the liberal party, most notably, she has Bam Aquino as her campaign manager. My friends says, ""Why masquerade as something else when you can just say you're with the liberal party."" 

4. LGR is being paraded as a messianic figure by the Catholic church. ""How can the church call LGR the morally good candidate, and 88M the liar and the thief, when the church itself is rife with issues of corruption and sexual abuses?"" So I said, ""Don't you think that's an appeal to hypocrisy?"" Then he continues to elaborate, ""It applies to this matter because the church is being hypocritical beacuse they are out for Narcos Sr.'s and 88M's head, yet they can't give up their pedophile priests to the courts?"" 

In the end, my friend admitted that he would vote for Leni if she had better people surrounding her.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/uhdtvi/what_do_you_think_about_these_bbm_arguments/,t2_dp0puzh,1651576848.0
"For fellow survivors, it's been a day full of triggers","This is in relation to several posts and media coverage of the rape-slay of the PAL flight attendant. Like many others that come before, discussions about sexual abuse and victim-blaming can be very toxic times especially on Philippine online platforms, particularly Facebook and Twitter. What most Filipinos do not know is that there are probably some victims and survivors of rape within their circles (friends, work spaces, family, other networks, church, etc). Your co-worker, sister/brother, or your close friend may not tell you about their experiences but there are a lot of us out there, probably healing on our own or denying that help is available due to fear of stigma and unhealthy practices such as victim-blaming.

This comes from someone who was molested as young as 4 years old by an older male cousin. My sister experienced the same, too, when she was still a kid, also by the same cousin. In 2018, I was raped while I was drunk in a bar in Makati. I brought myself to the police and had to undergo through investigation and hospital checkups by myself, so I know how isolating it feels like. Choosing to hide it or refusing help is always the easier choice, due to fear of other people feeling bad for you. Like most cases of rape in this country, the rapist never faced the consequences of their actions, leaving me more broken than I already was. Unlike the PAL flight attendant, my experiences from childhood and the recent rape morphed into another major problem as I abused alcohol to numb my fears, insecurities, and anxiety. 

If you are a victim or a survivor reading this, you can take a step back and avoid social media if it doesn't make you feel like it's a safe space. There are more of us out there, and we see you.
