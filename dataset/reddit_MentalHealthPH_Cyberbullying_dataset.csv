Please help me finish my grad school thesis :(,"Hi, i'm unsure if this is allowed here. But I would like to ask for help in finishing my research so I can finally graduate. I've been taking my master's degree since 2014 and have been stuck with thesis since \~2017. I've changed my adviser and topics a couple of times already.

Currently taking MS Psychology, and my research is about cyberbullying. I'm looking for Filipino citizens between 22-28 y/o who have experienced being cyberbullied when they were 13-17 y/o.

If you fit the description, please help me out by answering an initial screening questionnaire here: [bit.ly/CyberbullyingPHResearch](https://bit.ly/CyberbullyingPHResearch) (this'll take about 5-10 minutes)

Those who would pass the initial screening would be contacted for an interview (about 1 hr.) about your cyberbullying experience. If u happen to know someone who might be interested, feel free to forward the link to them. Thank u!!!!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/xf6hn2/please_help_me_finish_my_grad_school_thesis/,t2_8ma8e02g,2022-09-16 04:06:07,1,1
Could this be a trigger?,For some context: I was cyberbullied and constantly roped into arguments by someone I thought of as a best friend. When something makes me think of being friends or emotionally close to someone outside of my family it feels like I'm back in some of the worse arguments/pranks and I start feeling stupid for the fact that I trusted her and thought this was normal. I also start getting really panicked and fidgety and for the most part it's really hard to calm down. But it might not be a trigger because it doesn't affect me if it's someone else being friends or emotionally close to others.,https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/macgii/could_this_be_a_trigger/,t2_316ziccu,2021-03-22 10:16:20,1,1
