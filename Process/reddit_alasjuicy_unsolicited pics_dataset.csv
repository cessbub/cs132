"I don't care if you're a girl, unsolicited pics are unsolicited pics.","So like many of the people on this subreddit, I take nudes. 

I posted mine on r/phgonewild last week, nothing harmful. Some people messaged me about it, some wanting to hookup, the standard fare. Today though, something unusual happened.

I got a message request from a girl. In that message contained a compliment for my picture, but also something else.... A pussy pic. 

Usually, when a guy receives that, it feels titillating. However, this was my first time to receive one without asking for it. That felt so.... annoying. Yes, I'm a horny fucker. I like hooking up. I do ask for pics from women (consensually). If you send me something that I didn't ask for though? Ugh.

I don't care if I'm horny, if I didn't ask for it, I'm not asking for it. Do NOT send someone anything without consent, male, female, NB, or anything else.",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/1086ojx/i_dont_care_if_youre_a_girl_unsolicited_pics_are/,t2_uzp1eor9,2023-01-10 18:35:34,127
Unsolicited Dick Pics Enjoyer,"Bago lang ako naging active dito sa AJ. Mostly kasi sa CasualPH at sa AdultingPH lang ako nakatambay.

Pero nung nagcomment ako sa isang post dito about having my DMs open for dick pics... there are guys na nag-dm sa akin and feeling ko may na-unlock ako sa sarili ko tonight.

Sobra akong nahorny. Haha!

Ang sarap sa feeling na binabastos ako with unsolicited dick pics. ü•µ

Feeling ko this is my alter ego kasi parang ang weird pakinggan na open ka sa unsolicited dick pics 'di ba? Hahaha.

Pero ayun, if may gustong mag-send... 'wag na magpaalam. Mas nahohorny ako kapag walang consent. Oops!

UNSOLICITED DICK PIC,"Hello men of aj!

Eto sakin lang ah. Para sakin lang. Point of view ko. Opinion ko. 

Hindi porke sex pinag uusapan nyo at naghuhubadan na kayo sa chat eh entitled na kayo mag send ng tite. And hindi porke ang previous post ng OP ay naghahanap ng fubu, ay gugulantangin nyo ng mga tite nyo.

Utang na loob. GAANO BA KAHIRAP HUMINGI NG CONSENT?! Tapos ibabato samin ""binigyan naman kita ng heads up"" PUMAYAG BA????

Ako kasi ayoko ng sinesendan ng tite talaga. Nababastos ako. Feeling ko minamaliit ako. Para sakin ah. Yun ung feeling ko. Kung iyayabang mo sakin yan, sa personal mo ipakita. O i-describe mo.

Anong meron sa unsolicited pics?,"Hello there! So curious lang ako sa sagot niyo as a person who sent pics and a person who received pics specially the unsolicited dck pics. 

What do you usually do with those pics na bigla bigla nalang sinesend sa inyo? Like anong reaction niyo when you received that?

Why do you guys send unsolicited dck pics out of nowhere, like anong reason niyo bat kayo bigla biglang nagsesend ng ganun? And anong gusto niyo reaction ng mga girls pag nakakareceive sila ng mga sinesend niyo?

unsolicited poging dck pics,"good afternoon aj peeps! your 20 y/o girl is back. a week ago, i was scrolling through this app and i made a decision na iopen yung mga message requests. I opened some of it esp. mga recent messages before pero there are messages left pa na stucked na from months. I didn't expect to receive lots of unsolicited d pics haha. Im not really sure if i'll call it unsolicited kasi i loved to receive d pics ever since this pandemic happened and masturbated over it. At some point, naging coping mechanism ko 'yon, as well as maging horny if stress, watch guys thru call and such horny things. 

all i can say to these d pics ay mayroon talagang poging tite haha. Dont get me wrong ah  HAHAHAHA. Pogi etits for me is right size, girth and color. Yung by looking at it makes me really horny na haha. Additionally, ang sasarap niyo hahaha. mahapdi kayo sa ekup pag nagkataon HAHAHAHA nginig malala talaga. ayon lang thanks!!

Whatchu think of unsolicited dick pics?,"Is it just me or receiving unsolicited dick pics definitely ruins the mood in the midst of sexting? Once or twice is enough to spice things up. More than that is very meh. 

From some guys‚Äô perspective though, they don‚Äôt mind receiving hundreds of unsolicited noods from women since they‚Äôre known as ‚Äòvisual‚Äô creatures. But why is it the other way around for some women? 

How do you explain to your partner that it ruins your ‚Äòmood‚Äô without ruining his high sexual drive?",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/196doj4/whatchu_think_of_unsolicited_dick_pics/,t2_6716ujqc,2024-01-14 19:15:29,9

People fail to realize that the tool you have is not enough to impress someone lalo na performance over matter kasi ang labanan na ngayon, lapagan mo ng CV ganon hahahaha jk.

For people na nagsesend right away ng nude pics, bakit? I‚Äôm really curious why do you think it‚Äôs a good way to get the attention of somebody.",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/16rh1yf/di_ko_talaga_gets_yung_pagsesend_ng_unsolicited/,t2_pnxy1sh0,2023-09-25 11:18:15,8
To guys who love sending unsolicited dick pics,"This doesn't apply to all guys, I'm not generalizing. Just to some. Kapag natamaan ilag nalang.   
This happened to me a lot and most of my girl friends and as we discuss it, bakit nga ba? 

&#x200B;

Bakit ba gigil na gigil yung ibang mga lalaki na mag send ng dick pics? I mean, start pa lang ng conversation mag tatanong agad *""Gusto mo makita titi ko""* or yung iba, hindi pa nga nag hi or hello, boom. Dick pic agad. May kasama pang tanong, *""malaki ba?*"".  


Coming from a female's perspective, ang tanong ko lang, ano bang expect niyo na reaction namin? 

*""Ang laki naman, ang sarap""*   
*""Wow""*  
*""Thank you, kailangang kailangan ko yan ngayon, nakaka inspire naman""*  


If those words are what you expected, madi-disappoint lang kayo.   


I understand naman na may girls talaga na gusto makipag exchange ng nudes, pero yung out of nowhere mag tatanong ng ganun or magsesend ng dick pic. I don't know what you guys expect girls to react. Tapos kapag hindi pinansin, or iniba ang topic, kala mo mga pa-sad boy.   


I'm just really sick of guys na proud na proud sa titi nila eh hindi naman lahat ng girls attracted sa itsura nun in the first place, paano pa kaya sa titi ng strangers na hindi naman namin kilala.  One minute the conversation was just about asking how your day was, the next, may pa surprise na. Yung iba pang dick pics, susme, OA sa pag ka zoom in.   


For ego boost? Para ba maka pang akit? Magyaya ng sex? 

Eh sa totoo lang nakaka turn off kaya yun, unless girls na mismo ang mag ask, go, pero kung SFW ang usap, or start pa lang ng convo magse-send agad tapos ang caption *""Gusto mo? Malaki to""*.  

We can just block people like that, I know. Pero nakaka sawa lang paulit ulit na hindi magets ng ibang guys na most girls don't like unsolicited dick pics. Some don't even want dick pics at all.   


Kung nakikita lang nila yung facial reaction naming mga girls pag nakakakita ng unwanted dick pics baka yung ego nila to the floor na.   


Anyway yun lang. I know girls send unsolicited nudes too but my point is guys because this is coming from my experiences and point of view. 

To those guys: 

Ask before you send your nudes. If it's okay, go. If not, don't push it.   
In the end, hindi yan maa-appreciate kapag pinilit. Baka automatic block or worse, baka malait ka pa in your face. Tapos topic ka na sa GC ng barkada.",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/ygwylu/to_guys_who_love_sending_unsolicited_dick_pics/,t2_tsuqumra,2022-10-30 06:30:29,39
Goodbye doktora 2.0,"Hello. Since marami akong nakuhang message regarding to what exactly happened with u/drromanthicc and why she deleted her account. Here are some of the reasons:

1. Since she‚Äôs bi, ‚Äúgirls‚Äù are sending her nudes, some unsolicited and some are not, which is honestly very welcome naman talaga sa kanya. However, there are multiple instances na yung mga ‚Äúgirls‚Äù pala na yun are guys pretending to be a girl. Kunwari nagsesend ng nudes nila to share or to rate yun pala they are just trying to convince dra to send one back.

2. Guys pretending to be girls na nakikipagchat or kinakaibihan siya. Tapos magsesend ng selfie kunwari nila sabay hirit na ‚Äúsis, send ka din ng face pic mo‚Äù.

3. Unsolicited dick pics na napakarami. 

4. Maraming kupal and bastos na lalaki kapag di napagbibigyan or pinapansin. 

5. Random people trying to doxx her. Scary to think that people can almost identify your real identity just based on description.  Some are even blackmailing her into sending them nudes kung hindi ikakalat nila sa mga kakilala.

I love getting social media attention from guys,"Yes, tama pagkakabasa ninyo sa title. I love getting male attention and validation.

So i have this Tiktok account where i post thirst trap for fun when i am feeling myself. I like to film myself while wearing some seductice/risque clothing and somehow i enjoy it especially kapag nakaka receive ako ng feedback from guys. Yung mga comments na sinasabi nila kung gaano daw kaganda yung katawan ko especially my ass and thighs lol, hanggang sa umabot nga ng 10k followers yung tiktok account ko from posting thirst traps.

These past weeks I've been getting a lot of messages from my social media accounts na naka link sa tiktok ko especially sa IG and most of them are really dirty and perverted messages, unsolicited dick pics and also some couple of indecent proposals from them.

I like this setup yung tipong hanggang pantasya lang sila sa akin :P gusto ko man sila i-entertain lahat pero hindi ko talaga magawa kasi sobrang daming messages talaga ang narereceive ko araw araw. Siguro pag umabot ng 100k followers yung tiktok account ko baka mag drop nalang ako sa school at gumawa nalang ng ONLYFANS account HAHAHAHHAHA JK.",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/11se41j/i_love_getting_social_media_attention_from_guys/,t2_w3uc20nw,2023-03-16 08:11:11,173
no means no,"When I made this new Reddit account, I wondered how long it would take for someone to send me an unsolicited dick pic. Five days, people. I did not even express any need for sex during the last five days.

I clearly said no, yet this guy flooded my chatbox with his junk asking for a dickrate. I kindly (and later on, bluntly) asked him to stop and find someone else who is interested, while educating him to ask consent first (I don't want to block and report him right away ‚Äî I want to try educating him first kasi baka may ibang girls pa siyang maharass after me). Idk if his brain crawled its way down to his dick because he clearly ignored me and kept on showing his post-deed dick.

Showing off your thing will not make me horny. Actually, doing it without my permission is a big turn off kahit pa grabe ang pent-up lust ko or kahit ideal junk pa pinapakita mo. Yes, I'm openminded and my libido is beyond average, pero I'm not that desperate to entertain some random guy just because I've seen his dick. There's a reason why I've been enduring this unbearable dry spell for three years and only had one partner before that. I am not interested in casual hookups or online R18+ landian. Nandito ako sa Reddit para tumambay, magbasa, magkwento at makipag-usap kapag feel ko ‚Äî not to find someone to hook up with. And I'm sure there are girls out there who are just like me.

Many girls have already complained about this issue so many times. Yet, there are still some guys who can't comprehend a simple no. Why don't some people get it? Sending unsolicited dick pic is not a shortcut to someone else's pants. It's just plain harassment and disrespect especially when the other party directly said no.

CONSENT IS IMPORTANT. NO MEANS NO. Openly talking about sexual stuff is definitely not a sexual innuendo or invitation.

Wag niyo ipagpilitan sarili niyo sa taong ayaw sa inyo. Hindi niyo ikakagwapo yan.",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/vtwu1w/no_means_no/,t2_pivwm4hi,2022-07-08 08:00:34,206

"Like Mother, Like Daughter","Hii Guys! Quick Story time lang hahaha medj  matagal na to and want ko lang ikwento here. So dati kasi ako lang may cellphone dito sa amin kasi mahal pa naman cellphone dati. Dahil ako lang may cellphone noon minsan nakikionline si mama sa akin kasi magbabasa siya ng mga messages niya sa facebook, nakakausap niya mga classmates niya nung high school and relatives namin sa province. So ito nga, diba sa messenger may message request don. Binuksan ko out of curiosity ang message requests niya kasi may mga messages and nagulat ako sa nakita kong mga messages sa kanya. Sa pagkakatanda ko, hindi niya pa naoopen mga yon kasi di siya techy para kalukutin ang mga messages plus nakabold pa ang letters so meaning unread pa siya at ako una makakakita. Upon opening the conversations, napansin ko parang mga afam halos lahat ng name ng nagmemessage sa kanya. When I opened each conversations bumungad sa akin ang mga Unsolicited Dick Pics nila which was sent to my mom. Ang lalaki pala talaga ng ari ng nga afam no? hahaha. Pero after non dinelete ko mga messages para di na niya makita.

1. **the ""straight to the point dtf?"" guy** - wala ng intro-intro, just dead center on their goal. good thing is transparent kausap and they're not here to waste time lol


2. **the ""friendly/nice"" guy** - casual talks with momentary harutan but i didn't realize we've been talking for months on end. we're basically besties ngl 


3. **the ""slr"" guy** - he's so nice to talk to pero hindi kayo nagtatagpo for some reason. it's either 2 mins apart or 2-3 business days, there is no in between.


4. **the ""overlyprotective may kausap ka pang iba?"" guy** - we've only been talking for awhile but he's so clingy and protective about anything and everything. asking who's the guy on my DMs and comments lol


5. **the ""dick pic"" guy** - constantly sends unsolicited dick pics along with their unsolicited advice on how I should act as woman


6. **the ""started off strong but it turns out you're a douchebag""** - our conversation felt promising and we're heading onto the right direction but you kept bugging me about stupid questions only to end up mansplaining it all


7. **the ""tito from foreign country"" guy** - i've encountered this lots of times na they want us to stay constants until they go home sa Philippines and that's for X (sometimes indefinite) amount of time.


8. **the ""hand pic"" guy - best guy. no words!**

From a girl to a girl: Do you like creampies?,"Because that's me. I'm THAT girl.   


*To be fair and perfectly leveled with you all (especially the creeps who sends me unsolicited dick pics on the daily), I'm NOT addicted to sex or to the kink. I'm a pretty strict gal when it comes to those I've been blessed to receive their sperm and I make sure that everyone is safe and clean.*

But, that being said...

Condoms just don't cut it for me. Never been a fan of hot latex going in and out of my vagina. I need that raw, throbbing skin pummeling against my insides. Veiny dicks are a plus, too! It makes me feel the pulses when I'm being loaded with lots of hot cum. 

And I like all the types too, the thick and slimy all the way down to the dripping mess when there's too much to handle. I'm a fairly smol girl so I like my raw dicks on the average spectrum, just enough to stretch my labias and make me feel his angry cock wanting to breed me.

This one's for the boys,"I have talked with several women here on reddit and I have heard the same complaints about men both here on reddit, dating apps, and even Omegle, and that is - ""men rush"".

I think women of AJ can back me up on this but, there's no built-in ""on and off"" button for women's libido. You don't just whip your tool and she'd automatically drool over us. By doing so, would only reflect on our character rather than our sexual prowess.

I feel sad that few men appreciates the art of conversation nowadays and just want to go straight to the point. That rarely work. The dance of HU, FWB, ONS, and even finding a potential partner requires patience, empathy, sensitivity, and most of all, humanity. You don't whip your tool out on a bar just to woo the ladies, you don't jump the gun when you appraoch a lady, why would virtual interaction be different?

Listen, understand, respect, class... I think women dig men with manners and humor more than men with long tools and Adonis like physique. Unsolicited dick pics rarely get you laid. Jumping the guns in just a few conversation will only tend to push the girl away as your intention is clear. 

I know we have atrong libidos, let's not try to look desperate just to satisfy our urges. You're afraid of their impression? Be yourself. If they can't accept that or you're not their type, respect the decision, thank them for theie time, and move on to the next one. Afraid of sounding dull or boring? Read more, learn more, there's so many things under the sun to talk about... why limit your discussion to sex? You just want release your libido without all these jazz? Why not consider paying for one or watching p*rn and pop one off?

Remember sex without substance is just jerking off with a partner. Sex is meant to be enjoyed, it's means to be appreciated, it's meant to be an adventure and discovery... it should never be vanilla or one sided. It should never be shallow. It's too good for that.

Also, please stay away from minors. I've seen and heard some men dig teenagers. Remember 18 is a gray area... under that and you're definitely looking for trouble and this should be a warning for any man reading this and is thinking of fulfilling their Loli fantasies. Once we found out, I'll definitely hunt you down and bring you to justice (and I know the gentlemen of AJ are with me in this witch hunt).

It's time boys become men, and men become gentlemen. Keep it classy guys!

    1. Di ka marunong magbasa. Kulang ka sa comprehension. 
-posted one time sa isang sub na maglagay ng isang word which I included sa post kung talagang nabasa nga nang buo post ko. Sa estimate ko, 80% ng nag-dm sa akin ay HINDI NAGBASA. Makakita lang ng F4M post birada na agad. 
-pag ang hanap ay constant kausap, constant dapat. Pag ang hanap ay conversationalist, madaldap dapat dahil malamang sa malamang yung kausap mo e introvert. 

    2. Isa kang sadboi
-paawa effect para makakantot. Yung tipong 2years na daw last sex nya kaya nagpapaawa na need na daw nya makakantot. Pwe. 

    3. Unsolicited nsfw pics
-hindi porke G sa nsfw topics ang girls ay lagi mo na sya sesendan ng nsfw pics. One time, pinadalhan ako ng stolen pic ng girl workmate nya na nakaupo at kita na guhit ng pwet dahil low waist pants nya. MATIC TURN OFF. 

    4. Feeling jowa ka
-matic turn off agad sakin pag d ako agad nakareply then sasabihan ako na ""ay busy na?"" ""anong ginagawa mo kanina bat di ka nagrereply?"" etc. May buhay din po ako at nagiging abala minsan. At wala ka na don kung ano man ginawa ko üôÉ

    5. Masyado Kang nagmamadali
-bes, alam kong kantot na kantot ka na pero wag ka naman pahalata masyado na gusto mo na maka-iyot. We also need to know the person bago I-meet. 

    6. Hindi ka masarap ka-sex
-Para to sa mga failed meetups. Yung sobrang galing mo sa chat tapos sa sa actual di mo man lang Napa-cum si girl?? Then mag-aask ng exclusivity? HELL NO.

    7. Di marunong tumupad sa usapan/ dos and donts
-lalo na kung condom is a must. Tapos pupunta ka sa motel ng walang condom?  Pakyu. 

    8. Hindi kayo match ng vibes
-yes, tanggapin na natin na di lahat makaka-vibes natin kahit sa sex. Kaya much better na stop na habang maaga pa. 

Again, lahat to based lang sa experiences ko. I'm not speaking on behalf of girls na nandito.

A regular sized hotdog?,"
I woke up at around 9 in the morning and my mother told me to have my breakfast already. Kami dalawa ng kapatid ko ginising nya kasi kami nalang dalawa hindi pa nakakain. Hotdogs pala na chicken flavor and regular size yung ulam namin and may beef patties. 

I don't know what the hell happened to me but a hook up partner of mine crossed my mind. It's actually been almost a year since we had our encounter and naalala ko siya dahil sa ulam namin. Don't get me wrong but mas malaki pa yung regular sized hotdog kesa sa d!ck nya üò≠ 

Istg, uwing uwi ako nung time na yon üò≠ I was having a second thought if isuck ko ba or nah but yeah, I sucked him haha expecting that it'll grow bigger but damn, hindi talaga üò≠ that's like one of the worsts encounter I've ever had. Kinda offending on my part. 

He's actually 5'10. You can't blame me for anticipating for a bigger like girthy dick diba? 

Ganun ba talaga kapag matangkad na or? HAHAHA I'm not shaming anyone guys, I just wanna know. I'm a very open person. Medj di ko lang yun nagustuhan kasi he's bragging naman kasi sa chat na ganto ganyan. Well, na disappoint ako sa kanya that time honestly.

Natatawa nalang ako now na naccringe sa encounter na yun üòÜ hopefully it won't ever happen again. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/194pfta/a_regular_sized_hotdog/,t2_qgv8wnbyi,2024-01-12 15:36:26,6
Erection Pole Watchers,"Just a curious question for the ladies, trans, bis, and etc..

Now that r/phladyboners is gone, where do you get your daily dose of poles to watch? And do you really enjoy seeing poles as much as men love seeing tits and holes? Why do men enjoy unsolicited tit pics while opposite sa other gender? What qualities does a pole need to have to be labeled as pleasing to look at?

Am I normal? Am I unappreciative? or is something wrong with me?,"Hi everyone, I'm curious! Hope you can help me understand myself?

If you'll take a look on my profile you'll see that I've started sharing my nudes online (here on reddit) and all of them have very ""NSFW-esque"" captions (even going beyond the borders of what we or I can consider ""normal"").

I do this postings because I love delving in my sexual fantasies. It gives me a sense or form of validation, feeling of being wanted or appreciated, and feelings of happiness making someone's dick go up. When it comes to my fantasies, it often revolves around the idea of me, being very submissive to my partner. While my partner is able to provide me with everything and he never did lack on these things,(validation, wantedness, appreciation, etc.) and while I get fucked really good every week and get my fantasies of submission come true to life coz he's a really good dom, I sometimes find myself STILL fantasizing about gangbangs, being throated or double penetrated by another guy(s), etc ‚Äì there is still this weird feeling that I still want to share myself to other guys so that they can also degrade me, tell me how much they want me or want to fuck me, etc. Whenever I get this feeling, I'll just take a a nude, send it to my partner and sometimes just post it here on Reddit so that guys can slid to my DM's and tell me how they want to fuck me, how much they'd like to fuck me and such (and the list goes on). AND THIS, from the comments I have received so far on my nude posts, all of it, the offensive and the unsolicited dick pics, all of them turns me on and at times, makes me wet.

With all of this going on I'm wondering, AM I EVEN NORMAL PA or AM I TOO HORNY NA? AM I UNAPPRECIATIVE OR WHAT?

Goodbye,"This Reddit account I‚Äôm using has been with me through the major ups and downs. I‚Äôve been to places that I didn‚Äôt know I could go to and experience things that I didn‚Äôt think I would. 

But lately, I‚Äôve been very down and depressed. Thank you for the people who joined me in this sexual journey, the people who lifted up my confidence, the people who jacked off to my photos, and the ones who sent me unsolicited dick pics.

Am I doing something wrong?,"so I have a bestfriend, known her since JHS and still really close today. Recently I‚Äôve started to see her in a more sexual way but I never act on it since she has made it clear back then that she could never see me as more than a friend, and I‚Äôm fine with that. Pero it‚Äôs just whenever I see her I act up a bit, for context, she‚Äôs 5 flat small tits and a round ass, not really my type but there‚Äôs something about her that just makes me feel horny. So now when she sends me selfies and stuff for my thoughts I tend to masturbate to them and then regret it very soon. Is what I‚Äôm doing wrong and should I stop it?",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/upns9b/am_i_doing_something_wrong/,t2_8k29q57w,2022-05-15 02:53:53,2
"Boyfriend keeps on posting thirst traps. As a girlfriend, am i being too unreasonable for being uncomfy and annoyed?","Hi guys! Apologies if I ask this kind of question here but I seriously need insights. This has been bugging me for the longest time already.

My boyfriend and I have been together for 3 years already. Between the two of us, siya talaga yung mas outgoing and social media person. Recently, he started posting topless pics on his soc med accounts and at first, no malice naman. I was just letting him do his own thing: your body your choice, let‚Äôs celebrate these bodies kind of thinking. I don‚Äôt really mind at first pero these past few weeks, I get uncomfy when I view his socmed accounts and see unsolicited comments from other guys/bis in the internet. Most of his followers are gays/bisexuals and I get uncomfy about this to the point na I actually questioned his sexuality. As a gf, I feel disrespected pero ayoko naman din maging over controlling and manipulative type of gf. 

I tried to tell him about this and he told me na wag nalang daw pansinin and he‚Äôs just cool receiving those comments. Hanggang tingin lang naman daw sila and he doesn‚Äôt respond naman to those comments. So di ba how can I be offended if okay lang naman pala for him? But I know deep down, I‚Äôm getting annoyed and frustrated about this. 

He told me na it‚Äôs just his way seeking for validation, expressing himself etc. External validation can be helpful sometimes but idk. He told me he‚Äôll stop posting videos but at the same time, I feel guilty since I don‚Äôt want to be the manipulative, jealous girlfriend. I don‚Äôt want to stop or put an end to his ‚Äòoutlet‚Äô.

How can we solve this? Am I being too controlling? Do I need to be more open minded and accept na ganon talaga trip nya? But at the same time, how about my feelings? Aren‚Äôt my feelings valid din at the same time? I just want to solve this like a mature adult couple but clearly there‚Äôs a friction on how we view things. How can we come up with a compromised setup? Can this still be solved or this just shows that maybe we‚Äôre not actually that compatible??? If you‚Äôre in my position, what would you do???????",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/li4pfr/boyfriend_keeps_on_posting_thirst_traps_as_a/,t2_82et0b99,2021-02-12 13:38:48,13
A Beginner's Guide for Guys on How to Score on r/phr4r,"\[Edit1: Added some tips given by a commenter below!\]

\[Edit2: Newly discovered tip delivered to you fresh from the oven! Okay, so far this post has been up for 18 hours and I've already got 3 indecent proposals from girls in my chat - one even outright sent me her nudes! Didn't reach a meetup agreement with any of them though (so far lol) but I'm amazed at how this post which wasn't at all intended to fish for hookups is making me look pretty good right now. From what I observe, the girls who messaged liked my vibe and imagined that they would get along with me. So tip is if you're not getting anywhere on r4r, try posting a piece about whatever on whichever sub but make the reader know about what kind of personality you have through your stories/words while also giving subtle hints that you're down to get a bit freaky. If they enjoy what they read, they might message you to get to know you more! P.S. What an absolutely wonderful start to a day this is! Haha\]

I'll preface this by stating that I'm surely not the most qualified to write this as there are probably savvier guys who could do a lot better than me, but I'd still like to share the things I learned and how I've improved my r4r game and how maybe you can too.

Why am I sharing when I could keep this all to myself? Ewan, bored at work? Throwaway account karma? Tbh a big reason is sometimes I get so frustrated with our gender whenever I read stories on here about how fucking creepy some of my fellow men have been acting to the point that they've pushed a number of girls away from r4r because of rude and unsatisfying encounters. So ladies, this one's also for you. Iniisip ko rin na if there are higher quality men on that sub, the more likely women are going to recommend it to all their other friends, so here goes..

\[For context, I am your average looking, average height, average BMI, stable job but not rich, lives with my siblings but I have my own car, big 4 grad (eww, ikr??), and generally just a ""good vibes only"" type of person with no major problems or red flags that I'm aware of. I have hooked up with 7 different girls from r4r since I started last March - 2 were multiple encounters and 5 were one night stands and to my understanding, this is already a very successful count especially given the fact na medyo choosy pa ko when it comes to physical appearances. For further context, I'd say I've swapped pics with about 30 or so redditors. Among them, 7 lang yung we were both game, 10 who only I sent a pic but they passed so I didn't bother asking for theirs, another 10 yung they were g for me but I passed after they sent their pic, and siguro another 5 yung we both exchanged pics but we both passed on each other. - all estimated numbers of course but thereabouts.\]

**1. If all you've been doing is constantly messaging the girls whose posts you see on your reddit homepage with already a hundred upvotes and posted more than hours ago, you're in for some hard work and you're basically playing the lottery at that point.**

Those posts you see have already probably received at least a hundred messages and they will most likely not respond to you anymore even if you think you've come up with an eye-catching message. As a social experiment, I made a throwaway just to post as a female wherein all I said was I'm looking to have drinks with someone tonight, not even specifically NSFW. 134 fucking replies in less than 1 hour. Putangina hahaha. I didn't reply to anyone cos I'm already testing my moral compass with this experiment, but I did read through a couple of them and unfortunately majority are just plain sad with how lazy the replies are - ""Hi I'm g"" / ""27M QC here"" / ""tara inom mamaya san tayo"". Hay... More on this later.

6 out of the 7 girls I've hooked up with have been through them replying to my posts. And I have tried messaging them on their posts but now I only do when I've been browsing under the ""New"" section and the post is less than 5 minutes old (anything longer and I already assume I'm the 100th guy to message and thus won't ever be seen). Your best bet would still be by posting an ad yourself!

Side note and rant for the guys: Why are you people upvoting all the F4M posts?? Kung gusto mo mas konti kalaban mo sa nahanap mong post, edi wag mo iupvote para hindi lumabas sa feed ng lahat ng lalaki!

**2. Learn how to stand out from the sea of M4Fs.**

Try having a scroll through r4r and see how many posts titled ""Looking for constant fubu"" or ""let's have some fun tonight"" there are. Sa tingin mo mapapansin yan ng maraming babae? Use your beautiful mind and get those creative juices flowing with a witty or even flaunty title that's exponentially more likely to pique a girl's curiosity. If you've got the resources that you think most girls would be thirsty over (i.e. a desirable job \[doctor, lawyer, etc\], a jacked up body with abs, a BGC/Rockwell condo), go put that shit in title! Anything creative and unique is guaranteed to get more clicks than just another generic title, no matter how gwapo you are or how big you think your dick is.

This also applies to when you're messaging girls who post. Be concise yet substantial and engaging. Unsolicited dick pics are almost always not appreciated, and for crying out loud kung tagged as SFW yung post ng babae, wag ka na mag pursiging magtanong kung may chance bang pwedeng NSFW. Fucking cringe. \[Edit1: And also, pag alam mong hindi ka pasok sa preference, wag nang makipagtawaran. Ano to, Divisoria? Pag sinabi nang 30+ only, wag na magtanong kung pwede ba 25. Kung sinabi nang Metro Manila only, wag ka na mag message if you're from Cebu!\]

**3. Be fucking confident in your tone!**

Okay, this one I'm not 100% sure cos I've never posted anything similar, but I really believe no girls would respond to hookup posts wherein guys say pabebe shit like ""I'm inexperienced so I hope you can teach me more about this stuff"" or ""we can be friends or we can also be fubus if you want"". Be confident and direct with what you want. State your concrete plan on how you'd like to go about the meetup, like example you want to have drinks at this bar first to set the mood first or some shit. If you're a noob at sex, you don't have to state it. Just be your confident self and tsaka mo na problemahin sa kama kung hindi mo na alam gagawin mo. At least may chance na after that night, experienced ka na ;)

**4. Re-post at different times!**

Almost don't wanna put this here since it's technically mej spamming, but no matter how well-written you believe your M4F post is, it's really only good for an hour or two. After that, it's gonna be buried under all the new ones that come after each minute and never to be seen again. If you didn't get any luck with your post, copy what you wrote, delete it, then post again. To keep it at least a little bit classy, I re-post at least 4 hours after and only really only re-use what I wrote about 3 times till I have to write another one for a different day. Ika nga, more entries, more chances of winning!

**5. If you're going to post or message, it's best to use a throwaway account.**

Unless your profile only consists of posts or comments you've made in the past which you think adds to your unique selling proposition, please just use a throwaway especially if your account contains engagement with NSFW subs. Girls would go through your profile before messaging you and one little comment 4 years ago is all it takes for them to second-guess their intention of chatting you. Best to just be a mystery and adjust your play accordingly with the woman you're messaging.

(Bonus tip which would probably get this post downvoted: if you're from Big 4, sorry but you're gonna have to state that fact in your About Me. Yung style ngayon is you put ""if it matters"" right next to it para di ka masyado madownvote LOL. You don't need to put that in your preferences or About You na you're looking for Big4 also if you're not particular naman about it. But the sad truth is, 4 of the 7 of my hookups are from the Big 4 and I'm quite sure they're the type na wouldn't have messaged me if I didn't state na I was from Big 4. Pero please, if hindi ka galing dun, wag ka magsinungaling. Unang convo mo pa lang sa babaeng Big 4, malalaman na kagad niya na you ""be cappin' fr ngl tho"")

That's all I could think of for now. Fellow men, feel free to share if you have any more tips. For women who've made it this far, let me know the accuracy of the points I've shared!",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/x33s5d/a_beginners_guide_for_guys_on_how_to_score_on/,t2_s2dtc6jo,2022-09-01 18:12:18,153
Pervert Commuter's Diary Pt. 1,"Malibog akong tao, btw I'm a guy on my late 20's. I think bata pa lang medyo bastos na talaga takbo ng utak ko. Nung 6 y/o pa lang ako nanghihipo na ako ng legs or pwet ng mga dumadaan sa tapat namin pero ang napanood ko lang na sex is yung sa mga aso sa tapat namin.  
  
I grew up sa conservative na family and church pastor yung tito ko so laking church din ako, naging church musician so naayos yung moral compass ko kahit papaano and it helped me suppress my libog. Pero nasa loob parin yung kulo ko.  
  
I love commuting, actually I do have a car pero I still choose to commute going to work. Di lang dahil makakapahinga ka habang nasa byahe, or makakatipid ka, I love it kasi nalalabas ko kabastusan ko sa katawan. Eto na nga, I love groping, actually common to sa japan, they call it ""Chikan"" and did a lot of porn with this concept (I never loved watching them tbh).   
  
What I do is dinidikit ko tite ko sa ass or sides ng mga babae during siksikan, either sa Bus, minibus, train, etc. Yes, for sure may mag sasabi na harassment yan or etc., I know it very well. You see, malilibog din yung mga babae and di naman sa bragging ako, pero I have the looks din. I can't even count how many encounters I had while commuting na nag rereciprocate din yung girl and I THINK they were asking for more.  
  
For me, the best feeling is sakto yung height namin (me being slightly tall, I'm a bit taller than average filipino height btw), and the girl have this juicy ass and she wears a light trouser. Damn, the feeling na nakalapat yung tite mo sa gitna ng ass ni girl and the fact na stanger kayo sa isat-isa and madaming pwedeng makakita, best feeling for me, it feels like you're melting, tbh mas masarap pa siya pag nilalabasan ako. I specially love the trending sort of korean trouser that girls love to wear these days, and the leggings as well kasi mas makikita mo pag pinagpala sa cake si girl.   
  
I also love corporate cuties/milfs na naka slacks tapos kitang kita mo curve ng ass nila, as you can tell, I'm an ass guy. They are the one whose also always reciprocate. I love doing this so much, I would even pay someone to it with me.  
  
After having said that, I'd love to share one of my memorable encounters. I do 2 rides just to get home, one train then one bus. If I'm not satisfied with my journey and kahit malapit na ako sa bahay, sasakay parin ako opposite pauwi, yung alam kong maraming sumasakay. This is the case to the one I'll be sharing.  
  
Pag baba ko ng bus and malapit na sa bahay, not feeling satisfied feels like na kulang yung araw ko. So I decided na mag extra trip and saw one minibus na usually napupuno, pag sakay ko palang, tayu-an na pero hindi pa siksikan. I had sight-on dito sa milf with glasses na nakasandal sa vertical railings. Hindi punuan pero comfortable for me enough to do my thing.   
  
So eto na nga, unti unti akong dumikit kay ate then nung mejo bumilis yung takbo namin, dinikit ko na nga. Inayos ko pa yung etits ko, kasi nung tumigas, naka curve down. I think she good with it naman, she actually looked at me for a moment and looked down sa kung ano mang nakatutok sa ass nya. Then she just continued looking at her phone, that's for me is a sign na goods tayo. Looking back, I'm not sure if she enjoyed it. Sometimes kasi I would know if the girl enjoyed it. There's one time na hinahagod pa ng girl using her ass yung length ng tite ko.   
  
Then, biglang napuno yung minibus and I had to reposition away from her kasi pinapausog ng konduktor to have more space for other passengers. Then may pumwesto in-between us ni ate so no chance na kami to continue, tapos wala din girl sa other side ko na type ko.   
  
So go with it nalang ako kahit sayang na pamasahe ko, then when I'm deciding na bumaba na and umiwi nalang, my attention was caught by the two woman na nakaupo sa harap ko, they look decent, kind of wearing their office uniforms, they're both good looking, not slim enought for my taste din.   
Magkasama sila and looks like going home from work din. Then napansin ko yung isa (the one who looks younger and morena) looking at my crotch. Nakabakat pa pala yung tite ko na matigas parin. I caught her multiple times glancing at my cock while talking with her friend. That makes me very horny and my cock got harder din and it makes me did one of the most daring things I did in my commuting journey.   
  
Me standing up in front of her, I slid one of my legs in-between her legs up to her crotch. Shit, sobrang nakaka-kaba yung feeling pero nung pag tingin ko kay ate, nag katinginan kami and she's a bit suprised pero no negative reaction from her naman and she just continued talking with her friend. Looks like goods kami ni ate.   
  
So sa libog ko, diniin ko pa gently yung tuhod ko sa loob ng hita nya. I even tried move her legs side to side na parang binubuka ko na yung hita nya, no resistance or whatever, she even let me buka her legs a bit para mas madali ako maka penetrate. Damn the look on her face, kita mo na libog na rin si ate. Her cheeks are a bit rosy na. While doing this for a while then so I realized na, all that time na doing it with the milf with glasses, nanonood pala siya.   
  
Kaya pala yung tingin nya sa tite ko, iba. Habang binabaybay ng minibus yung daan, inuuntog ko ng inuuntog yung tuhod ko sa pepe ni ate. Sinasabayan ko yung roughness ng byahe sa pag tuhog kay ate. At this time, gusto ko nang ikama si ate, gusto ko sana kuhain number niya pero ever since, wala pa akong kinuhang number sa kahit sinong naging encounter ko.   
  
Meron isa, binigay sakin yung fb nya pero walang nangyari, tho I sent her an unsolicited dick pic hahaha. Meron naman isa, hiningi ko palang name, sabi nya ""May pamilya na ako"" haha. Anyways, umuwi na ako and feeling satisfied naman. Happy din si junior. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/177i71t/pervert_commuters_diary_pt_1/,t2_9vpskj0b0,2023-10-14 13:22:26,0
A Guide for Virgin Men: The 10 things I learned from Hooking up,"#Nutrobbers: What Does He Know? Does He Know Things?? Let's Find Out!


Hello there! 

^General ^Kenobi

First of all I am not a self-proclaimed sex guru or fuccboi, fact is, I'm still in the noob side of the chart. This post will serve as a guide from the things that I learned from my experiences. 

Ever since I started writing my stories here I had several guys asking me on what to do and how do I do it. The answer to both questions is... I still don't know. It was all luck I guess and a little bit sense of humour.

I was virgin for the majority of my life and that is nothing to be ashamed of. I had no one when I started out. I'm not saying I could be your Hitch (From the movie Hitch) or that disgusting piece of trash, PUA. No no no. This will only just give you an idea and everthing else will be up to you.

#1. Women don't owe you sex


This is the most important lesson that I could tell you. Being nice doesn't give you a free pass for sex. Oh no, Women are not Starbucks. You don't get let them stamp your ""Nice Guy Card"" from all the nice things that you did and when you get all the required stamps they'd sleep with you. No. They'd sleep with you if they want to. So it's all a matter of how interesting you can be or how funny you are.

Especially on R4Rs. Don't get mad if women doesn't want to sleep with you. They don't owe their puday to you.

#2. Wash your Putotoy


*A smelly cock*

*Doesn't get suckie-suck*

Please. Wash your putotoy. Wash it with soap and body wash. Apply lotion as well so it'll still be mabango after school or work. Even if you're not going to have sex still wash it make it a part of your routine.

#3. Shave your Pubes

Now, this may differ to a lot pf people but I still included it since most that I've been with wants it shaved. Unlike no. 2, just shave when you're expecting sex.

It's better to shave because it looks clean **big, and inviting**

It's like you're telling the girl

""Hey you can put your mouth in""

So do shave, unless you partner expressively said that she doesn't want you to.

So here's a tip. If yours is a jungle that can explored, trim it with a scissor. Be careful tho, you might cut your dick *haha* Hello sa mga growers and maliit putotoy diyan eto advantage natin. lol. But seriously tho, trim it first para easy shave. After trimming apply shaving cream, if none, body wash or shampoo will do. Do it slowly.

#4. Wear a Condom


Raw Sex is cool but safe from unwantedpregnancyorSTDs is cooler.

Even if your partner doesn't want you to (Provided that she's a stranger) still wear a condom. It's not about trust issues but prevention.

#5. WAG KA MUNANG MAG JAKOL


If you have a scheduled sexy time, don't jerk off. Hinay muna sa ""Hot Latina Sweet Ass"" sa search bar sa pornhub.

Because if you're a chronic masturbator chances are you won't cum or you'll get soft mid sex. Yes this happened to me several times now until a partner said that I should've not jerked off. I tried it and BOI! Not only did I cum and it felt really REALLY good.

#6. Do push-ups


This is a bit of hypocrisy since I myself don't do push-ups.

*But Nutrobbers, why should I do push ups?*

I hear you audience and here's why.

Imagine it's a Sunday night and you're doing the missionary position because it's the right thing to do on a Sunday but wait! Hol'up! Your arms are getting weaker as time goes on. They're starting to shake and you hear your partner ""Are you okay?"" and you said ""Of course I am because I am man!"" and then *snap* your arms failed you and you fell on your partner resulting to a headbutt.

This situation may or may not be from an experience.


But yeah, do push ups plus it'll lessen your manboobs as well. No more lamas for you.


#7. Don't be too Manyakis

Be a gentle manyakis. Don't be too eager. You might make things uncomfortable. 

Like one redditor said

>Can guys be a perfect blend of chill, respeto, and bastos

-Username omitted

Just take your time. If she's in the mood then she's in the mood.


#8. Unsolicited Dick Pics

*If you want love*

*Lower your expectations a lot*

*You might think your dick is a gift I promise it's not*

- Bo Burnham

Just fucking don't. They'll ask for it if they want it.


#9. Don't ask for Nudes randomly.

This is in connection with no. 7

Asking for nudes should be done organically. You don't say ""Snd nuds"" in the middle of the conversation. 

Also a tip for the women. If you're talking through TELEGRAM (the app and not literally the written correspondence). There's a feature called ""Self-Destructing Photo"" (also on video), so set your nudes on timer. This will make you feel safe. If the dude is a douche then you can file for case against him under RA 9995.

#10. It's better to talk first for days before hooking-up


I can't stress this enough.

This is for your safety.

By talking to them first you can determine as to whether or not they're real or not. There is a chance that they're catfishing you and will rob you...or worse...CUT YOUR PUTOTOY. Yes I have this irrational fear of putotoy cutting.

also if the girl is for real then this will make this easier and will make you guys comfortable with each other.



I can only tell as of the moment since I'm still learning as well. It's not the ten commandments so you can still do whatever the fuck you want.

Feel free to add some more (women as well. Give us tips). Let's help each other for a better experience.



**EDIT**

I received several messages from men and I am grateful, but please, don't ask me what ""techniques"" I use to pick up women. 


First, I don't have a technique. All hook ups I had are from good communication and connection. 


Second, I am not from PUA so don't treat me as a pick up artist.


Third, all are from phr4r. That's it. There's no secret kantutan subreddit. 



I can only give you tips on how to better communicate and the rest is up to you. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/aklpi2/a_guide_for_virgin_men_the_10_things_i_learned/,t2_2ajn0gm1,2019-01-28 17:00:46,138
A MalasJuicy Story,"Preface: Please excuse my writing coz It's been a really loooong while since I last wrote a short story. I used to keep a journal a few years back but I got caught up in major life changes that I started to write less and less. Like other people, I write to contemplate, to reflect, to try and understand myself. I haven't been able to do that, hence, this ""Alas!"" (not so juicy) story.

So, here goes...

On lazy days, I would idly switch between reading goosebumps-inducing gross stories on Reddit, and, swiping left/right on potential hookups on various dating apps/websites like Tinder and OKC. One day I realized that Tinder is saturated with mostly... boring and unoriginal fuckbois (some even have Barney Stinson quotes on their profile). I mean, I'm okay with men who enjoy casual sex but not ones who only want to pump and dump. Don't get me wrong, I'm not looking for my soulmate (if s/he does exist), I just want someone who wouldn't treat me like some piece of meat. Thus, I searched Reddit for alternatives to Tinder and... Voila! PHR4R.

A few dozen failed and succesful attempts later, my curiosity and hunger for this basic human need is still not satisfied. 

Due to a recent event I would rather not get into, I am determined (read: hell-bent) on finding the best lay of my life. 

And so I decided to create this throwaway account to post quite a lust-fuelled personal ad (which I already deleted) on r4r. It went along the lines of ""I'm looking for a guy who would fuck me into oblivion"". Well, you guessed it, the post was well-received. Some guys slid into my DMs with unsolicited dick pics (ugh), while others sent elaborate essays explaining why they're my best choice and of course, there are ones who were very confident in their ""great"" fucking skills. Yes, I know I'm not celebrity levels of hot but I know I'm fuckable enough to be choosy. LOL.

Fast forward to Day 5/6 of the search, still no one. I'm starting to lose hope. To be honest, I didn't even know what I was looking for. An interesting guy with a decent face, I guess. Then I got this message from a 1-day old reddit user. I should have recognized this as a red flag, but I didn't care to check his profile at the time. 

We started chatting on Telegram. He interested me with his equally laid-back and enthusiatic approach. That same day, he was trying to convince me to come to his place so we could finally have a ""good time"". He even asked me to remove the ""STILL LOOKING"" tag on my post and make an update announcing that I've already found the one who would fuck me into oblivion. He even said something like ""Haha wala kasi silang game, ako na makakauna sayo.""

In retrospect, we didn't really have that much in common. I'm already tired of filtering applications and just allowed myself to be reckless. We exchanged photos. He said he liked my eyes and he looked okay to me (he has a toned ass and biceps which I like). He lured me into his lair with more flattery (another red flag), some weed and Andok's roast chicken. He also told me I can stay over if we finished late (we're from opposite sides of the metro) so I brought clothes (stupid, I know).

We agreed to meet the following day. At 6 in the morning he messaged me confirming if I'm still pushing through. I assured him that I'm not backing out. I went on with my tasks, he checked up on me almost hourly. By the end of the day, I left the office and booked a ride to his place.

Upon my arrival, we made a detour to a sari-sari store to buy some alcohol (note that he informed me that he doesn't drink coz it's bad for his training). He got Tanduay Ice (I hate that shit), I got beer. We bought some cigarettes too. 

A few steps from the house he suddenly faced me and said (not verbatim) ""I haven't been completely honest with you, kaka-break ko lang, mga 1 week ago."" I was like ""Okay. So you didn't tell me coz you think I'd back out?"". I was genuinely fine with that, as long as he shows me a good time. He then mentioned ""you can leave after we finish, maage pa naman"". I was still okay with that even though he could've told me earlier so that I didn't have to bring my clothes.

When we entered the house he introduced me to the maid, then we sat in this dimly-lit living room. After we both smoked a few sticks and barely finished one bottle each, he handed me a box of condoms and asked if it's okay with me to have sex on the floor (third red flag I ignored). I was like ""WHAT?!? NO."" We settled the issue with him putting this single bed foam mattress inside his ""room"" (which is inside another room).

I could see that he was restless and just wanted to get it over with. So did I. I was feeling somewhat uncomfortable at this point and thought I was too far in to back out. I sipped some more beer then I said ""Okay, let's do it."" 

We were standing at the door to his ""room"" when he turned on the lights. Surprise! I quickly surveyed the room and here is what I saw: a dirty-looking sink, a moldy toilet and a shower cubicle the size of one telephone booth -- all out in the open. I thought to myself, ""Wait, is this a fucking bathroom?"" Well, yeah. Large enough to fit one mattress in the middle. I don't understand why I didn't run out the door right then and there. I guess I didn't give a shit anymore.

I said, ""lights off, please"". The sight of that room turns me off as much as seeing Duterte kissing that poor woman in South Korea. I used the flashlight on my phone so it's not too dark.

We laid on the bed. Foreplay, which was only around a minute, consists of: sloppy kissing, some boob grabbing, hasty undressing and 5 seconds of finger fucking. The actual intercourse was less than 10 minutes. He fucked me with his semi-boner in missionary position while his salty sweat dripped on my face. How titilating. 

After he nut, he had the nerve to say, ""to be honest dude that's not even a boner! I didn't get a full hard-on because of the alak."" I know, man. I know what a boner is. 

He left me in the ""room"" to clean up. When I got out, his friend (who owned the house) was there and they were already smoking weed. I said ""Hi"", sat on the couch, took a few hits and then texted a friend. No way am I staying over. 

While I waited for my friend's reply, I tried to talk to him about what happened. He just kept saying ""It's all good, man. No point in talking about it. What's done is done."" I actually agree, but get this: I came there hoping to be (or at least tried to be) fucked into oblivion. I walked in on his pity party instead.

I would have been more sympathetic towards him if he'd just come clean. He lied to me about a lot of things. Not having Andok's roast chicken for dinner was just the tip of the iceberg.

When I was about to leave, he offered me a box of mac 'n cheese I could take home as A TOKEN. I laughed and said ""No, thanks."" I bid my goodbyes and left.

Guys, if you ever plan on scoring some rebound sex a week after a break up, please be more considerate of other people. You're not the only one who goes through shit.

Badtrip, pare.

TL;DR: I hooked up with a broken-hearted boy, turns out his dick was broken too

The first time I sucked a dick.,"Disclaimer: Warning! This is a LONG READ. I tried to remember in detail what happened that time. This is the first time I'll be doing this so this contains a lot of grammatical errors. Sorry na agad!

A little back story:

I was raised in a strict family. I can't go to parties or clubs. I'm not allowed to go to sleepovers. I'm not allowed to leave the house at night except when I'm with my cousins. I'm not allowed to have a boyfriend while I'm still studying pa. I'm such a good girl at that time so I followed all the rules. But when I graduated College, they became less strict na. Pwede na mag party/club, sleepover, and out-of-town with friends. But not always and with limitations pa rin. Pwede na rin mag boyfriend but I grew awkward around guys. Maybe that's one of the reasons why I'm still NBSB at the age of 26. Syempre kahit NBSB ako, I still want to feel the feeling of having a boyfriend and also may sexual urges din ako. But I‚Äôm always at home kasi WFH ako so paano ako lumalandi? Lol! I downloaded dating apps. Hopeless romantic ako and ang goal talaga is to find potential jowa. 


2 years ago I matched with this guy on Bumble. Let's call him Tony. We moved immediately on FB and followed each other on Ig. I had the impression that he only wants casual fuck. So I told Tony I don't do casual and he shouldn't expect something will happen between us. And he said okay lang and wants to date/meet me and I said yes. He consistently asks me out but I always find a reason not to meet him even though I said Yes initially. I know sinabi ko na I'm using dating apps to find potential jowa but when the guys are asking me to meet them. I always chicken out, biglang ayaw ko na and I think it will be awkward. Usually, when I turned down a date 2-3 times from a guy, they stopped asking me for dates na. (Yes, It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me!) But Tony seemed different. He still asked me out even after ang dami kong reason sinabi para hindi matuloy date namin. So that's when I decided to meet him finally.

I decided to meet Tony after lunch. It was a rainy afternoon when he fetched me malapit sa bahay lang para hindi ako mahuli na nakikipagdate without my family knowing. Medyo traditional din kasi family ko, gusto nila ipakilala muna sa kanila which is ayaw ko. Gusto ako muna kumilala para malaman ko kung okay ba sya sa family ko bago ipakilala. 

FF:
I can feel that he's trying to make me comfortable with him by asking some questions. Sinabi ko sa kanya na alam ng mga friends ko na I‚Äôm meeting him kasi baka isako nya ko or ipasok sa maleta. Lol! He laughed it off and said it was fine. He‚Äôs a good guy and hindi nya daw gagawin yon. He's asking me some silly and naughty questions too, which I answered naman. While looking outside the window, he leaned to get something in his compartment. Tony then asked me if I saw something. I said no, what is it? He said it was a box of condoms. He's testing the water na pala. Btw, englishero pala si koya mo.

Tony asked me if I usually wear the same style of clothes I'm wearing at that time kapag lumalabas ako. (For reference: Naka-white crop-top and cardigan and plaid skort ako.) I said yes, he then asked if I received some stares from guys when wearing these kind of outfits. I said I don't know, I don't check guys if they are staring at me except sa mga truck and tricycle drivers na nag-catcall habang naghihintay ng jeep. I asked him why he asked me that question. He then said I have nice legs daw kasi. While we are stuck in the traffic, he asked for permission if he can touch my legs. I nodded yes. He touch my legs up and down and then grabbed it. He then grabbed my hand and looked me in the eye like he was asking for permission to touch his dick inside his shorts. And dang, I nervously nodded, I guess he got me with his cunning smile. Pero kinakabahan talaga ako. It was my first time touching a dick! Nakikita ko lang yan sa porn tsaka sa mga unsolicited dick pics na nare-receive ko. So I touch his dick and it feels so warm. Una parang malambot pa dick nya pero nararamdaman ko na tumitigas na. He then grabbed my hand inside his shorts like he was instructing me to do a hand job. But the cars in front of us started moving that's why I removed my hand from his shorts. Once we got out of the traffic, we decided to grab some drinks at the DD‚Äôs drive-thru muna.

We then went to a coffee shop but we already have a drink na. So we decided to just stay in the parking lot. We talked about some SFW & NSFW stuff. He then touches and grabs my legs again like he's trying to get me in the mood. He lowered down his shorts and boxer and then grabs my hand and put it on his dick while sporting that smile again.  Still holding my hand, he moves my hand up and down on his dick like he's guiding me to do a handjob again. I'm a bit hesitant to do it and I can feel my heart beating fast kasi nga first time kong gagawin yon but still I did it. Tapos pinush nya yung back ko pababa na nakatapat yung mukha sa dick nya. His shaved dick looks so big with the right thickness. He looks very clean not just the dick ha. Pinapasubo nya yung dick nya sa kin. Sinubo ko naman yung etits nya ng 1-2 times ata tapos napa-ayos ako ng upo. So ayon sinabi ko sa kanya I can‚Äôt, sabi nya tama lang daw ginawa ko. Akala nya yung sa pagsubo sa dick nya ang sinasabi ko. Akala nya na takot ako baka makita kami sa labas. Lumipat pa kami sa parking sa harap. Pero parang napaisip ako if tama ba ginagawa ko. Hindi yung blowjob ang sinasabi ko ha. I really thought kasi na normal date lang sya tapos biglang ganon. Naisip ko bigla pangaral nila sa akin. Sinabi ko sa kanya na hindi ko dapat ginawa yon. Na ayaw ko ng ganoon. Like hindi ako nakikipaghook up. Nakalimutan ko na sinabi nya pero we decided na ihahatid na nya ako pauwi. 

OTW home nag-iisip pa rin ako if ano bang dapat gawin. Iniisip ko yung pangaral sa akin at ayaw ko ng ganong set up at the same time nacucurious din ako. Na nasa tamang edad naman ako. Iniisip ko din na ayaw kong mag sex kami sa car lalo na virgin ako. Pero naisip ko din walang mangyayaring ganon kasi may period ako, it will be messy at ayaw ko din talaga madevirginize sa unang meet. Tumitingin tingin din sya sa akin parang alam nyang nag-iisip isip pa ako. Tapos di pa nakakatulong yung nakakalusaw at nakakalaglag panty nyang smile haysss. 

So ayon, sabi nya let‚Äôs try again. I didn‚Äôt say yes and I didn‚Äôt say no din so he took it as a yes na rin. Naghanap kami ng magandang spot na walang masyadong sasakyan na dumadaan. So napunta kami sa parang dike na halos truck lang at madalang lang dumadaan. Tahimik at halos makikita ay green. Nature lover yan.üå≥üå¥

"First time experiencing Yoni, and definitely won't be the last","Ayun, so dahil bored tayo today, I figured the best way to pass time is to share about yung recent yoni experience ko. First ever post ko pala to and medj mahaba sya kasi ayaw ko idivide into parts, so bear with me sa pagkwento ko. I'll also try to be as detailed as possible sa mga nangyari for those who are into details, pero since it has been a week na since the massage, I might be missing some details here and there, and baka may mga ibang bagay na di na accurate ung recall ko. Also putting a disclaimer, in all caps, THAT THIS IS NOT AN INVITATION TO HOOK-UP, NOR AN INVITATION TO SEND UNSOLICITED DICK PICS. This is just me sharing and memorializing my experience.

Actually, matagal tagal na kong lurker sa Reddit (using my real account haha) pero recently ko lang nalaman na may-gantong sub pala haha (shoutout sa mga ka-opisina kong tambay ng sub na to HAHAHA. Hulaan nyo na lang kung ako to o hindi HAHAHA). So ayun na nga. Nagba-browse browse lang tas may mga nabasa akong mga posts regarding sa mga experiences ng iba about sa Yoni massage. At dun ko na nga nakilala si boss amo u/TongueTwist143. Prior to Reddit, nababasa basa ko na yung about sa Yoni, pero wala akong alam kung san or sino ang nago-offer ng Yoni massage. So laking tuwa ko ng malaman kong nage-exist si TongueTwist. So nagkausap kami and nakapag-set na din kung kelan pwede magpa-massage, at luckily, nag-align ang mga bagay bagay.

Initially during sa chats namin, medj shy akiz kasi umiral ang pagiging mahiyain ko HAHAHA. Kaya medj kinakabahan ako pag nagkita na kami kasi baka mamaya, ang boring kong kasama ü•π Pero he was very reassuring and kept telling me na okay lang yun and he kept putting my mind at ease. And by the time na nag-meet na kami, nag-break na yung ice to the point na tinawanan ko sya pag bukas ko ng door (sorna ulit tawa ako ng tawa. Sobrang benta kasi talaga HAHAHA). 

So ayun na nga. Nagkita na kami. Tamang kamustahan at chika chika lang muna before kami mag-start. Tas nag-ask na sya if game na daw ba. Sabi ko freshen up lang ako sandali (kahit na kakaligo ko lang bago ako bumyahe at di naman ako napawisan nun, but still hahaha). So quick shower ako, and then paglabas ko, naka-dim light na and nagsispray na sya ng mist, tas may pa-sounds pa na parang pang-spa, so very spa vibes na nga. So ayun na, pinadapa nya na ko tas minassage. Tas dahil naging comfy na ko, forda chika ang ferson. So ayun. Massage sa buong likod tas magbibigay sya ng short reason bat nya ginagawa ung massage ganun. May times na napapaungol ako sa massage kasi ang sarap talaga tas narerelax ako. Nung minamassage na nya yung sa may butt area ko, may times na sumasagi sa pussy ko so syempre medj maeexcite si akows pero teaser pa lang pala lols. 

Tas pinaharap na nya ko. Minassage face pati ulo tas pina-inhale na scent. Super relaxing as in huhu. Then minassage nya ung legs ko and thighs and may times na napapaungol talaga ko. So matatawa sya tas sasabihin na, wala pa tayo sa fun part hahahaha. Pero eto na ngaaaa. Nagstart na sya imassage boobs ko. Shutakels. Ansarap! Iniiwasan nya ung areola muna and ung nipples. Tamang massage sa boobs muna tas mga sensual touches. Then bababa sa thigh and then up sa boobs ulit. Sometime in between, sinusuck nya na boobs ko (disclaimer, we had talked about this beforehand and both of us consented and no one was forced to do anything. Para lang malinaw po. Consent is a must, people!). Nagmamassage na din sya outside the vaginal area and onting tease sa may pussy at clit. At this point, super di ko na mapigilan ung moans ko and napapa-whimper na ko sa sarap, and everytime na magaaccelerate heart rate ko, sasabihan nya ko to relax and inhale. E di ayun naaaa. Patuloy sya sa pag-massage sa boobs and vaginal area ko, pero this time, dahil nga naka-bukaka na ko, ung dick nya (still covered ng shorts) nagrurub na sa pussy ko so moan malala (somewhere along the way, tinanggal na nya ung shirt nya).

At eto na nga po ang exciting part. Dito na medj blurry ang lahat kasi ang sarap na ng mga pangyayari. Minassage nya ulit ung vag area, tas tinanong nya ko kung pasok na daw nya fingers nya. Napa-tango na lang ako tas whisper ng yes. Then fuck! Shuta! Ang saraaaap! Ang hirap iexplain nung pleasure na nararamdaman ko at that time. Napapa-moan na lang ako malala tas di ko na masundan ng maayos ung nangyayari. Pero I remember, nag-cum ako tas tinanong nya ko, gusto mo malaman anong daliri ung nakapasok? Tas yawa. Pinakita nya na gamit nya 2 little fingers lang. Yawa yan HAHAHA. Di pa ko naniwala, so ilang beses pa nya pinakita sa kin ung pinapasok nya. I cannot stress this enough, pero ansarap talaga mga marecakes huhu. Sinabi nya din na wala sa haba o sa taba yan pero nasa kung pano ihihit ung spot üëå 

At this point, shuta di ko na talaga maintindihan ang mga nangyayari kasi ang sarap na HAHAHA. Ang naalala ko na lang is nakapasok na ung daliri nya tas sinistimulate nya g spot ko. It went on for several minutes until nag-stop sya sandali para water break daw. Tas sabi nya, nasa 40% pa lang daw ako. Sabi ko, gusto ko ng 100% pero sabi nya baka at the most lang daw is 60% and normal lang daw yun sa first time. (As a palaban na ferson, di matanggap ng pride ko to HAHAHA. Char lang hahaha. Pero dito talaga makikita na he's taking into consideration ung well-being ng mga minamassage nya. Na ginagawa nya lang kung yung hanggang san kaya mong itake).

So ayun na nga. Water break then onting chika. Then pinaupo nya ko sa bed with my hands on my sides then fininger nya ko. Shuta, sinasabi ko talaga, may something yung kamay nya huhu. Then sinusuck na nya ung isang boob ko and nilalaro ung isa, then alternate. Tas tamang momol kami, and my gulay. Sherep nya kumiss at ang lambot ng lips huhu. Tas tinanong nya ko kung pasok na nya and if safe ako. Sabi ko, oo to both questions. Tas sabi nya, may condom sya sa bag. Kunin nya lang. Pero habang kinukuha nya yung condom sa bag, blinowjob ko sya, and feeling ko naman nasarapan sya kasi napapaungol sya (sana nga nasarapan ka boss amo at hindi courtesy lang yung pag-moan mo ü•π). So e di chupa onti then, nagmomol pa kami tas nirurub nya etits nya sa pussy ko then sinuot na nya condom, then pinasok na nya sa pussy ko yung dick nya. Shuta, ayorn. Pagka-sarap huhu. Again, disclaimer ulit na this was done with consent from the both of us and walang pilitang naganap and hindi na kasama yung sex sa massage proper. Sadyang mapupusok lang ang aming mga damdamin chz HAHAHA

Dahil masyado ng mahaba to, di ko na masyadong idedetalye ang mga bagay, pero mga naka-ilang rounds din kami, in various positions, with me losing count kung ilang beses akong nilabasan habang si koya nyo ay forda control kaya marathon talaga HAHAHA. Naranasan ko din ang house special na pa-oral ni boss amo, and my golly gulay, he lives up to his username huhu. Mga ilang beses ko nga din pala sya na-mura at nasabunutan dahil sa sarap ng mga pangyayari. Na-mention ko din sa kanya habang nagsha-shower kami na isang tao pa lang nakakapagpa-squirt sa kin and yun yung unang ex ko and that was some 11-12 years years ago (for context, I'm 29, turning 30 this year. You do the math). He seemed to take this as a challenge so sabi nya, humiga daw ako. So ayun, pina-squirt ako ni koya nyo in less than 5 minutes. Hayp yan. Tas bago kami mag-checkout, pina-squirt nya ko ulit. So by the time na checkout na at kumakain na kami ng dinner, nanginginig tuhod ko at sya, pinagtatawanan ako HAHAHA. 

So ayun na nga po ang aking kwento. Kung umabot kayo sa part na to, aba'y pagka-sipag nyo naman magbasa HAHAHA. Here's a cookie for you üç™ At sa yo, u/TongueTwist143. Magtutuos pa tayong muli HAHAHA. Ayun lamang pows. Salamat sa pagbabasa. Bow.

Mel's sexual frustration,"*Some people actually want me to talk about Mel, but I thought it‚Äôll be too dramatic. Luckily though, she‚Äôs a bit of a hoe too so I have a few stories about her to tell.*

*A little bit of background about my ex‚Äôs sister first. Mel is a year older than I am, yet she often calls me ‚Äòkuya‚Äô and treats me as her own older brother. She‚Äôs got a really beautiful face, but oddly enough she looks nothing like Kate. Mel likes her hair short, and Kate likes it the other way around. She always looked happy and contented, but beneath her mask is a heartbroken girl.*

***The naked truth:***

It was a dark, gloomy Saturday morning when I woke up next to Kate. We‚Äôd been drinking the night before and might have fucked a lot because my dick felt sore. I was awakened by the sound of pop music, the type that makes me want to slit my throat because the singers used too much autotune. 

The music was coming from outside the room where Kate and I were sleeping. The scent of beauty soap and flowers filled the air. Then the room‚Äôs door swung open and lo and behold was Mel in a towel, she must have taken a bath. Even with my eyelids half-open, I can see the way Mel‚Äôs tits shape the towel.

Mel was moving quick, she must be in a hurry. Her back was facing towards me when she removed the towel covering her bare body. I should‚Äôve closed my eyes out of respect that she‚Äôs Kate‚Äôs sister, but I didn‚Äôt, I kept looking at her. She had a fair complexion, her ass was in perfect shape, her legs and arms weren‚Äôt that hairy and it‚Äôs unreal how I found it so erotic.

She raised her arms and put deodorant on both her armpits. She then put her leg on top of a monobloc chair, and put lotion on it, and did the same to the other, and to her arms. Mel turned around and, may the lord above has witnessed, looked at me.

Mel saw me looking at her naked body, and now she‚Äôs facing me with those boobs of hers. And her pussy, the stories that Kate told me that Mel doesn‚Äôt shave because it‚Äôs a matter of pride for her, WAS FREAKING TRUE. Good thing I suppose that her pussy‚Äôs covered by her bush. Mel‚Äôs eyes were looking through me, but she didn‚Äôt look like she‚Äôs about to kill me, she just looked embarrassed and, in a way, proud.

All this time we didn‚Äôt make any noise to wake Kate up, she didn‚Äôt scream and I didn‚Äôt lose my mind. She looked magnificent, unbelievable, and just alluring. To scale, her figure resembles that of u/shesafairy (paypal her or something guys, she giving us quality nudes, the least you can do is respect her and not send her unsolicited dick pics). Mel stopped looking like a fool, she closed her eyes and she squeezed her tits for a bit, turned around and spread her ass.

She took her bra, panties, and the clothes she was going to wear and stepped out of the room. A few minutes later, peaked into the room and said that she was heading out and I should lock the door. It was one of the luckiest moments in my life, and I am absolutely grateful that Mel kept it as a secret between the two of us.

***She's such a mess:***

It was one of those nights that I was staying at their place again. There‚Äôs probably an imaginary checklist for all of my stories. Staying at Kate‚Äôs place? Check. It‚Äôs raining outside and it‚Äôs freezing inside? Check. Kate and I had just had sex multiple time before slept? Check, check, check. 

Although this night was different. Mel was out drinking with her loser of a boyfriend, let‚Äôs call him Mike just for the sake of it. Mel told us to not wait for her to come home that night because she might stay at Mike‚Äôs place because they ‚Äúmay or may not fuck depending on how drunk he can make me,‚Äù said Mel.

So we didn‚Äôt wait for her, we just slept after watching a movie. And in the middle of the night, around 2AM, I woke up because of the stupid doorbell and Kate‚Äôs phone ringing. Mel was calling Kate‚Äôs phone then it went to missed calls, then my phone rang, and when I answered, Mel was on the other line, sobbing.

""Ian pabukas ng pinto,‚Äù you can feel the sadness from over the phone just by hearing her.
I got up the bed, went and open the door. Mel was leaning on the door so hard that she fell when it swung open, fortunately I caught her. She reeked of something so foul and sour.

I closed and locked the door. ‚ÄúAnong nangyari sayo?‚Äù I asked her, but she didn‚Äôt reply. She was still crying, so I helped her get up, took her purse and set it aside. Mel hugged me, and I realized the foul smell was vomit AND MEL GOT SOME OF IT ON ME, FUCK!

‚ÄúSandali lang, masusuka na ata ako,‚Äù she rushed towards the bathroom, knelt in front of the toilet and just spewed a lot, I had to assume that it was her dinner. So I knelt beside her, held her hair, and stroked her back.

I helped her up again and cleaned her face. Then she told me that she got too drunk that she passed out, and luckily nobody sexually assaulted her because she was with a friend. But she saw Mike making out with another girl. Mel said she got furious and sad at the same time that she stormed out, went home early even if it‚Äôs raining. 

‚ÄúTulungan mo akong maghubad maghubad,‚Äù she said, her voice calm, and her eyes were staring right at mime. She looked like she was about to pounce and kiss me. But she‚Äôs still drunk, and I have a girlfriend.

She must have noticed the confusion in my eyes and explained, ‚Äútulungan mo akong maghubad para makapagshower ako!‚Äù

So I did, I helped her out of her blouse, I pulled her skirt down. I unhooked her bra and she took it off. Her eyes were still staring at me, while mine were staring at her tits and imagined what it would feel like to suck on them. I shrugged the idea and turned around.

Mel hugged me from behind, and grabbed my dick. It was already throbbing, but I pushed Mel‚Äôs hands away, pushed her to the wall, and choked her. It was just a light choke, the way I would choke Kate. I nudged Mel‚Äôs pussy with my knee, and realized I shouldn‚Äôt have done that.

‚ÄúHuwag kang maingay, ayaw kong mawala sa akin ang girlfriend ko, okay?‚Äù I whispered in Mel‚Äôs ears. She went to the bathroom to shower, while I got her towel. I cooked her noodles so she has something to eat after she cleaned herself.

Then I went back to bed, Kate‚Äôs still sleeping heavily. I guess god made her sleep so soundly that she probably didn‚Äôt hear Mel and I talking. I kissed Kate on the forehead knowing that I had wronged her. I slept disappointed with myself that night.

I guess that‚Äôs probably it for now, guys!",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/c7uxdf/mels_sexual_frustration/,t2_3urlykkr,2019-07-02 00:20:59,16
The start of something new,"I was gonna write about my first time with a guy. But, I had a really hot experience recently, and couldn't resist writing about it.


By now, I'm pretty confident about my gender identity and sexualty. I present myself as masculine and straight-acting (if that's even a word), but I'm openly bisexual. I am physically attracted to masculine men and feminine women. But, I've only ever been emotionally attracted to women.


A couple of months ago, I found myself single, horny and alone. My last (exclusive) fuck buddy had dropped the dreaded three-word, eight-letter bomb, a few months prior, as he emptied his load inside my spent hole‚Äì and I had to cut him off.


I was supposed to meet up with a girl from Tinder, but she flaked at the last minute. It was frustrating to say the least. I briefly considered contacting the previous guy, ultimately decided against it.


I downloaded Grindr, posted a headless photo of me wearing only a jock strap, and waited. It was a long arduous hour, filled with unsolicited dick pics, overly choosy men (as am I), and jejes with horrid grammar. I almost gave up and was about to log out when ""Hey"" contacted me.


He had his back turned, and the photo was taken from a distance. But I could see his muscular legs, and he seemed pogi (I like to think I have a sixth sense for this). Plus, he was only 300 meters away. So, I took the bait.


""Fun?"" He had asked.


""Sure. Pic?"" came my reply. It was almost clockwork. My profile had the GGSS ""No pic no reply"" tag but I was bored and horny so alright.


""Got a place?""


""Yeah,"" I was rather annoyed he didn't send a pic. 


""Can I come over? I really need a good fuck right now.""


""Sure, send a pic.""


Then, he did. He was out of my league‚Äì chinito, gwapo, and with the body of an athlete who stopped working out for a month (macho with a small layer of fat). I sent some photos back. I wasn't bad looking myself but I was more twinkish than macho, at that time.


At this point, I was feeling sleepy, and figured he'd probably flake on me anyway so I bade him good night.


""Wait,"" he said, ""You said you were bored and horny?""


""I am. But I'm a bit sleepy na e. Body hurts from gym. Maybe tom?"" I put my phone down and brewed some tea as part of my nightly ritual. 


My phone vibrated a few times and I saw a string of messages from him.


""Promise?""


""I really need a good fuck now.""


""I'll make you feel good.""


""Please?""


""Heyyyy""


In fairness, I felt really gwapo reading those messages. 


""Tara."" So, we met up outside my village and I picked him up with my car.


Tangina ang gwapo niya. HAHAHA He looked like a cross between Xian Lim and Ian Veneracion. He was wearing a blue shirt and basketball shorts. He gave a shy smile, as he boarded my car.


We drove in silence back to my house. It was always awkward when with a new guy/girl‚Äì moreso with this really cute guy. As I parked, I turned to him and asked, ""Oks ka lang?"" I felt like a mere mortal beside this guy. 


He nodded and replied, ""Yeah. I like your smile."" He put his hand over mine. Tangina. Ito normally linyahan ko sa girls e. I turned off the engine, leaned towards him, and kissed him.


""Kala ko antok ka?"" He teased with a dimpled smile.


""You woke me up e,"" I placed my hand on his crotch. I felt his cock getting hard. ""Tara na.""


I was really nervous, and struggled in opening the door with my keys. When I finally did, he pushed me in, shut the door, grabbed my face, and kissed me hard.


Fuck. Ang pogi ko. He kissed really well. But, having learned from a pro for my first time, and having twelve years of practice, I was not going down without a fight. 


I spun us around and pushed him against the door. I ran my fingers down his short hair, and took his lower lip between my lips. I sucked and kissed, and brushed my tongue against his. I slid my hands across his back, to his arms, chest and stomach, feeling every inch of his body. 


The thing I like about the male body is how hard it is. Female bodies are nice and soft‚Äì but a man's body has a way of making you feel warm, safe and small. I moaned as his large hands roamed my body.


""You are so fucking hot,"" he whispered to my ear, before taking my earlobe between his teeth. I held onto his shoulders, as I moaned and arched my back. I pushed him away, and took him by the hand.


""Let's go up."" I led him up to my room, and pushed him on the bed. I mounted him, looked him in the eyes, as I took my shirt off and said, ""Ang sarap mo."" 


I ground on his dick as I slid my hands beneath his shirt and groped his chest. I couldn't get enough how strong his body felt. He practically tore his shirt off, grabbed me by my cheeks, and pulled me down for a kiss. His hands slid down my back and into my boxers. He squeezed my ass as we kissed, before getting me naked.


Tangina. Ang hot niya. Ang sarap niyang halikan. Gigil na gigil kami sa isa't isa. I moved my lips to his cheeks, down to his neck (I loved his perfume), and chest.


I took his left nipple between my teeth and flicked my tongue against it. He moaned and pushed my head harder against his chest, ""Sige pa, dedein mo ako, baby.""


So, I did. I used to smoke before transitioning to vape, and then completely giving up the bad habit(s). Looking back, I was never addicted to tobacco or nicotine. I just needed something in my mouth‚Äì and my partners' bodies helped fill that void.


I lightly sucked around his areola, with occasional flicks to his nipple. I loved how hard his nipple was and how fast his heart beat against his chest. I felt his dick straining against my shoulder/arm as I moved to his other nipple. I pressed my body against his dick, making him push up and moan. 


He took me by the face and pulled me for another tender kiss. I traced his chiseled jaw with my licks and kisses before kissing my way down to his neck, shoulder (ang sarap ng pawis niya), chest, down to his abs.


As I reached his crotch, I looked up at him before giving a heavy lick across his shaft. He arched his back and moaned, ""Tangina ang sarap mo."" I grabbed his boxers by my teeth and pulled down. As I did, my cheek pressed against his abs. The lower his shorts went, the harder and thicker his cock felt across my cheek. It felt so warm. I nuzzled my cheek against it before planting a light kiss.  He shifted his weight so he could take his boxers totally off.


I kissed around his thigh and sucked. He gasped , ""Huwag dyan, nakikiliti ako!"" As I licked his inner thigh, my tongue brushed against his heavy balls.


I loved that he trimmed. I shifted my lips to his balls and sucked. My nose was pressed against his dick. He moaned and cussed under his breath. He grabbed onto my head, trying to force me to take his dick. 


But, I'm no one's bitch, and I didn't budge. I wanted him to beg, writhe, and cry for me. Something about a grown man, more handsome and stronger than me, turning weak and pliable to my touch gets me horned up.


When he finally did, I kissed my way from his balls to his shaft. It was around 6"" long, and had the right amount of thickness (maybe slightly wider than the girth of a tissue roll carton). It had an upward curve and a nice mushroom head.


If I had to describe his dick in a word, it'd be ""gorgeous."" It had the perfect balance of squishiness and hardness. The thing I love about penises is that they filled the void smoking left in my lips' need for suction (that eating pussy could never do). Don't get me wrong. Eating pussy is nice is if I wanted to lick, nibble, and dive‚Äì but nothing can top sucking cock, bobbing my head up and down a hard shaft, brushing my tongue on the underside of his head, and gagging on it as it enters my throat.


He bucked and flailed as I made love to his dick, whispering obscenities and admiration at my skill. I guided his hands onto my head, and he got the cue. He grasped at my hair, and began to bob my head up and down to meet his thrusts.


He went on for a while before pulling me up for another kiss. We locked eyes once more and kissed like long-time lovers. I pushed a strand of his hair back, and brushed his cheek with my knuckles before falling into him, and taking his lips. He wrapped his arms around me and rolled me on my back, so his weight was on me. I loved how he felt on top of me as he kissed my neck, my cheeks and my nose.


My hands fell on his shoulders as he worshipped my body. I rubbed his back and tugged on his hair, while he thrusted his dick against mine. We were around the same size, and his dick felt so right over mine. I moaned at the sensation and wrapped my legs around him.


I rutted my dick against his and whispered how horny he's making me. ""Fuck me like one of your girls, daddy,"" I told him. It was a guess‚Äì but I think he was bi like me.


He pinned me by my hands and hissed at my ear. ""Ang sarap sarap mo, baby. Gusto mo ba dick ko?""


""Yes, daddy,"" I replied, ""Please give it to me.""


He found the condom and lube on my side table and equipped himself. I whimpered as he fingered me. It has been so long since my hole was breached by another.


""Masakit?"" He asked with concern, ""Ok ka lang?""


I cupped his face with my hands and kissed him, ""Virgin ako, daddy. Please be gentle."" The last time I bottomed was four months ago.


I could tell that that turned him on since his dick throbbed against my leg. He kissed me tenderly while loosening my hole. He rolled us over so I was on top.


Looking me in the eyes, he positioned me on top of his dick, ""Tell me if it hurts, baby.""


Shit. I love this talk. I liked the fact that I was the one being coaxed and comforted‚Äì things I normally did. I leaned in for a kiss as my hole opened up for his cock. 


His dick felt so big inside me that I had to pause. He gave me a gentle kiss and said, ""You're doing so good, baby. Ang init-init ng butas mo. Don't rush. We have all the night.""


Ang hot talaga nitong si gago. I relaxed myself as I lowered myself some more. I was halfway down on his cock when I decided to move up and down. He moaned in appreciation but didn't really move, yet, as he waited for my signal. What a gentleman. When I felt like I was ready, I lowered myself all the way down.


We both moaned as I felt his thighs touch my butt. He cupped each asscheek with a hand, looked up at me (I nodded), and pulled me up‚Äì before promptly pulling me down his shaft. I arched my back, let out a gasp, and fell on his chest at the sensation.


I watched his eyes roll back as he claimed my hole as his, using my body to pleasure himself. We kissed as he fucked me. Personally, I wasn't a fan of getting fucked. With men, I just prefer to suck cock. But, this guy was pretty good.


He sat up and locked me in an embrace, without removing his dick from my hole. He then laid me down gently before promptly fucking the shit out of me. He pulled my legs over his shoulders and looked at me with a manic glint on his eyes.


""Masarap ba? Ang sikip-sikip mo! Kung di ka lang hayok kanina, maniniwala na akog virgin ka e!""


I laughed before pulling his face for another kiss. ""For this dick, daddy, I'll be your virgin and whore."" That was his cue to fuck me harder‚Äì with longer strokes than ever, pulling all the way back, pushing all the way in.


Eventually, he pulled out. I felt so empty. He pushed me forward on all fours. There was mirror beside my bed, and I realized what he wanted. He applied more lube as he entered me from behind. He was so big, I arched my back. I watched myself mewl, moan, writhe at the feeling of him inside me. His eyes locked at mine in the mirror while he enjoyed the show.


He pulled all the way out before thrusting all the way in. I fell forward, overwhelmed, and held onto the sheets. He grabbed my hips and began pulling me back to meet his thrusts. I relaxed my hole as he thrusted, and squeezed as he pulled out. He let out grunts and groans.


Watching him roll his eyes back while he fucked me, or glare as he focused on not coming was so fucking hot. He pushed me all the way down, closed my legs, and leaned on top of me. Fuck ang sarap niya talaga. 


He turned my face to kiss him. I couldn't move as his hands were on mine. His fingers squeezed mine and I squeezed back, moaning at every movement. I was in ectasy. All that mattered was he was leaning on top me, kissing my neck, his dick fucking my hole. Soon , his thrusts became faster and harder. His breathes became harsher and more frantic. He bit on my neck and I was his eyes roll back, through the mirror.


""Buntisin mo ako, daddy!"" I yelled. That did it. He let out one last thrust before collapsing on top of me. We stayed that way for a long time. Soon, we rolled over so I was on his chest.


He took off the condom and tied it before tossing it on the bin beside the bed. He planted a kiss on my forehead, ""Thanks, I needed that."" We made out a few more minutes before he spooned me.


He got hard again, and I sucked him off. I let him cum in my mouth, and he kissed me like he didn't care. That was when I knew I'd found my new fuck buddy.


Eventually, we cleaned up, got dressed, and exchanged numbers. That was the best sex either of us had in a long time, and we agreed to meet the next night. I dropped him off, and had a very good sleep.


More stories coming soon. ;)",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/c7n3ku/the_start_of_something_new/,t2_baqfr5d,2019-07-01 10:43:58,34
A Sudden Weekend Workshop,"**^(Note:)** ^(This is going to be a two-part series because I feel I have typed enough for today, and that we only have a certain tolerance for a lengthy block of written work. I do apologize in advance if this will come off as a cliffhanger, but I promise to compensate on the next part.) 

For many that I have been with, fucking a teacher is already a kink, but I have never imagined practicing the profession while having sex. Most of my partners tend to be the one in control, and I do enjoy being a submissive after a long day of taking in charge. But as Margaret Fuller would say, *nature will provide an exception to every rule*. Steve is one of those random exceptions. 

I first met Steve while I was mindlessly scrolling through phr4r. He had a really engaging ad, and I just had to reply. I wasn‚Äôt really looking for another hookup, but I thought *sayang naman* if I let go of chatting with someone who has a promising personality. More often than not, being able to sustain a good conversation is still better than mindless sex.

What is special about Steve is his aptitude to keep things rolling with a dash of humor. For one, we could shift the dialogue from a ridiculously funny experience to a commentary about Evangelical Christianity and then to something naughtier. Things never got boring, and I am fond of teasing and testing his patience. 

There was even a point when I, partly curious to the limits of his spontaneity, had asked him to send a video of him dancing. I was really just tripping that time, and wasn't really expecting anything. Or maybe I was hoping for something sultry; we had been sharing some of our kinks after all. But the guy, bless his heart, made an effort of replying with a vigorous ocho-ocho. 

He was something else. 

I had other non-exclusive fuck buddies, but I actively maintained Steve in my tele for his humor and decency. He never sent an unsolicited dick pic nor demanded for my nudes. For some unknown reason, that made me want to tease him more. Like I wanted to coax this guy to ask me out for a fuck. Maybe I just had a kink for corrupting people who show strong mental resolve, or maybe I was simply curious to see how far a person who is just beginning in the hookup culture would go. But I kept on teasing. Of course, I could have propositioned something direct, but it is more challenging to have it organically come out from him. It has become a mental game I play with myself.

But he did not respond to the stimulation. In fact, he purposely ignored them. Late replied to me that he needed to focus on law school and other stuff. Okay. Maybe some other time then. Anyway, I was still invested in other pursuits. Sakto I had another hookup scheduled at the end of the week. 

So Friday came, and I was looking forward to destress and have my pussy pounded. I timed out early, texted my housemate that I would not be coming home for the night, and made sure all assessments were checked and turned it. It was pouring that night, so I took a cab to Cubao

Only to find out that I got stood up.

It is very frustrating to be ghosted. Hyping myself the entire week, sowing seeds of kindness to entitled students since I thought I am going to be seeded as well, spending effort to show up presentable and on time‚Ä¶only to be blocked on the day I was preparing for. I was pretty much livid. 

So I spent the next few hours stewing in Books and Borders when Steve texted,

""'sup?"" 

I guess he was trying to be cool, but it was bad timing. It came off as if I did not even deserve the whole ""what's up?"" and it amplified the feeling of being ghosted. Incensed, I replied with a lackluster ""K."" Man, I was pissed. 

He probably sensed that I was in a bad mood because the next thing that came in were series of apologies. *Sorry na.* 

Maybe an apology was what I needed that night because I softened and my teacher rationality kicked in: *Hey, it wasn't this guy's fault. You're misplacing your anger.* So I told him the context. Maybe talking to him would cheer him up.

""Tara, let's fuck,"" he said. I had to do a double look since it is out of character. It was plain and assertive. No followed-up joke or sugarcoating. Surprising. It was something I wanted to hear from him, but this was so sudden. And I wasn't really expecting any action now...but hey, that would *cheer me up*.

Not letting go of the opportunity, I asked him where he lived. Up north, he said. Like beyond QC north. The idea was preposterous, but I was already doing Math and Geography in my head. *How would I travel? How much would it cost me? What‚Äôs my back up plan if things go south?* Oh the things I will do for a fuck. A fuck that has no guarantees if it's going to be good or bad.

To add to the conundrum, the rain intensified, and maybe that was God's way of saying, ""Uwi ka na, Anna. Spare this guy the trouble."" Maybe Steve and I were not supposed to meet. Maybe I was not worthy to be immortalized as the teacher who ticked one of his bucket list. Maybe I needed that fare for something more important. 

*But hey*, an inner voice reminded, *the guy had a great personality*. If it didn‚Äôt work out, maybe we can laugh about it together. 

So I texted him that I'll be taking Grab and I‚Äôll see him in an hour. Maybe he can share the bill with me? It did not faze him. Instead, he asked me if I do blowjobs.

*Of course I do, silly. Just you wait.* 

This isn't meant to brag, ha? It is just that during the time that I was still promiscuous, I had this *fetish-but-self-justified-as-a-social-experiment* practice of tasting my hookup's cum. Ew for some, but I never shirked away from the responsibility of Science. So blowjobs are really on the table. I even kept tabs in my mind on who had the best tasting one. Steve‚Äôs fairly okay naman, but we‚Äôll get more to that later. 

After an obscenely expensive grab ride, I arrived at his condo. It was still raining, but he took the effort of waiting at the driveway with a ready umbrella. Sakto naman face value, but more importantly mukhang cuddly. Oks manoks.

We went up, ordered fast food, and talked about things in general. We ranted, shared some fries, and talked some more. I asked if he was living alone, and he said his mom would visit occasionally. I looked around and studied the flat‚Äôs personality: kept but not curated. Functional. Reasonably cluttered. No Ted Bundy bells suggesting I ought to run. Okay.

I asked if I could shower. He gave me -in his own words- his *fuccboi* shirt. It was a gray V-neck which has a breast pocket similar to what white-sneakered shoes fuckboys would wear on a casual hot day. I chuckled at the term, and then at the thought of someone who was fairly new at sex owning a fuccboi shirt. Irony? Or a foreshadowing perhaps?

I went to the shower, marveled at the array of hygiene products, and thanked the Lord for a selection of toiletries. It‚Äôs not every day that I get to choose between Palmolive Pink and Dove (?) at a hookup's place. I couldn‚Äôt remember the last option to be honest. But Steve definitely takes care of himself and doesn‚Äôt confine himself with limited choices brought by fragile masculinity.

When I got dressed, that‚Äôs the only time it dawned on me that he only gave me a T-shirt. *Does he want me to come out with only this? Do I still need to wear my teacher pants?* I decided to venture out with nothing but the shirt and my panties on. He was like, *Oh okay. Let‚Äôs just continue this upstairs*. If he liked or was mortified by what he saw, he didn‚Äôt let on. 

The loft upstairs was dark, but it got MOOD LIGHTS. Steve was the only guy I met who thought of lighting. It was really a nice touch, because it sets the tone of the next events to come. Like, we were done with bantering, lezzgo to business.

So we kissed, and he started to become so hungry for more. I like aggressive kissing. It turns me on. Steve was doing just that, and I was starting to want to make his kisses linger. I was teasing him with my tongue. My hands goading on his back and shoulders. Him on top.

BUT IT WAS GOING TOO FAST

Like really too fast because the next thing I knew was that I was still in the mood for kissing and he was already starting to take my panties off and spread my legs for entry. Startled, I swatted his hands away. Now it was his turn to be shocked. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going too fast.‚Äù I frowned. ‚ÄúYou have to take things slow.‚Äù

I think I accidentally used my teacher voice that time because he gave a look of a boy being reprimanded. I thought it was going to be over. But Steve, as I have said, was an exception. He rose through that embarrassment and used it as a learning experience. 

That kinda motivated me to play teacher. ;)",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/mbi2h1/a_sudden_weekend_workshop/,t2_4aqjg5rb,2021-03-24 00:05:59,28
[Primer] Tita Subby Explains Consent in English,"*EDIT:* *I totally forgot, but sending people nudes or engaging in sexting is a sexual act, even if it doesn't involve physical contact. So to the assholes who sent me unsolicited dick pics, you are major consent violators. I never consented to seeing your tiny dicks on my phone screen without any hello or preamble whatsoever.*

---

*Crossposting from [r/phbdsmgonewild](https://www.reddit.com/r/phbdsmgonewild/comments/eesrwx/primer_tita_subby_explains_consent_in_english/) with permission*.

**Also, Merry Christmas, pervs.**

---

Engaging in any sexual activity, however casual or transactional in nature, requires consent between both (or if you're frisky, more than two) parties.

What's consent basically? **Consent**, in general, is *permission for something to happen or agreement to do something*. In our case, we'll be focusing on discussing *sexual consent*.

Also, everything below is applicable to *all genders and all power dynamics*. In this case we're used to the hetero guys asking the girls to do stuff, and the girls thinking about it and saying yes. It's the 21st century, let's all be responsible and make consent our priority.

### Why is getting someone's consent before sexy time so important to us?

* **Basic human decency and respect** - As human beings, we have freedom of will to choose. When it comes to sex, which is very intimate, personal, and risky, people should be able to decide for themselves if they want it, with whom they want it, when they want it, how they want it, you get the drill. We respect people's agency, autonomy and boundaries.

* **Mutual enjoyment** - Sex is infinitely more enjoyable when everyone is enthusiastic about it, excited about it, and committed to having fun! You can only have that if everyone's on board.

* **Awareness of liability** - I wish I didn't have to emphasize it, but we don't want to violate anyone's freedom of choice when it comes to having sex. Any other way runs the risk of regret up to sexual assault or even rape.

### FRIES Model of Consent

[Planned Parenthood](https://plannedparenthood.tumblr.com/post/148506806862/understanding-consent-is-as-easy-as-fries-consent) (a sexual health organization in the US) released primers on consent using the FRIES acronym. Really tasty and catchy. So what does FRIES mean?

* **Freely given.** Consenting is a choice you make without pressure, manipulation, or under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Even if you're being paid for sex, you can say no and return the money if you feel you're unsafe, or you just don't feel like doing the deed.

* **Reversible.** Anyone can change their mind about what they feel like doing, anytime. Even if you‚Äôve done it before, and even if you‚Äôre both naked in bed. Even if you're married. Even if you just feel like farting and now it's all unsexy. They should tell their partner to slow down or stop.

* **Informed.** You can only consent to something if you have the full story. For example, if someone says they‚Äôll use a condom and then they don‚Äôt, there isn‚Äôt full consent. If someone wants to do bondage, and you both don't know how to do it or what the risks are, you could get hurt instead of getting any pleasure.

* **Enthusiastic.** When it comes to sex, you should only do stuff you WANT to do, not things that you feel you‚Äôre expected to do. Even as a partner (in a marriage or long term relationship), none of us are expected to put out for sex. Of course, healthy sex is almost always part of a healthy relationship, but it shouldn't be a chore if you don't feel like it. If you have issues with your libido, or you feel you are too tired, talk it out with your partner and get proper help. Or, in case you're just not sexually compatible, discuss it like adults and find a solution that works for you.

* **Specific.** Saying yes to one thing (like going to the bedroom to make out) doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôve said yes to others (like having sex). This is especially important in BDSM where a lot of the kinks are very specific and risky. If I consent to being spanked with an open hand it doesn't mean I want to be spanked with a crop. I fucking hate stingy pain, but really, I don't need a reason.

### Responsibilities of a Partner (Asker)

*Asker - the person doing the asking.*

1. **Check to see if you or your partner are in the right frame of mind to consent.** Right frame of mind means someone is in a good physical condition and of clear mind to make decisions. They aren't intoxicated, emotional, or desperate. Intoxication is an iffy subject, since a lot of people use this as an excuse to regret what they did the next day. Own your decisions, make them sober if you can.

1. **Be informed and prepared** - This means, before engaging in any sexual activity, make sure you are informed of the advantages and risks. It ranges from knowing basic sexual safety like how babies are made, how to wear condoms to protect from STDs, how to test for pregnancy, how to check for STDs, and what is proper consent. If you can't grok this basic shit, why do you think you should be able to choke someone with its risk of permanent injury of death? And please, buy your own fucking condoms.

1. **Explicitly ask for consent** before having sex or engaging in other physical or sexual activities (light touching to BDSM included). When I say explicitly, spell it out. *""Pwede ba ako pumasok sa kwarto mo?""* **NOT EQUAL TO** *""Pwede ka ba kantutin?""* Don't ever assume as the askee or the asker.  We are all adults, fuck euphemisms. Strive for clarity.

1. **Ensure that consent is ongoing and enthusiastic.** Watch for their reaction. If you suspect they're fake orgasming, ask them. The least damage will be you're awful at sex and they're not enjoying it, the worst will be they feel they're being forced and don't really want it. When in doubt, ask. *""Shet, babe, sarap ko ba kumantot?"" ""Hmm, idk.""*
 
1. **Respect safewords and boundaries.** A simple NO would suffice to stop any action, but *RED* or *pangolin* is a good one too. If they say you shouldn't grab their hair, don't. If you're not sure if slapping their butt would be pleasurable to them, ask.

### Responsibilities of a Partner (Askee)

*Askee - the person expected to answer yes or no.*

1. **Ensure you are in the right frame of mind to consent.** If you have any issues, regrets, fears, anything that stops you from saying yes enthusiastically, stop and say so. You think you're too tired? Too drunk? Too depressed? Too manic? Too horny? If it precludes you from making safe decisions, stop. You don't even owe anyone an explanation. **A no is a NO.**

1. **Be informed and prepared** - Same as the asker, you should also be equally informed of what they ask you to do. If you're going to be tied, it doesn't mean that you should put your entire trust on your rigger. Know at least the basic ties, risks, eventualities. Also, buy your own condoms. I hate to be misogynistic, but having it happen several times, some guys will do anything to get out of using protection. Better yet, don't fuck a guy with this attitude, he can go have blue balls.

1. **Be firm with your boundaries**. Think about what you want and you don't want done. Doesn't matter how trivial it is. If you don't like getting your ass grabbed, say so. If you don't like bareback sex, say so. Boundaries are there to keep you safe.

1. **Be communicative. PEOPLE ARE NOT MIND READERS.** Say what you want and you don't want. If you can't assert yourself during negotiation and sex, you aren't mature enough to be engaging in it.

1. **Don't manipulate people.** One game is denying someone initially yet acquiescing after several attempts, because apparently saying yes the first time isn't proper because it makes you *easy*. This is bullshit and just sends confusing signals to people. Be clear and don't play childish games.

### Examples of Consent Violations

I kind of regret that I have to list this here, but after seeing several real-life examples from previous encounters and other Redditors, I've come to the conclusion that I have to emphasize this to everyone.

* **Physical force** - This is self explanatory. This assumes that your partner didn't consent to rape play or the like. BDSM is not an excuse for rape and only an abuser will think like that. High risk scenes are almost always negotiated and consensual. Any issue with your partner, she can stop (almost) anytime, and an experienced Dom will be prepared for that eventuality (quick release someone).

* **Dishonesty** - Tricking your partner into doing something they wouldn't do otherwise if informed properly. I've personally encountered several guys who would contact me for threesomes with their girlfriends. Upon being asked whether I could communicated directly with their partner, they would refuse, saying that they hadn't told her yet. One guy even told me, ""She'd say no when you ask her, but when she's in the bedroom with us, she'll do it. She's done it before."" This is disgusting behavior.

* **Unwarranted persistence** - *Tangina mo 'wag ka makulit.* Repeatedly cajoling someone into having sex expecting they would crumble under your persistence is NOT proper consent. If someone is so exhausted from fighting you, their yes is simply capitulation out of tiredness. It is not freely made nor enthusiastic. There's a local culture of toughing it out and hanging on when the object of your affection isn't reciprocating. That's not romantic, that's fucking creepy.

* **Assumptions** - Assuming that I make out with you means I'll agree to fucking you without being asked, is a consent violation. People have specific limits for specific tasks. If in doubt, ask.

### Consent and BDSM

Some people may be confused about the entire part of asking about consent when in a BDSM session or relationship. Isn't it the entire point of being a Dom and a sub is because the Dom has the power and the sub has to obey explicitly, even if they don't want to?

In fact, consent is one of the foundations of BDSM. Even with extreme plays such as rape kink / Consensual Non Consent, where a ""No"" may not stop the play, proper Doms (and participative subs) take steps to ensure everyone is on board and enjoying it.

The entire scope of it will be covered in future posts, especially when it comes to D/s relationships and negotiation. Let is suffice here that safewords are a measure of respect for both sides of the slash, regardless of how extreme you play. Everyone has limits, and to disregard them is to be unrealistic and abusive.

### Conclusion

*But asking for consent isn't sexy!* Some might say. Boner killer *daw* if someone asks you formally, *""May I touch your cock and suck it? Or should I just give you a handjob?""* Of course there are ways to phrase everything in such a way that it's still really hot, but clear and specific. You could discuss everything beforehand (and feel really aroused while you enumerate all the acts that they could do to you and vice versa): this is called **negotiation**. And to be honest, what's sexier than someone being an adult about fucking and taking charge of their safety and pleasure?

Consent is even applicable in non-sexual areas of our lives, anything that requires us making decisions affecting ourselves. As responsible adults, we should always be looking for our partner's enthusiastic yes to fucking! There's really nothing unsexier than a starfish, or worse, abuse. Let's make this a standard on PH Reddit and stop the abusive behavior we all hear about or even experience.

how would you feel...,"How do you or how would you feel if someone tells you that he/she masturbates or were to masturbate over your picture?  

I received messages asking if they could do cum tributes and then there's some telling me they did it over my picture.  

Personally, I understand that it happens. And a lot do this without telling the person in the photo or video. But when I'm confronted with the situation, my brows would instantly draw together. My mind would picture how the person did it, the sound, the reaction. It doesn't turn me on but I guess I find it hot about 5%? Lol  

I have nothing against this unless, of course, it's unsolicited. I do appreciate it when people ask first. Although I have never agreed with anyone when my photos are public, I think it's given your photo will be used.  

How do you feel about it?  

If I was younger and all conservative, I'd be really disgusted about it. But I want to be open-minded about anything sexual. I'd like to hear/read different points¬†of view here. It can be negative and positive. I'm all ears. Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/ut1lfa/how_would_you_feel/,t2_4lui5il5,2022-05-19 19:47:45,13
