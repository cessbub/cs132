So domestic violence prank is a thing now?,,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/qe82yf,t2_43b5a9hz,24/10/2021 0:26,437
Is it Domestic Violence? ,"I live in a household where it is fine when my father throws tantrums and harms us whenever he is angry or stressed, (because that’s the way he is). Whenever, we make mistakes big or small he would always, punish us, some are like the typical asian punishment but some are extremely abusive (it is his way of discipline??), like this one time when my sister was so hungry (she was around 7 yrs old) she served herself a mountain of rice and they teased her about her being overweight (which she was not) and told her to stop eating too much rice, naturally she was hurt and puts back some rice with some attitude, you can see it through her body language and all but my father was having none of her attitude, he throws her a cup full of hot soup at her face and she bleeding and I screamed at them that I am gonna kill them if she dies. 

From that moment, I never respected my father the way he wanted. I always talked back at him and if he can’t take it he would punch me, throw things at me and even threatened to kill me with his gun. My mother is always there to protect us not just me, but she is always the casualty, I always feel guilty about it and she would always tell us that my father is a loving father and is a good provider because he never left us and did his responsibilities as a father. I  always knew that what he always doing to us is always wrong. 

Now, I am 28 still battling about is it domestic abuse or just typical family issues?

PS. When you look from outside in our family seems like the typical happy family straight out from the bible, no signs of abuse. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/1bks4fz/is_it_domestic_violence/,t2_50yxkw6e2,22/03/2024 13:47,5

Domestic Violence in Apartment next door.,"Need serious advice on what to do. I reside in a condo with 24/7 security. In next door of my apartment there is a woman residing whose BF/Husband comes to the apartment once or twice per month semi/fully drunk at very late hours of the nights and ends up beating the woman, the cries of the woman can be clearly heard throughout the whole floor. I'm the only foreigner living in this floor thus I don't know what to do. None of the other neighbours seem to care or just are too afraid to do anything. I presume the woman herself is way too scared to report to anyone as the bf/husband is violent scum. Any advice is well appreciated, is it acceptable for me to physically stop him next time he comes to the building, as whenever he comes he knocks on the door of the apartment very hard and tries to force open the door, and when woman open the door he enters and beats her.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/zyxud7/domestic_violence_in_apartment_next_door/,t2_vato3oi5,30/12/2022 19:00,21

Severe Trauma Uncontrollable Shaking Domestic Violence 16yr old,"I had a very very severe case of trauma panic attack because of Domestic Violence, my mom put a knife sort of sharp object pushed me to the wall when I was injured and couldn't have escaped. I screamed on the top of my lungs for help. My body was shaking uncontrobally. Without the help of my cousins, my other family members assisting me to calm me down I would certainly have had a very rough time. At the same I was already suffering from anxiety and being stuck in my room 24 hrs a day because of quarantine. I was afraid, I didn't know what was happening to me, as of even right now my hands are still shaking uncontrobally as it just happened 10 minutes ago or so. My intention for writing this is to  calm my nerves and at the same time seek help and document what I am right now feeling. I'm 16 years old and for the first time of my life this is the first time I've experienced such a very severe case of trauma. My stomach was empty during all of this, I have a cast on my left hand after fracturing my 4th metacarpal bone and at the same day I had my worst panic trauma whatever attack which is today I had an accident stubbing my toe. My movement was deprived due to this meaning that when domestic violence was put up against me it took 100% of my will power to grab my mom's wrist and scream at the top of my lungs and run down the stairs. My family thought it was a fire but it was domestic violence. We had an argument or more of like a tantrum of me when I got my injury I would like to admit that as a 16 year old and of conscience i was in a state of rational thinking wait this isn't right I shouldn't be doing this I'll fix my room etc. I got hugged against the wall with a knife/sharp object very close to my throat. I was scared, cold, clueless when my severe trauma attacked. The uncontrollable shaking lasted for hours before it gradually slowly got better all thanks to my kind and loving cousins. But during that time including my nasal polyps makes it hard to breathe I was very sure I might pass out and I was unable to move due to the shaking of my body. Even with deep breaths it took a while for me to be in control. It seemed that eating food was the most important of all. Eating food calmed me down most likely because I'm hungry.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/g3p22f/severe_trauma_uncontrollable_shaking_domestic/,t2_ygaar,18/04/2020 23:13,9

Are there any articles/data of how the Arabs react whenever an Arab committed a domestic violence to a oversea worker?,Here in our country whenever we heard a news where an OFW was domestically abused by his/her Boss in the Middle East. Most of us will go nuts about them when we hear those new. However I haven't heard how the Arabs react whenever this thing happens.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/eqdfzg/are_there_any_articlesdata_of_how_the_arabs_react/,t2_2t8lzpcm,18/01/2020 15:26,0
"Is Raffy Tulfo, as a senator, then as host of Wanted sa Radio, a net negative or net positive to Philippine society and values","So occasionally when I am going home from work, our driver listens to Tulfo's Wanted sa Radio.

I didn't vote for him last election. I'm aware of some people saying his brand of Tulfo justice is a bad thing. It's part of the reason why I didn't vote for him.

After the elections, one of the legislative agenda he mentioned was about providing a law for domestic violence against men. That sounded like a fair law and I suppose it's about time we plug that problem in our domestic violence laws.

He's also in favor of returning ABSCBN's franchise so that is a good thing for free speech and the media institution.

Oh, I remember that thing he mentioned about Ivermectin. Hmm.

Then I noticed he wanted the DTI and FDA to do something about the sodium level in cup noodles, since it is bad for the health of our fellows who rely on it for almost daily food.

But then I've read an article from Manila Times that he did by claiming his time in a hearing where that isn't supposed to be the agenda.

As for his show Wanted sa Radio, he seems to help people. Not everything is also about contentious or litigous problems. He's also fairly careful in choosing who to help, like that soldier who went AWOL, a conveniently reasonable move because that is also commercially sound to do.

Anyway, what's your take on Tulfo? I'm not really for him to be a big negative or big net positive, even if he marginally net positive, then he's net positive, yeah? I'd like to know your reason for thinking so.

Thanks guys!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/yc5xh6/is_raffy_tulfo_as_a_senator_then_as_host_of/,t2_fsljiyxq,24/10/2022 16:36,15

Mayor Joy vs. Mayor Vico,"Why do we have to drag a good& hardworking politician just to praise another good politician? Can we not celebrate them both instead why the need to pit the good ones? I mean there's actually a swamp of polpolitiko out there, so instead of comparing these 2 eh why not focus your energy or hatreds towards those polpolitikos! I just notice lang ha na everytime mayor joy does something good, some toxic twitter kakampink never fail to drag mayor vico as if good governance is a competition.

That's why we only have few of them (the good ones) in politics kasi instead of dragging the bad one eh naka focus iba sa pag slander dun sa mabuti. I think there's no need din to downplay his achievements para lang maiangat yung isa. Kasi I know for a fact na di lang dahil pogi siya kaya well love & popular si vico. His projects resonates more to the people(his anti corruption drive, zero-billing policy sa mga hospital sa pasig, partnering w/ bayo to empower women victims of domestic violence, malusog na batang pasigueñeo, all his initiatives for education, free dialysis for pasigueñeo w/ their very own mega dialysis center & all his initiatives for health care, his relentless pursue in introducing & reviving pasig history for the next generation in fact bumuo sya ng team just to look for the ""Doña Geronima cave""). He's great in messaging din, idk if he has social media manager pero magaling siya magsulat ng captions sa mga post niya. He talks really well din, he's very articulate & eloquent w/o sounding ""elite"" bonus na lang siguro yung face value. 

Context: I've been seeing vico slander & his name always being mention everytime mayor joy does something good. Specifically a tweet from an hypocrite OP today downplays vico's achievements into just bcoz he's ""pogi"". But his past tweets shows that he was once a vico simp.

State Terrorism/State Violence,"Dahil naipasa yung Anti-Terrorism Act. Gusto ko lang ibahagi ang tinatawag State Terrorism/State Violence. Ang alam lang natin o nung iba ang kapag kalaban ka ng gobyerno ay isa kang terrorista. Terrorism according to FBI has 2 category:

International terrorism﻿: Violent, criminal acts committed by individuals and/or groups who are inspired by, or associated with, designated foreign terrorist organizations or nations (state-sponsored).

Domestic terrorism: Violent, criminal acts committed by individuals and/or groups to further ideological goals stemming from domestic influences, such as those of a political, religious, social, racial, or environmental nature.

Pero mayroon ding tinatawag na 

[State Terrorism](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264715825_State_Violence_as_State_Terrorism)- A  defining  feature  of  state  terrorism,  and  that  which  distinguishes  it  from  other forms  of  state  violence,  is  that  it  involves  the  illegal  targeting  of  individuals  that  the  state  has a  duty  to  protect  with  the  aim  of  instilling  fear  in  a  target  audience  beyond  the  direct  victim. 

Pero ito ay legitimate because of the law. 

""It  shows  that  any  monopoly  of  violence  that  the  state  claims  is  neither  a justification  for  excluding  state  terrorism  from  studies  of  terrorism,  and  nor,  more importantly,  for  affording  states  the  right  to  use  violence  in  any  way  they  choose."" 

Up to now State Terrorism is debatable . 

Pero masasabi ko  walang pinagkaiba ang mga Terroristang kinikilala ng Estado sa Estado natin mismo. 

Kung ang mga Terrorista ay lumalabag sa batas, ganun din naman yung estado.
Kung ang mga Terrorista ay pumapatay ng mga mamayan ganun din naman yung estado.
Kung ang Terrorista ay nagbibigay takot sa publiko ganun din ang estado.

Hindi natin kailangan ng bagong Anti-Terrorism Act kasi mismong Estado ang nagbibigay takot at pangamba sa kapakanan nating mga pilipino.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/gt6g0d/state_terrorismstate_violence/,t2_6b78qjka,30/05/2020 10:30,7

Why are Koreans racist to filipinos? observation from a Korean guy.,"In my first(and last) [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/qko2z3/i_am_korean_who_have_been_visiting_the/) on this sub, I was quite surprised to see many of the comments being quite racism-oriented.  It seems like the assumption of racism against filipinos in Korea is quite prevalent in PH, and I guess the #cancelkorea movement that took place last year also has something to do with it as well. I find it interesting but feel quite apprehensive about the misinformations. So I would like to briefly write about the racism as a whole. It is going to revolve mostly around history.

I am not going to use the word ""filipino"" nor specify Philippines, as most Koreans do not see difference between SE asians. Hence, I am going to use the term ""SE asians"" here.

Disclaimer 1: the term does not apply to Singaporeans, as the vast majority of the population is ethnic Chinese. Most Koreans consider them East Asians.

Disclaimer 2: this will contain a lots of generalisations, but as it is the nature of the ""observation"" type of writings, I find it inevitable to make one in order to proceed writing about it.

&#x200B;

1. Yes, there are racism in Korea. Most of it towards SEA and Chinese.

We are very homogenous country, which means xenophobia itself is deeply rooted in our culture.

We were one of the latest country to adopt western science and ideology in Asia, and it is due to the fact that our royalties believed Japanese and western cultures were inherently inferior and primitive in comparison to Chinese one, which we had been historically looked up to for centuries. Our elites continued to retain the belief and it eventually made their empire crumble. Then, after years of poverty and struggle, one of the ""barbaric westerners(the bald eagle)"" came here and installed their political and economic system, and that was how the current ""Republic of Korea"" was established. Although our condescension towards the west came to the end after the harsh lesson, our inherent tendency to look down on those ""inferior than us"" never really was terminated. As the Chinese dominance in East Asian cultural sphere ends, we started to treat Chinese people as below us, although we have been idolising them for the last 10 centuries at least. We look up to those who we think are above us, and disregard these who we think are below us. This is due to the historical importance of hierarchy in Korean history, and also one of the reasons why Korean society is very hierarchy-orientated until today.

&#x200B;

2. The reason why we look down on SE asians has nothing to do with skin colour per se.

The reason why so many Koreans look down on SE asians is all about the repeated economical failure in the ASEAN region in recent history. Koreans in general see nothing to learn from the region in terms of prosperity, and this is also why many Korean elderly call filipinos ""lazy"" and ""dumb"". In their mind, the region's continuing economic misfortune only makes sense if the people are inherently idle.

This many be surprise many of you, but those of us who are racists to SE asians, quite often are very hospitable to SEA-americans. This logic is going to confuse many of you but the same Koreans does not count them as below us as soon as they hear that etherial American accent coming out of their mouth, which makes them immune from all the prejudices somehow. I have seen this happening in real time countlessly while teaching Korean and exchange students, that I am quite sure this is universal sentiment.

The same logic applies in Japan as well. I have seen few cases while travelling Japan, where SE asians were being discriminated in restaurants by the server when they enter, but as soon as the server catch American accent the treatment changed upside down.  So my assumption is that, it works the same in China as well, which makes it East Asian thing, rather than Korean thing.

&#x200B;

3. No, it does not matter whether you are rich.

As I have described above, the discrimination is very economy-oriented. And this is why I am certain the discrimination will end as soon as the general economy in the region surpass Korea. So, this may brings the question: Am I still subject to discrimination even if I am rich? Yes, yes you are.

it is your nationality what matters for East Asians in general. If you are from third world, you are poor. If you are from first world, you are rich. It does not matter if you are filipino billionaire or Homeless Viet-american, nationality functions as the sole indicator of your status. I am realising how exactly dumb this logic is as I am writing, but that is the way it is here.

&#x200B;

4. Millenials and Gen Zs know better

When the covid-related violence against asian-americans dominated headline in korean media last year, I was utterly shocked to see most of the top Knets comments pointing out our hypocrisy of crying over racism against East Asians in the west, when we discriminate SE asians ourselves. I did not even know so many of us were conscious of our racist tendency towards SEA. Although I still hear many of my friends making disappointing remarks against SE asians, just seeing those comments On the internet being some of the most liked gave me some hope in a way. The sentiment is changing rapidly, and gradually more and more of us sees problem in it. I am positive that this distorted belief does not have long to live. Gen Zs really could end racism.

&#x200B;

5....However

Still, I have found that even those progressives hesitate to actually date people from the region. The social status matters a lot in the Korean society, and dating people from the region make people likely to think less of you in Korean society. For many of us, the only reason one marry people from the region is because they are too unattractive find one domestically. Most of ""mail-ordered brides"" of old farmers in Korea coming from SEA does not help either, so I have to say the chance of finding your Oppa or Nuna in Korea is pretty thin.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I tried to write as bluntly as possible, while getting the least defensive of Korea as I can get. I really love my country and found loads of good things in it. However, I am aware that turning a blind eye to the deeply rooted toxicities in our society does not help the future prospect of my country. There are loads of toxicity in it, and I want to share my opinion on it in a plain-spoken and objective way within my capability, with both my fellow Koreans and those abroad.

As I have said in my AMA, the Philippines is one of my favourite places on earth, and filipinos are one of the most hospitable, hard working people I know. None of the racism I have addressed here are mine, and I firmly believe every sorts of racism could come to end within my generation, with all the like-minded youngsters come together to fight against it:) We have good shot, believe me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/qneex8/why_are_koreans_racist_to_filipinos_observation/,t2_4cy0h8c0,06/11/2021 0:08,988
Marriage and Family,"Minalang, Azizah M.   (BSSW - 2)  Gender and Society

(For academic purposes only)

1.) Only non-Muslim women from the People of the Book are allowed to marry Muslim men. Even if the men are from the People of the Book, Muslim women are not permitted to marry non-Muslim men.

Despite the fact that Muslim men can marry non-Muslim women from the People of the Book, there are restrictions on which types of People of the Book can be married.

When a man and a woman marry, Muslim scholars claim that the wife will live with the husband in a home.

When a Muslim man marries a non-Muslim woman from the People of the Book, the non-Muslim woman from the People of the Book is free to practice her religion as she sees fit, whether it be according to Moses' or Jesus' teachings, without accepting Prophet Muhammad's teachings. The Muslim husband cannot compel his non-Muslim wife to recognize and obey Prophet Muhammad's teachings.

If a Muslim woman marries a non-Muslim man from the People of the Book, the non-Muslim man (People of the Book) may refuse to allow his Muslim wife to freely practice Prophet Muhammad's teachings.

That is why, even if the non-Muslim men are from the People of the Book, Islam forbids Muslim women from marrying non-Muslim men.

2.)Divorce occurs only when one partner feels that being divorced is preferable to being married. The reasons for being happy after divorce will vary depending on the relationship. As a result, the benefits of getting divorced vary depending on the sort of relationship you had. However, here are some of the most common benefits of having a divorce:

When a couple is unhappy in their marriage, they file for divorce. There are a variety of reasons why people are unhappy, including domestic violence, financial difficulties, incompatibility, loss of rights, and so on. Being divorced eliminates both of these sources of dissatisfaction. Someone may have tried and failed to make their relationship work. In that scenario, divorce is the only viable choice.

You have the ability to plan your financial position based on your personal preferences. This means you have complete control of how you spend, save, and invest your hard-earned money. When we get divorced, you'll have financial independence. This ensures you are not under any obligation to work overtime to meet your family's needs, even though you already make enough money.

Divorce is commonly considered to be very painful for children. However, dealing with parents who simply despise each other may be more difficult in some situations. Growing up in a home where their parents are constantly fighting is a toxic atmosphere for a child. In this situation, the child may have separate relationships with both parents without the tension between them interfering with both. This also means they will no longer have to watch their parents fight after the divorce. Children who grow up in a home where fights and disputes are normal are more likely to become aggressive as adults.

3.) A single parent is like a one-man army, responsible for everything from good parenting to the well-being of their children. For a single working mom, there is no time to relax. Single parents also have no choice but to work extra hours in order to provide for their children. As a result, juggling professional obligations and parental duties is a big challenge for a single parent.

4.) We used to refer to family as ""socially recognized.""

According to sociologist, it is an intimate domestic community since it is made up of individuals who are related by blood. They are people who gather only to carry out their roles as members of one of society's most basic units. They've exchanged emotional feelings and have a tendency to stick together; they assist one another in building strong wheels for their community, and they provide advice to one another. They've shared issues, and no matter what happens, they'll be there for you because they're your family. They are the ones who want to spend time with you, even though they are not connected to you.

"To the people wondering why atheists have a problem with the idea of hell, please take your time to read this","""Some theists express confusion about why atheists have a problem with the idea of hell when we don't even believe it exists. To those theists, I ask a simple question: 'Do I deserve eternal torture?'

Those who answer 'Yes' make my point for me. *Their belief has dehumanised me to the point that they can tell me - without shame - that they support a system that consigns me to unending suffering.* Not for committing some genocidal atrocity, not for harming a single person, but for the crime of not believing in something for which I had no evidence.

Those who evade my question also illustrate my point. 

The first of two common evasions is: 'It's not up to me.' This is disingenuous redundancy. Folks who respond this way know full well that's not the question I'm asking. But I'll walk them through the long version anyway:

*'I'm a non-believer. According to your god, non-believers deserve eternal torture. Do you agree with your god that I deserve eternal torture?'*

More often than not, I'll get exactly the same politician's response. These folks are stuck between defending the indefensible - hell - and questioning the unquestionable - their god. And it's not always realistic to expect a swift resolution to that kind of internal conflict. But for me, it's a promising sign that there is at least some internal conflict. It shows me there's some appropriate discomfort about this vile concept. It also means they haven't yet rationalised the problem of hell. They haven't invested in a fallacious justification. This leaves room to hope that their internal conflict will inspire further private reflection.

The other common evasion is: 'You send yourself to hell.'

This is a very different kind of evasion. Here, the problem of hell has ben rationalised. Removing responsibility from the god in question and placing it on the non-believer. This is known as blaming the victim and it's a well-known distancing maneuver employed by abusers andntheir conspirers. After they've beaten their spouses, instigators of domestic violence deny responsibility for their actions by complaining: 'Look what you made me do!'

In the novel 'Sophie's Choice.' The eponymous character, a Holocaust survivor, is forced by a sadistic doctor at Auschwitz to decide the fate of her two children. One will be gassed, the other will be allowed to live. When she fails to choose, she's told they'll both be gassed. In a moment of panic, Sophie chooses and is tormented by guilt for the rest of her days. But she's utterly blameless. The doctor was entirely responsible, forcing her into a grotesque position. Non-believers don't send themselves to eternal torture, that's the rationalisation of the sadist.

*All of these responses show why atheists have a problem with hell even though we believe it don't exists. It's because it dehumanises us.* One of the first things done to groups who are targeted for discrimination is that their human status is stripped of them. They might be described explicitly as subhuman, or as animals, or insects. Rats, monkeys, cockroaches. If you view people as cockcroaches, how are you likely to treat them? What about when you downgrade people to kindling?

**When you reduce people to hell-fodder, it's remarkable how low you can go.** Which is why it's especially important to attack beliefs that dehumanise. 

My impression is that most theists have a great discomfort about the whole 'sending non-believers to hell' concept. Many Christians I've spoken to flat-out deny the existence of hell, asserting that their god simply wouldn't allow such an abomination. Others have cheerfully consoled me with their view that non-believers just die. That's it. No eternal punishment.

Well, I'm not one to look a gift horse in the mouth, but I do have to ask: where are they getting this information? Certainly not from Matthew ch. 25  which refers explicitly to eternal punishment. 

Sometimes I'm genuinely touched by the obvious positive intentions of theists who distort their ideology in all kinds of ways in order to reach out their hands in brotherhood and sisterhood. Some Christians go as far as declaring that a belief in their god is non-essential - all that matters is how we treat each other.

*But we have to acknowledge that this is exactly the kind of thinking that got us into this hellish mess in the first place:* **making up whatever we want to believe**""

The Philippines is expecting World War 3,"When I wake this morning, I became immediately worried for a reason did I ate my dinner last night. Fortunately, I ate my dinner last night. But afterward, my worry was quickly changed from eating my dinner last night to the issue of the possibility of World War 3. I am not really on twitter, I barely open my account, so I have no idea at all what are the trending topics on it. I barely open my facebook account also nowadays, but I don't know why I open it this early morning, and the first post I saw that caught my attention was this post, a screenshot from twitter.

I find this kind of post quite irresponsible. This kind of discussion is unreliable in a sense because it only spread fears among the population, and has no basis on what's happening and had already happened. The possibility of World War 3 is always on the horizon, but many factors should be considered first in order before the possibility of it should cross our mind. The most critical factor is a direct attack of superpower, military and economic, to another superpower. The superpowers are the USA, EU, China, Russia, and Japan. 

China will unlikely be involved because their immediate concern is their domestic problems - the trade-war between them and the USA, and to contain the instability and violence in Hong Kong. Additionally, as the mediator between the trade war of Japan and South Korea. China is unlikely to enter a third war in this kind of domestic situation. Remember, the power of their government doesn't come from the popular vote but rather from the economic stability and growth they can give to their people. And entering war means economic disaster and cutting trade to the other countries; the majority of the largest economies are allies of the US. 

EU countries are also in a weak position for a world war. The UK still in the Brexit problem, Macron of France is facing various opposition and difficulties in his government, Germany is facing slow economic growth. 

Japan's constitution doesn't allow its government to enter a war against other nations unless to protect themselves. And Japan is unlikely to be a target of Iran's attack because of the vast distance between them.

Russia is a military superpower, but its capability and resources are limited or concentrated only to defend their country from aggression from other nations. This means they do not have the resources to enter war between them and the USA, who have far more resources and budget compared to them. This is evident in their 2018 confrontation between them and the USA, France, and the UK in Seria, wherein Russia only released a significantly lower number of defense missiles expected against the coalition. The USA concluded from the incident that Russia, although they defended their allies, doesn't want to risk depleting its resources militarily, which weakens their position to protect themselves domestically.  If there would be a war between Russia and the USA, a declaration of direct war against each other is unlikely, but instead, they would choose to have a proxy war against each other - the same they did in the cold war.

Now we need to come back and understand the Middle East region. For a long period already, the region is not stable. It has failing states and civil wars among its nations, due to two countries, Saudi Arabia and Iran, which compete for the influence in the region. This bitter two rivals in the area support the civil wars and small militia surrounding their country to push their political objectives but never declare a direct war against each other. Saudi Arabia is the superpower of the region compared to other nations in the area in whatever metric. Iran's power in the region lies only on its influence to its allies in the area and not necessarily militarily.  Their military power is useful in number only but poorly equipped due to sanction imposed on them by the USA and its allies. Even Israel itself, a US ally, has far more sophisticated military technology and capability compared to Iran. 

If this was the case for Iran, what is the most likely to happens next or consequences of the recent killing of Iran's general?  World War 3 is not unlikely to happen because such war needs support from the superpower. Russia and China will never support any attack of Iran to any superpower unless it is the USA. Russia will leave Iran alone if ever it chooses to attack any other superpower (NATO) other than the USA. The USA will do everything to protect any attack on its soil coming from Iran. Its military bases in the Middle East and its allies, with far more superior technology, in the region will shut down immediately all the offense before it even leaves the region. The USA is on the other side of the Pacific; they are untouchable strategically. The worst consequences or implications coming from this incident is concerning the stability and peace in the region. Following the event, the turmoil and fraction in the Middle East come into a new height, and peace among the nations in the middle east will move farther on the horizon.

Many people on the internet were drawing parallelism between what happens to General Qassem Soleimani and Archduke Franz Ferdinand, which resulted in World War 1 and eventually World War 2. Yes, the catalyst of World War 1 is indeed an assassination, but the people drawing the connection from history to predict World War 3 forget to factor in or forget to put something on the table that is significant in the discussion. They forget that the superpower learned after World War 2 never to touch directly each other's backyard again, but instead, they will choose to engage in a proxy war against each other superpower, without declaring war, to push their agenda and influence across the globe. This is why the term ""Cold War"" is invented, and why the Korean War, Vietnam War, Syrian War happened, etc.

Now, if we are convinced that World War 3 is unlikely to happen, thus the Philippines should not be concerned anymore? No, most likely, its implication for the Philippines and to the rest of the world is a worldwide economic recession. The majority of the oil supply of the world comes from the middle east, and any additional instability in the region will result in a drastic shortage of oil supply in the global market. We hope that the retaliation Iran is talking about is not a direct attack on the oil depot or oil centers of the oil-producing countries allied to the US. The only practical attack for Iran to hurt the US is to sabotage its economy and its allies by creating a shortage of oil supply in the world market. Without enough oil, the world economy will stop to grow, and all the goods we need will have a higher cost, and eventually, the world will enter into a new recession.

The consequence of the killing of General Qassem Soleimani is unlikely to result in World War 3, but instead, it will more likely cause a global recession, and the Philippines will significantly be affected by it. Given the US-China trade war, Japan-Korea Trade War, Brexit, Hong Kong uncertainty, the German economy is slowing down, inequality is rising, ..., etc, and recently the supply of oil is at stake and in danger between the recent conflict of US and Iran - the world is nearing to complete its recipe for a global recession.

Teddy Locsin's interview with ANC regarding the UN,"[Twitter thread starts here](https://twitter.com/ANCALERTS/status/932572382908133376)

> DFA Sec. Cayetano led a move to push for humanitarian response to what's happening in Myanmar. If we don't speak up on the humanitarian issue, the UN will just forget about the ASEAN, and you don't want to be out of the ballgame.

> Locsin on the OIC resolution: Interference in the domestic problems of states will never be allowed; all the authorities say non-intervention in gov't affairs. I will do my best to argue for abstention. Our basic argument is we have to keep the ASEAN together; you are addressing the non-Muslims of ASEAN, and the Muslim constituents. If we had voted yes, we would've lost ASEAN; even on the things that should be easy, like the declaration of a nuclear-free zone, we didn't uphold it unanimously this year. If we had voted yes, we would've been responsible in the dissolution of ASEAN.

> Locsin on ASEAN-UN Summit: If anyone has the right to raise human rights issues, it's the UN. The Muslim states are very strong, but Suu Kyi held her own with great dignity. Suu Kyi really earned the Nobel Peace Prize more than anyone I could think of. She stood up to the army; she deserved the Nobel, and she had no support from anyone. Suu Kyi is all alone, and she got this far; military command remains with the army, and I think it will remain that way for the foreseeable future.

> The Rohingya crisis is definitely a crime against humanity; the question is whether ASEAN will call it that. We should not turn a blind eye; what we can do as ASEAN is to offer humanitarian aid, but the army said no.

> It is because of the UN that America is not fighting every country in the world. Without that, war will break out everywhere, and weak countries like us need the protection of the UN. The problem with the louder voices in the UN is when you go with their agenda, they're loud, but when it's your problem, wala.

> Trump is not against the UN; he just wants more bang for the buck.

----

Opinion:

* Advocating for ""non-intervention in domestic issues"" is consistent with what the administration wants. *He's projecting something that he wishes everyone else would practice with regards to our own domestic issues and our own concerns with human rights abuses*.
* He's using very guarded language with regards to Myanmar, focusing on the humanitarian issue and running interference for Aung San Suu Kyi. It's almost like the only problem is the care and feeding and housing of the Rohingya as refugees, without regard for **why** there is a crisis to begin with.
* That last line regarding Trump's views on the UN is straight out of Trump's own statements. He views the UN (and NATO) as a sort of ""protection racket"": *nations pay up, and in turn the group protects everyone from everyone-else*. The ""bang for the buck"" remark is in line with *recent calls for member states to increase defense spending* so it's ""not just the US paying for it"". The problem with this approach is two-fold: it decreases the incentive for the members of the group to honor the alliance *if it is reduced to a monetary transaction*, and hand-wringing over the costs of ""maintaining world peace"" disregards the role that member states have played in *causing* violence in the first place, as with every UN sanctioned (and unsanctioned) intervention.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/7e8irr/teddy_locsins_interview_with_anc_regarding_the_un/,t2_bkphq,20/11/2017 20:26,3
BBM's first 100 days (Long read),"Q: How would you grade the first 100 days of Pres Marcos?

A: I would do what I've done with every president.

First, I will ask what did he inherit from his predecessor? 
Then I will compare what he has done   in his first 100 with his inheritance to what his predecessor did with his in his first 100 days.

The first 100 are first steps in a six year journey so they are merely an indicator of where the president will be taking us - up a hill or over a cliff? 

There will be course corrections (or maybe none) as the journey moves forward or backward as the case may be. That's why I believe the first 100 is a mere indicator of where the president might take us. 

Having said that, let me share what I felt during the first 100 days of previous presidents starting with GMA. (I was living abroad during the entire term of Cory and the first 2 years of FVR so I can't compare FVR's first 100 to Cory's nor Erap's first 100 to FVR's.) 

GMA's first 100 made me happy and relieved and her second first 100 in 2004 made me feel the exact opposite.

But looking back, I've realized the alternative in 2004  would have been a first 100 for FPJ who made movies difficult to watch for even 100 seconds. And after she took her oath in 2004, her successor would have been Noli de Castro. In short, the alternatives could have been really disastrous.  

PNoy gave me the same happiness and relief I felt during GMA's original first 100 and for the most part that feeling stayed with me for  six years. There were a few disappointments here and there, nobody's perfect, but overall he didn't make me feel let down. My optimism remained high all throughout his presidency.  

Duterte's first 100 were unbearable  and so were the rest of his remaining 2090 days as President. Bloody corpses in depressed areas, embarrassing and cringey appearances on both world and domestic stages, corruption so unbridled that not even a pandemic could slow it down,  total destruction of  institutions of checks and balance vital for the survival of democracy and the rule of law. And I'm just getting started so let's leave it at that.

And now Pres BBM.
 First I'll be honest. I was very disappointed Leni lost and fearful BBM would become another Duterte. But it is what it is so let's move on and  compare his first 100 to Duterte's first 100.  

Pres BBM made some good appointments and some awful ones - Calida (glad he didn't last 100 days), Enrile, Bersamin, and Sara to name the worst choices for vital positions. And he also neglected a vital appointment. Up to now, he has not appointed a Health Secretary despite his having extended the Covid public health emergency until December. 

He radically departed from Duterte on matters most important to Duterte: 

1) he met with Biden to recalibrate our bilateral relations and by so doing tempered Duterte's fevered romance with Xi Jin Ping, 
2) he shared a well thought out reservation about bringing back the death penalty, and, in the greatest departure of all, 
3) announced a drug war policy that would focus on stemming supply i.e. go after big time drug smugglers and dealers instead of the little guys whose corpses Duterte loved to use as props for his war on drugs. Further he will focus on educating the youth on the dangers of drug abuse and he will undertake the rehabilitation of addicts. (Similar to Leni's humane approach on drugs) 

So, barring any course corrections, his war on drugs will definitely be humane and rational compared to his predecessor's which was barbaric and insane.  I fully  support BBM's position on the death penalty and the war on drugs. 

There are  opportunities he must not let pass in the coming 2090 days, opportunities that will allow history to judge him on his own merits rather than as Marcos Junior:

 1) the assassination of radio commentator Lapid must be solved with both the assassins and mastermind(s) brought to justice asap. 
One does not have to ennumerate what bringing those involved in that murder will do to put meat on his pronouncements regarding his commitment to human rights, press freedom, the rule of law and his abhorrence for violence and criminality. 

Related to this would be strengthening the Commission on Human Rights with legislation and certifying as urgent the enactment of the Freedom of Information bill.

2) he must appoint the right person to  chair the COA. That will correct the bad impression created when he appointed Calida, a Duterte stooge who raised eyebrows in COA over contracts his family-owned security agency entered into with several govt agencies including Congress while he was SolGen. 

Pres BBM must appoint a COA chair who will lay to rest any doubts about his stated commitment to clean and honest governance. Related to appointing an uncompromising COA chair, the successful prosecution of crooked govt officials will happen only if Ombudsman Samuel Martires is replaced.  Martires can only be removed through impeachment but he can be persuaded to resign. 

Pres BBM must also certify as urgent those necessary amendments to the Bank Secrecy Law and amendments that will make the anti-money laundering agency more effective.

3) set the example for other branches of gov't,  i.e. Congress, Judiciary, and Constitutional  bodies by issuing an order mandating that all SALNs of Executive Branch employees be posted online.

Goverment works best when given the right working conditions. As VP Leni never tired of reminding us, ""Sa gobyernong tapat, aangat tayong lahat.""
🙂

Finally, beware of optics in a society that suffers from a huge wealth disparity. PNoy was attacked by his own dilawans when he bought a used Porsche with his own money. He ended up having to sell it immediately.

 One does not have to sleep under a kulambo, eat with his hands in a carenderia, and wear a kamiseta although it will be good to keep in mind that those antics produced a net satisfaction rating of 81% for one president.🤣🤣",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/xwyki7/bbms_first_100_days_long_read/,t2_b84nidav,06/10/2022 14:51,10

Two Essays on Retiring in the Philippines (long read),"TRAPPED BETWEEN CULTURES: Neither Filipino Nor American
Eugenio Amparo, MD


I was born in the Philippines to Filipino parents but I have lived continuously in America since 1974, the year I started my diagnostic radiology residency at the University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas. Now, having retired from the practice of medicine, I find myself with too much time to contemplate everything from quantum mechanics, the existence of God in a fundamentally random universe seemingly full of suffering, to the history of the bra and the deforestation of pubic hair. One of these contemplations led to an uncomfortable conclusion, that I am neither Filipino nor American, that I am trapped between cultures.

As a child in Iloilo City, I used to dream of America with rivers of cars, supermarkets overflowing with food, snow in the winter, everything I saw in movies. Now, I have a BMW and a Mercedes Benz in a three-car garage; a refrigerator full of food as well as obesity and hypercholesterolemia; pictures from family ski trips to Aspen, Vail, Squaw Valley; and a loneliness that is as American as apple pie. I miss the Philippines.

When I visit the Philippines to see friends and relatives, I envy their close family and friendship ties, which is not just an artifact of my visit and a testament to their hospitality. Even when I'm not there, my first cousins, who live in different cities in Metro Manila, get together every Sunday for lunch in Quezon City. By contrast, I can count on the fingers of one hand the number of times I got together in the past ten years with my younger brother in Virginia and my sister in Oregon. My daughter lives in San Francisco, a two-hour drive from our home in Sacramento but we see her once or twice every two months. My son and grandchildren live in Folsom, a twenty-minute drive away, but we all have to make a conscious effort to get together once a week. Americans are just too busy, which is the reason America is the greatest economic power in the world and the reason Americans are one of the loneliest people in the world with a very high prevalence of depression. I am not American enough to resign myself to loneliness as a consequence of a national obsession with rugged individualism and self sufficiency.
------------------------
I am not American enough to resign myself to loneliness…
------------------------

The solution seems simple; I retire in the Philippines. But then I remember that it now takes almost as long to drive from the University of the Philippines in Quezon City to the Philippine General Hospital, a distance of 11 miles, as it takes to drive from Sacramento to San Francisco, a distance of 87 miles. That's because Manila traffic is so gridlocked. I'm no longer Filipino enough to be patient with Manila traffic.

In America, I bank online and I get cash from ATMs. In the Philippines people still go to banks just to conduct business that can be conducted online or at ATMs. Dealing with government bureaucracies in America like the Department of Motor Vehicles or the Internal Revenue Service can be frustrating, but
at least it can be done without having to bribe anyone, whereas the simplest business dealings in the Philippines may require bribes. I still remember a time when visiting the Philippines from America required knowledge of how to bribe customs officials upon arrival at the airport. I once arrived at the Manila International Airport and declared all my scuba gear equipment. The customs officials at first
salivated at the thought of how much money they would make from me and then realized I was a hopeless case and finally waved me through. They figured no idiot would declare all of that and know
how to bribe his way through, so no bribes were forthcoming. Our medical school alumni association in America once sent a cargo container full of supplies for donation to the Philippine General Hospital (PGH). It was confiscated by customs and it was not released to the PGH until several politicians had intervened. I would not be surprised if it also required bribes to customs officials. Airport customs has vastly improved, probably to encourage tourism and visits from “balikbayans,” but I'm told that conducting business in the Philippines still routinely involves bribery.

When I sit poolside at the Manila Polo Club I think the Club may be the ultimate blend of American and Filipino: clean and well organized; efficient and courteous service; a feeling of Filipino closeness as well as American aloofness. Then I remember that the Manila Polo Club is an exclusive enclave. It is not the Philippines, which brings me to yet another glaring problem. I am no longer Filipino enough to ignore the yawning chasm between rich and poor in the Philippines. A few minutes drive from the Manila Polo Club with its Benzes and BMWs, street children run up to cars and beg for coins. You see tin and cardboard shanties where children live. If you are driving at night in the provinces, an unnerving darkness seems to swallow up the small villages you pass. I'm now too American to ignore all this, although I barely noticed it when I lived in the Philippines.

And I have become too soft in America. I find myself sweating profusely when I visit the humid Philippines because Sacramento is so dry sweat evaporates even when the temperature approaches 100 degrees F. I no longer scoff at golfers in the Philippines hiring umbrella girls to protect them from the sun, although I suspect that is not the only reason umbrella girls populate Filipino golf courses. As a child in the Philippines, I was so dirty I had to be periodically dewormed. Now, I seem germophobic when I visit the Philippines. I also get traveler's diarrhea every time I visit so I have to watch what I eat. My stomach has become too American but I still long for bamboo shoots, hearts of palm, dinuguan, lechon, and talaba. This part is likely just a matter of acclimatization.

What isn't a matter of acclimatization is my feeling of anxiety in the Philippines regarding emergency services. In America I have been lulled into the feeling that I can always call 911 for police, firemen or paramedics and they will come in time and I can trust them. Past emergencies in America have taught me that this is generally true. I don't feel that way in the Philippines. I see armed guards everywhere in the Philippines, outside gated communities, in bank lobbies, and even in a noodle restaurant. It seems that no one really expects the police to be of any help against criminals. I don't see how an ambulance can possibly make it through Manila traffic and I remember being a clinical clerk in the emergency room of the Philippine General Hospital (PGH). I would fear for my life if I were brought there, although I'm told much has improved at the PGH.
-------------------------
I am no longer Filipinos enough to be patient with gridlocked Manila traffic….
-------------------------
I have lived so long in America, a developed country, that I have grown accustomed to efficiency and punctuality, reliable emergency services, above board business dealings, and the abundance of creature comforts. As a consequence, I am no longer Filipino enough to be patient with gridlocked Manila traffic, to take my chances with unreliable emergency services, to conduct business that may require bribery, and to get used to the discomforts and the visible poverty of a developing country. Yet, I am also too Filipino to ignore the aching loneliness of the American way of life, too Filipino not to envy the close family and friendship ties I see when I visit the Philippines. I am trapped between cultures, neither Filipino nor American.

This article was written by a Filipino-American serviceman who was planning to retire in his native land after completing his US military service, but changed his mind.  Are his reasons not to retire in the Philippines valid? 
 
Why I Won’t Live in the Philippines Anymore

I’ll be 42 this year, it’ll be quite a while before I retire. But sometimes the topic of where to retire comes up in conversations when I’m with older friends, or among my peers who are in the military & will retire after they fulfill their 20 years of active duty service. Most of the Filipinos I talk to say that they’d retire in the US, not in the Philippines. I ask them why, considering that because of the favorable exchange rate, they could retire comfortably in the Philippines. We have some common answers, which I’ll elaborate on below.

Now before I go further, let me say that the US is not perfect, no country is. But in spite of its flaws, I’d rather live here. I cannot speak for my friends, but here are the reasons why I no longer want to live in the Philippines & prefer instead to live & retire here in the USA:

Bangko ng bayan – If you retire in the Philippines, some of your relatives, friends, even neighbors will come and ‘borrow’ or ask money from you. There’s always some sort of medical emergency going on or a child who needs tuition money. They will approach you too if they need money for a birthday party, baptism, wedding or burial. If you say no, ikaw pang masama. And don’t expect them to repay you if you do lend money.

Security issues – I think no matter how simple you live, word will get around that you’re receiving some sort of retirement income from the US or abroad. You could become an easy target of ‘akyat-bahay’ gangs or kidnappings, either by strangers or by disgruntled people you didn’t lend money to.

No 911 or emergency services – unlike here in the US where you can call 911 and an ambulance will be there in a few minutes, in the Philippines, no such emergency service exists. Even if there were, with the traffic in large metropolitan areas like Manila, by the time the ambulance does reach you and transport you to the hospital, you’d probably be dead or close to death by then. And if you don’t have any health insurance, I doubt you’ll be taken care of.

Corruption – things happen faster if you bribe people. I clearly remember hearing that it takes years for people to get a phone line, but the process could be speeded up if you knew someone at the phone company. Those who have drivers licenses, what’s the percentage that they actually took both a written & practical driving test? At almost every contact I had with the government, things were slow & people would ‘offer’ to speed things up for me if I paid a little extra, which I refused.

Pollution – during my last year in the Philippines, I would get a sore throat every 6 weeks or so from the dirty air I was exposed to while riding tricycles & jeepneys. It was so bad that I had barely any voice left, and my voice was needed because I constantly spoke with people at work. Except for the tourist spots & business districts, most areas you went there was trash on the streets. It’s a common sight for people to just throw candy wrappers anywhere, further clogging the drains which contributes to the floods whenever it rains in Manila There are no trash cans or dumpsters to speak of. Some men will urinate at the nearest wall instead of looking for a public restroom. Signs like “bawal umihi dito” and “bawal magtapon ng basura dito” are ignored.

Traffic – what would normally take 15-20 minutes to navigate will take an hour or more because of the traffic. I do not want to deal with that. I remember when I was still working in the Philippines, I had co-workers who would leave home at 5:30 or 6 am & get to work just in time at 7:30 or 8:00 am. And rules of the road? I am embarrassed to say we have some of the most undisciplined drivers I’ve ever seen.

The laws are less female friendly

In the Philippines, if you have a child and your husband or boyfriend ran off with someone else or simply abandoned you & your child, sorry ka na lang. Here in the States, even if you’re not married to the guy, there are laws in place. He is legally, not to mention morally, obligated to support his child. You can take him to court for child support & since everything here in the US is connected to one’s social security number, if he’s working, he can be tracked down & his wages will be garnished (automatically deducted) from his paycheck & sent to you. If he stops working, once he does find work again, he now owes you back payments & he will legally have to pay that on top of whatever court ordered child support in place.

I don’t know how seriously domestic violence is treated in the Philippines, but here, if a guy merely pushes you, or even talks to you in a threatening or demeaning manner, you can call 911 on him for domestic abuse or violence. It will go on his record, & he could get into serious trouble especially if he’s in the US military.

I have many fond memories of the Philippines. I have many friends there that I keep in touch with via email, fb or skype, & I can see them when I visit. It is where I was born, & where I lived from the ages of 9-28. The Philippines will always be a nice place to visit, but it’s not where I want to live anymore. And unless a lot of things change for the better, I have no intentions of going back there to live.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/1w0zcw/two_essays_on_retiring_in_the_philippines_long/,t2_5ikx6,24/01/2014 20:02,14
"By Failing to Transform the Philippines, Liberals Paved the Way for the Reactionary Right","https://jacobin.com/2022/08/philippines-reactionary-right-ferdinand-marcos-jr-liberals-reform

> In 1986, President Corazon Aquino of the Philippines found herself facing a difficult dilemma. She had just been sworn in as head of a self-proclaimed “revolutionary” government following the success that year of the People Power Revolution, as the mass uprising which took down the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos Sr was dubbed. However, as Aquino prepared to work, she found that Marcos and his cronies had emptied the public coffers.

> Worse still, banking officials from Wall Street kept calling, demanding that her government pay back the US$27 billion they had lent the Philippines. A failure to comply would mean incurring huge losses for the country’s economic elite — of which Aquino herself was a part — as their access to credit would dry up and the value of their stocks would plummet.

> On the other hand, going along with the demands for payment would mean there was little left to spend on social welfare or employment generation as millions of Filipinos reeled from the deepest recession their country had experienced since World War II. Would Aquino stand up to the banks and refuse to pay — or would she cave in?

> It is helpful to look back today at this and other decisive junctures in the years that followed the ouster of the former dictator in the light of debates that are still raging after the victory of his son and namesake in the country’s presidential election this year.

> Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr was a candidate who refused to apologize for his father’s crimes, and who vowed to continue the brutal and vicious political agenda of his immediate predecessor Rodrigo Duterte. How did he manage to secure the largest share of the vote for any candidate since his father’s fall, taking almost 59 percent in a system that has no second-round runoff?

> Disconcerted by the election results, **some have explained Marcos Jr’s triumph as the upshot of a singularly effective “disinformation” drive aimed against the liberal opposition**. Others have blamed their own runner-up candidate, then incumbent vice president Leni Robredo, saying she lost because of her campaign’s “elitist” messaging or a failure to listen.

> These explanations have their merit, but they still leave us with bigger questions. **How did a clear majority of the electorate become so inclined to believe or disregard outright lies from Bongbong Marcos and his allies?** What are the circumstances under which massive advantages for one candidate or bad messaging deployed on behalf of another become decisive?

> To address these issues, we need to historicize the current moment in Philippine politics and focus on a certain group of actors kept out of view by many in the mainstream commentariat. In what follows, we will look at the record of Aquino and the many other liberals who have shaped the fates of millions of Filipinos over the past decades.

> The question of how to deal with the country’s debt was just one of the many dilemmas the post-dictatorship establishment confronted as they steered the state upon the restoration of what Benedict Anderson called **“cacique democracy”: a system in which everyone can vote but landed families effectively determine election outcomes through their patronage networks and control of the bureaucracy**. These various issues invariably touched upon a broader question that liberal reformists had long faced: How were they going to transform the Philippines into a more modern capitalist society?

> Before them stood two main paths. The first was the developmentalist road that pre-dictatorship administrations had initially taken but failed to pursue effectively and eventually chose to abandon. In this perspective, **those who made up the majority of the population (workers, peasants, etc.) were considered to be the main potential engines of the economy. If they were going to produce more wealth, the state needed to increase their purchasing power through a series of reforms: breaking up the country’s vast haciendas and giving them land, increasing their wages, ensuring job security, keeping the price of basic goods low, sparing them from taxes, and providing them with housing**.

> The national economy in this scenario would have to be strengthened from within, with the country’s industrial capacity built up by cultivating and controlling domestic capital and by nurturing the local market. The state would extract a bigger part of the social surplus from the rich and channel it toward productive investments that could trigger a virtuous cycle of higher employment, expanded consumption, and greater surplus. In line with this approach, the new government would repudiate the foreign debts that Marcos Sr had accumulated to improve levels of social provision and create more job opportunities.

> **The second option was the neoliberal road that Marcos Sr himself had begun to embark on** during his final years in office. **This framework considered the propertied classes to be the economy’s prime movers**. While neoliberal ideologues often spoke about “rolling back the frontiers of the state,” in practice, **the state would not withdraw so much as assume a different role. Its function would now be to help the country’s economic elites accumulate more wealth**.

> This would involve **concentrating land in the hands of bigger firms** (to achieve economies of scale) and **maintaining low wages and labor “flexibility.”** It would also mean handing over the **provision of basic services to the private sector, shifting the burden of taxation onto the shoulders of the poor, and curtailing the expansion of social provisions**.

> The path that the liberal successors of Marcos Sr would take was by no means predetermined. Corazon Aquino’s big-tent coalition included some relatively progressive officials in positions of influence who pushed for her to follow the first path. They were convinced that it was only by helping those at the bottom that more wealth would be generated and eventually flow upward. On the other hand, center-right figures, including former Marcos appointees, pushed back, sticking to their “trickle-down” agenda.

> Though much of the ensuing debate between these two warring liberal camps was couched in the technical language of economics, **the heart of the matter was ultimately political. After all, redistributing wealth downward would have required the state to enforce its monopoly over the legitimate use of violence against the country’s dominant class. This would have been essential if the government was going to strip big landowners of their vast landholdings, compel capitalists to raise wages, or restrain big business from jacking up its prices**.

> Redistributing wealth upward, in contrast, would require the state to use its coercive power against the popular classes in order to carry through regressive social measures. **It was ultimately a question of political choice: Whose side would the liberals take, and who would they choose to hurt?**

> Aquino initially tried to balance the interests of both sides, but eventually embraced the neoliberal path. **She chose to service the country’s debts unconditionally and in full**, including those of private borrowers. Soon after, **she purged her cabinet of progressives, dropping left-wing figures from top posts and replacing them with dyed-in-the-wool free marketeers**. In one representative move, **Aquino fired her pro-worker labor secretary and replaced him with the lawyer who represented the country’s largest group of employers**.

> In the years that followed, **Aquino stood aside as a landlord-dominated Congress passed a supposed “land reform” law that was so riddled with loopholes that it ended up advancing the interests of elites invested in agribusiness**, including Aquino’s own family. **She also kept a tight lid on wages**, promoted “labor flexibility,” and **used Marcos-era laws to crack down on unions**.

> Unwilling to increase taxes on the rich, **Aquino steered the country toward a more regressive tax system**. In the hope of attracting more investment and enabling Philippine companies to penetrate foreign markets, she also relaxed restrictions on capital flows and entered into free trade agreements with other countries. **It is telling that, as the years wore on, the president even stopped using the words “revolution” or “people power” in her public statements altogether**.

> After Aquino had completed her term, her handpicked successor, **Fidel Ramos**, a former national police chief under Marcos, ramped up the neoliberal transformation of the Philippine economy. **His government privatized and “re-regulated” the country’s biggest infrastructure, selling off such vital public services as water distribution and electricity transmission to some of the biggest conglomerates in the Philippines. Staffing his administration with more right-wing technocrats, Ramos also dramatically reduced tariffs and lifted regulatory constraints on big business**.

> The choices made by Aquino, Ramos, and the technocrats around them had profound effects on millions of people. By taking so many steps to restore “investor confidence,” they managed to draw in more capital and generate economic growth. As a result, **a narrow segment of the population moved up the social ladder** during this phase of externally driven economic expansion.

> This included an emergent layer of upstart big capitalists who were making their fortunes in real estate, retail, and other growth areas. Professionals hired by these capitalists and by transnational corporations also benefitted, as did white-collar workers employed in the booming “call center” industry. The salaries of civil servants went up as the state managed to increase revenues through regressive taxes.

> However, **by using state violence to help capital intensify its exploitation and dispossession of the masses, liberals in power also kept a much larger section of the population down. Tens of millions of workers saw their living standards drop between 1986 to 1997. Many others lost their jobs entirely as de-industrialization set in**. Hundreds of thousands of teachers, doctors, nurses, and others from the middle class found themselves worse off as their incomes stagnated and employment opportunities narrowed.

> **Many small farmers were impoverished as heavily subsidized goods from abroad flooded the local market. Countless shopkeepers had to shutter their businesses as chain stores sprouted across the country**. Hundreds of thousands of informalized settlers were evicted from their homes, and even salaried professionals groaned as the prices of water, electricity, gas, and basic commodities soared following the privatization of these sectors.

> **Economically struggling and politically disillusioned, millions of Filipinos began to look at the “People Power Revolution” in a harsher light**. From the mid-1990s onward, a tide of resentment slowly emerged among the lower classes. Many became more skeptical of the version of events promoted by liberals, before eventually turning their back on them. Indeed, **we can read much of Philippine history after 1997 as the story of the oppressed masses gradually turning against the post-Marcos order**, with various political forces either trying to defuse and deflect their hostility, or to channel it toward their own preferred resolutions.

> We can find multiple examples of this process of disillusionment with the liberal establishment, first among the lowest social classes and later among the middle strata. **The populist Joseph Estrada defeated the anointed successor of Fidel Ramos in 1998, and the urban poor launched a mass insurrection in 2001 to reinstate Estrada as president after his ouster earlier that year**. This was followed by Rodrigo Duterte’s election victory over the preferred candidate of the liberals, Mar Roxas, in 2016. As indignation spread, other members of the liberal establishment scrambled to appease mass discontent, while various “outsiders” tried to hijack it.

> Without more data on public opinion in the Philippines, it is difficult for us to reach definitive conclusions about why so many people from among the lower classes chose to rally behind yet another “outsider” in the May elections this year. However, it is impossible to imagine that the repeated use of force by liberals in power to advance the interests of capital — and the effects this had on people’s material conditions — had no bearing on that choice.

> Unlike conventional reactionary populists, **Marcos Jr took advantage of this tide of political sentiment by employing a seemingly anti-populist discourse of reconciliation that set him apart from his predecessor’s authoritarian-demagogue persona**. His strategy deployed recycled narratives of “unity” and distortions of history. Mobilizing this rhetoric while **casting himself as a victim of the post-dictatorship establishment** proved to be politically expedient for Marcos Jr, as **it shut down questions of accountability and made it unnecessary to run on a clear policy platform**.

> Bongbong’s political message focused on a call for reparations to deal with the failures of the post-dictatorship years. Although his campaign slogan was “unity,” he promised the displacement of the country’s liberal political oligarchy. This resonated with many, including those who had grown dissatisfied with Duterte but nonetheless continued to support him. Marcos Jr offered voters a choice between the birth of a vaguely defined “new society” or a reprise of the misery they had experienced under liberal rule.

> In the end, Bongbong Marcos may well have been carried to victory, **not only by the torrent of disinformation he unleashed** or the gush of cash he disbursed, **but also by a surge of popular resentment that he could not have conjured up on his own, but which he guilefully channeled toward his preferred direction**.

> In the face of growing repudiation of liberal politics, the only way his main opponent, Leni Robredo, could have won would have been to completely distance herself from the liberal establishment. However, instead of renouncing the neoliberal program of her political camp in favor of a more explicitly pro-worker and pro-poor platform, Robredo focused her campaign on governance reforms.

> **Although her camp signed “covenants” with various sectors such as labor and the urban poor, these commitments were often vague and largely marginal to her program**. Like her political predecessors, **Robredo equivocated on the most substantive commitments — such as abolishing all forms of labor contractualization, setting a national minimum wage, imposing a wealth tax on billionaires, or decriminalizing abortion — in order to appease her rich and conservative supporters**.

> Can we really blame those among the masses who saw through the decision of Robredo’s campaign to swap the traditional yellow campaign colors of the liberals for a new shade of pink, and repaid her prevarication with disdain? Voting data is scant but village-level tallies do suggest that Robredo’s loss represented a “protest vote” with an undeniable class character.

> While Robredo did prevail in a number of low-income provinces, for the most part, **the list of areas that she won reads like an address book of social groups that did not fare so badly after 1986: Forbes Park, Bel-Air, Corinthian Gardens, Greenhills, White Plains**. Meanwhile, Marcos Jr won practically all the informalized settlements, working-class districts, and lower middle-class areas which suffered or did not benefit much from the post-dictatorship expansion of the economy.

> **To be sure, liberals cannot be held solely responsible for the return of the Marcoses** to the seat of political power. As we have argued in an earlier essay, **many progressives in the Philippines have also played a part in this outcome by choosing to join elite-dominated coalitions** or by postponing all talk of forging a socialist program in the electoral sphere to some indefinite point in the future.

> **By doing so, they deprived people of an alternative framework to make sense of their suffering** and an emancipatory horizon toward which they could march. This effectively meant abandoning them to the Dutertes and the Marcoses as their anger boiled over and they searched for alternatives. Still, the failings of the Philippine left were by no means on the same plane as the acts of the country’s liberals in power.

> The shortcomings of the former stemmed from a position of weakness rather than strength, in contrast with those of the liberals. Their political resources were diminished and, as their ranks were decimated, their sectarianism heightened. Repression by liberals in government likewise intensified. In the face of these rapid developments, the Left also grappled with multiple constraints in updating their political analysis.

> Similarly, post-dictatorship liberal reformism faced severe constraints of its own. With products from other so-called newly industrializing countries saturating the world market, competition had become more intense than ever amidst a long economic downturn. Even in wealthier countries during this period, capitalists were refusing to invest unless state officials yielded to their demands. In this context, liberals had little reason to make concessions since the Left did not pose much of a threat.

> Nevertheless, **reformists did have choices. The post-dictatorship governments, that of Corazon Aquino and Fidel Ramos in particular, could have cultivated the support of the masses, appointed progressive officials, and banded together with other governments of the Global South to take on the power of capital. The experience of countries that chose to pursue a more redistributive route suggests that going down this path was not bound to fail**.

> **Instead, Aquino, Ramos, and their technocrats chose the other course of action. For this reason, they are primarily responsible for setting off the chain of events** and nurturing the political emotions that led to Marcos Jr’s landslide win. Bongbong is also to blame for what has happened, of course — he used stolen money to wage a deceitful campaign — but **large numbers of people only become more receptive to “disinformation” under conditions of desperation and widespread suffering**. Massive electoral advantages favoring the Right and bad messaging from the opposition only become decisive when the downtrodden have been driven to the edge.

> To leave the liberals out of the picture and absolve them of any responsibility would be to assume that elites can hurt the masses indefinitely without receiving any backlash. But as we now see so clearly, the disenchanted masses do fight back, albeit sometimes in ways that confound our expectations or hopes.

> Sometimes they do so by storming palaces or trying to establish a workers’ state. Under different historical conditions, such as **when many left-wingers collaborate with elites or vacate the political stage, they respond by voting for foul-mouthed demagogues or remorseless kleptocrats who promise to keep the liberals they despise out of power**.

> All of this is worth underscoring today because, despite the election outcome, **some on the Left still maintain that the only way to counter Marcos Jr and defeat authoritarianism in the coming years is to continue building up Robredo as the “leader of the opposition” and to keep campaigning for liberals as a possible replacement for the Marcoses and Dutertes**. The Left certainly needs to unite with all those who are opposed to Marcos Jr’s project, including liberals, but this does not mean helping restore them to power.

> The millions of people who voted for Marcos Jr over Robredo had reprehensible albeit partially rational reasons for doing so. **The liberal aspiration of “good governance” did not and will not emancipate them from the claws of neoliberalism. Why then should they have believed that it would, and why should the Left persevere in trying to convince them of this false proposition?**

> Bongbong’s victory serves as a reminder of what Antonio Gramsci emphasized long ago. Neither passive dupes nor all-powerful subjects who we should romanticize, the oppressed are capable of gaining insight into their oppression and arriving at practical solutions to their problems. Yet that insight can also remain partial and contradictory, stunted by the dominant class, and harnessed toward barbaric rather than emancipatory projects. The task of the Left in the coming years will be to help elaborate this partial insight so that instead of merely turning against the liberals and supporting their elite adversaries, the oppressed can address the root causes of their suffering.

> To do this, it is worth building on the limited yet groundbreaking accomplishments of the first openly socialist campaign for the country’s highest office, that of Leody de Guzman and Walden Bello. As Marcos Jr’s rule unveils its true face and a growing number of people realize that his promised path to liberation is in fact just another road to perdition, the Left must be out there, untethered from both liberal and conservative alliances, and providing the public with an alternative perspective for making sense of their plight as well as an emancipatory goal to march toward.

> The central question the Left faces is what outcomes it wants to achieve electorally as well as determining, in the words of Ruth Wilson Gilmore, “what work the outcome is supposed to do.” If we want to persuade people that it is only with the Left that another world is possible, we need to put forward a socialist alternative in the here and now instead of deferring this alternative to the future and relinquishing the political stage to advance short-term gains.

> This will require addressing the weaknesses that became so painfully obvious in the de Guzman/Bello campaign and **confronting the mainstream left’s mistake of supporting Robredo**. Organizing an autonomous machinery and strong social bases of power to run a presidential campaign is essential. But for this to happen, **it is urgent and imperative to abandon opportunism and self-defeating alliances with political elites**.

> Otherwise, the tide of anger and resentment that is likely to reemerge in the coming years will again be channeled toward merely restoring the disgraced post-1986 liberal order — and in the next turn of the cycle, we will once more face the specter of another despot returning to power.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/wf1tlp/by_failing_to_transform_the_philippines_liberals/,t2_bkphq,03/08/2022 17:17,57

A TALE OF 2 HISTORICAL REVISIONISMS: Why is a nuanced history of the Marcos years necessary?

by Dr. Rommel A. Curaming 

Many people think we know exactly what happened during the Marcos years from 1966 to 1986. The long-dominant narrative tells us it was not just a dark age, but the darkest one in Philippine history. This narrative took shape under the euphoria of the 1986 EDSA ‘revolution’. It was propagated by various anti-Marcos and progressive groups. These groups suffered under the regime and many of them were well-placed in the media, academia, NGOs, religious communities and basic education. Through the years, it has become the standard and hegemonic account of the period. It became a doxa, treated as a self-evident truth. One can question it only at risk of being severely castigated.

The other, increasingly assertive and bourgeoning lately, is the narrative that paints Marcos years as a/the 'golden age'. Upheld initially by hardcore Marcos loyalists, this version long existed, confined at the margins in the post-EDSA era. In recent years, it gained traction beyond the circles of Marcos loyalists enabled by the astute use of the social and other media by the BBM camp. We may also consider the positive memories of the Marcos years among segments of the population who lived through it, passing stories on to their children and grandchildren. Circulating against the backdrop of the failure of liberals-led post-EDSA regimes to meet people’s expectations, these memories fuel nostalgia for the Marcos era. As a counter-narrative to the long-established view, it is often branded as fake news or historical revisionism.

The transcendental truth contains a mix of these polar claims. Each of them has grains of truth, to what extent only God knows, but they overemphasized certain aspects and ignored others. The ‘dark age’ version projects onto the national screen the viewpoint mainly of victims of the Marcos regime. Borrowing the idea from Talitha Espiritu (2017), they allegorize what happened to them as a national tragedy, excluding the contrasting experience and views of people who appreciated what the Marcos regime did and what he stood for. That almost half of the voters voted for Marcos in 1986 snap elections suggests this segment is sizeable. This point is important to help us understand why a Marcos kept on being voted to office not just in Ilocos but nationally as well despite their family being unceremoniously removed from power in 1986. The ‘golden age’ view, on the other hand, overstates the achievements of the Marcos government while ignoring or downplaying the human rights violations, economic crisis, extravagance, corruption, cronyism and violence it committed. Both views are selective and they lack nuances expected of good history.

Plenty of books were written about the period, but balanced and comprehensive historical accounts have yet to be written. The rabid and tenacious anti-Marcos sentiment in the post-1986 years prevented this possibility. Impartiality could be costly for any scholar who dare to do it. Talitha Espiritu’s book Passionate Revolution, which I reviewed here, is a rare gem. It exemplifies the nuanced approach that we badly need. For some years, I have encouraged young Filipino historians to do oral history projects to examine what ordinary people in various places in the country actually remember about the Marcos years, and why. These generations are dying out and it is good to record their memories of the time. But no takers. Some said it is already obvious, so what is the point? Others think there are other more interesting and important topics to pursue. My hunch is that if well-designed oral history projects are done in various places, we shall see a more complex and nuanced picture of the era. Testimonies of activists, left-leaning leaders and other victims of the Marcos regime dominate accounts of the period. There are also memoirs and other accounts by pro-Marcos supporters. Both are no doubt valuable as records, but taken together, they offer partial accounts of the period, either skewed to one side or another. They are also viewed from the elite perspectives of the two camps. What must be included are accounts of daily life among ordinary people in different parts of the country. Ideally, such oral history projects should have been conducted years or decades earlier. In the wake of the stunning victory of BBM, the prevailing sentiment is likely to influence respondents’ memories of the Marcos years. Nevertheless, it still needs to be done and impartial professional historians must do it to ensure methodological rigor. They also have to do it soon before the surge of blatantly pro-Marcos efforts engulf the whole historical landscape.

Kakampinks and the mainstream media, both domestic and international, appear so sure about the sin of historical revisionism that the BBM camp is guilty of. Strictly speaking, revising history is an inherent part of writing history. We write history on the basis of available evidence. Once we find additional evidence or create a new interpretation of existing ones, it is natural to revise history. The so-called sin of historical revisionism ensues when a new version or interpretation goes against, even totally revises, the hegemonic understanding of history, such as when questions were raised about the Holocaust. Some of those who did it ended up being called historical revisionists or 'Holocaust deniers'  and got jailed or fined.  When the widely and long-entrenched 'dark age' interpretation of the Marcos years began to be challenged by the emergent 'golden era' narrative, the proponents and supporters of the 'dark age' view were indignant, charging them of revising the past. This allegation is based on the assumption that an authoritative or truthful history has already been written and no one may challenge or change it. This illiberal assumption is untenable, as a nuanced and balanced history of the period has arguably yet to be written. And even if we grant it has already been written, it is still subject to possible revisions. Nothing is cast in stone in history writing provided that there is new evidence or a new interpretation.

More interestingly, they also missed that their camp was (and still is) guilty of historical revisionism themselves, and they were and remain oblivious to it. They did it earlier, since 1986 when they promoted the Never Again and EDSA narratives[1]. This was a revisionist history, erasing the dynamics and complexity of the period by reducing it into several purely negative characteristics. Specifically, from the standpoint of almost 50% who voted for Marcos in 1986 snap election, the Never Again narrative revised their favorable memories and assessment of what happened then. That hardly anyone recognizes it as historical revisionism is a testament to the power of the victors not just to write history but to erase this power in the equation, making it seem that history spontaneously writes itself. Howls of protest may be raised about tons of evidence that attest to the cruelty of the Marcos regime, but evidence is also extant to support the other view. The point is, both sides of opposing evidence need not cancel each other to determine ""the truth"" about the period. The contrasting pictures offered by such evidence form parts of a comprehensive, textured, and more realistic representation of the past. 

Imputing moral equivalence is not the purpose of drawing parallelism between the two revisionisms. I leave judgement to the readers. My purpose is analytic correspondence and to find viable ways on how to move forward. It is necessary for us to understand the unrecognized political nature of ANY historical claims, regardless of accuracy or lack thereof. Both liberals and conservatives tend to deny the political underpinning of their preferred history. For them it is an objective history. The political character of history can only be concealed and denied, but it cannot be expunged. It is inherent in historical knowledge, among other branches of knowledge. The liberal view of the supposedly oppositional relationship between good scholarship and politics is a myth; it fantasizes the good or accurate scholarship neutralizing the political. It is a fantasy  because regardless of quality, a scholarship can be, and has actually been, used to serve any compatible political interests, good or bad, right or left or center. Knowledge assumes a life of its own as it circulates in social spaces. 

Hitler and the Nazis, for example, used the most advanced science and scholarship of the time to serve his interests, even if the scholars did not envision their work for such purposes. US, Chinese and Russian governments also do that.  The liberal view easily forgets that given the inevitable social context of knowledge production and consumption, whatever conclusion reached, accurate or not, will always favor one side or another. It cannot be neutral. More fundamentally, the very act of writing history—using historical methodology—is enabled by the collective power of the community of scholars. Impartial scholarship is the well-spring of power of scholars. It is their politics, to put it candidly. It is a kind of power whose potency and legitimacy rests on not being recognized as such. For anyone curious to know more about this line of analysis, you can read my book Power and Knowledge in Southeast Asia: Scholars and State in Indonesia and the Philippines where I analyse comparatively Marcos’s Tadhana project with Suharto’s similar project.

On part of the public, they also cannot consume history outside of the existing power relations; historical interpretation cannot exist in a socio-political vacuum. Either one agrees with the ideological left, right, or center, or with the supposedly impartial scholars. Regardless, one favors one political stance over another. This should not put us in despair. It simply is its nature. We will be in better position to do something if we know this sooner rather than later.  

If ultimately all history, regardless of quality or accuracy, is political, what is the point of aspiring for a multi-faceted and nuanced history of the Marcos period? This kind of history will allow ample space for the competing narratives. Rather than bickering endlessly on which version is 'the truth' and which one is 'fake,' we can profit more by decoding the political interests and human needs that drive competing historical claims. With multiplicity as our starting point, there is a greater chance we learn to tolerate our political and other differences and we can move forward with less historical baggage. With the sharp polarization ensuing from the 2022 elections, it is imperative various sides have to learn to co-exist civilly, if not truly peacefully.

**Senate Hearing on the Puno Constitution**

July 17, 2018

By: Christian S. Monsod

The surveys of both SWS and Pulse Asia, while sometimes contradictory due to differences on polling questions, agree that about 74% of Filipinos admit to knowing nothing or very little about the Constitution.  Thus, I ask for your indulgence to allow me a few minutes to say something about it, as well as the context in which charter change is being proposed. As someone said, text without context is pretext.

The inspiration of the 1987 Constitution was EDSA. But EDSA was more than the restoration of democracy through peaceful means. –  it was also the promise of a new social order, especially to the poor, with radical changes, but through democratic means.

Before its writing, consultations nationwide were held to listen to the people and they overwhelmingly preferred the stability of familiar structures  – a democratic,  representative, unitary presidential system, with checks and balances and separation of powers.  And, they wanted the power to directly vote for and have access to their president. But from the experience of the Marcos regime, they also wanted safeguards against the return of authoritarianism. It was not only the brutality in the violation of human rights, but the economic disaster of 1983 with total powers, or more accurately because of total powers, from which we did not recover until 2002 to the detriment of the poor. The people also wanted social justice and wanted our national destiny to be firmly and safely placed on Filipinos themselves.

Thus, there are three central themes of our Constitution – first, social justice and human rights with the poor as the center of development, second, never again to authoritarianism in any form and third, never again to any foreign domination of our economy like parity rights and amendments to the 1935 Constitution where we could not even change our exchange rate without the approval of the U.S. President. Which resulted in a foreign exchange crisis in the early fifties.

All these themes were, in many ways, counter-cultural and therefore “radical” because our history is marked by a tendency to give up powers to colonizers and dictators, of deferring to so-called “strong” leaders, of allowing big business to rule our economy and of an over-dependence of the poor on rich landowners for their basic necessities.

The 1987 Constitution can be viewed as affirmative action for our democracy - to correct the shortcomings of previous constitutions, to address the “wrongs” of history and to empower and enable the ordinary Filipino to rise above himself. It provides a system that should correct itself when it theatens to get out of control. And in that process of correction, the role of the people is critical because “sovereignty resides in the people”.

The 1987 Constitution was the first time that we spoke to the world as a truly independent and democratic Filipino nation.  It is a document that had not been imposed on us by any colonial power or by a dictatorship.

The 1987 Constitution cut the umbilical cord of the 1935 and 1973 constitutions to the United States Constitution, which gives primacy to civil and political rights because it is a country of immigrants who all started from the same position and only wanted to be free from autocracy.

Our Constitution gives social and economic rights equal primacy with civil and political rights because we are a country of inequalities from the colonial days to the present where the starting positions of the rich and the poor are not equal. Social Justice and human rights are about the adjustment of these starting positions. It is not only a central theme, but the heart, of the Constitution.

This is the Constitution under threat of overhaul because it is blamed as the source of our problems today. I submit that we have largely failed in human development not because of the Constitution but because we have not fully implemented it. No thanks to our legislators who slept on the job for 30 years.. These are the people who want to re-write the Constitution. The question to the Puno constitution and other versions and to the ConAss itself is: are the proposed revisions going to depart from or do away with these three central themes of the 1987 Constitution?

In operational terms and in relation to federalism as a means to the ultimate goals we seek, i.e. address mass poverty, gross inequalities and underdevelopment of outlying areas, I quote/paraphrase from the Philippine Human Development Report 2012-2013:

“….Human development is about the welfare of people, not the development of places. The nature of economic development is uneven. It is not about bringing jobs to people but about closing the distance between the people and the jobs by giving people the capabiity and mobility to choose where to go. But the principle is different when it comes to quality education and quality health care. Breaking the vicious cycle of poverty of the young means bringing these services to wherever they are regardless of the cost. That is what human development is about.,,,,,,”

We might also note that if a federal (or federal-parliamentary) system is critical to our future, why is there no mention of it at all in  the Philippine Development Plan 2017-2022 and Ambisyon2040, launched by President Duterte on October 11, 2016, including the means to achieve on a year to year basis its Results Matrices with about 300 targets?

The Philippine Development Plan also addresses the problem of unequal development in our country that the President talks about, with what is called the NSS (National Spatial Strategy) to maximize the benefits of what economists call economic agglomeration.

In other words, the design of government interventions to achieve development outcomes does not require a shift to a federal (or federal-parliamentary) system.

This is not the time to go into details, but my answer to the question with regard to the Puno Commission is a definite yes – that it departs from or does away with the central themes of the 1987 Constitution.

The list of questionable provisions is rather long but we might think about the implications of some examples that depart from those central themes:

* (a) the idea of a “surveillance warrant”  ,

* (b) the deletion of the phrase “guarantees full respect for human rights”,

* (c) the absence of “distributive programs” in the exclusive powers of the federal government that development experts say should be centralized under any system because of the need to have uniformity of scope and outcomes,

* (d) the provisions with “in an emergency” where the Congress OR the President can act with extraordinary powers;

* (e) the addition of “lawless violence” to proclaim martial law;

* (f) giving the Congress the power to change the foreign ownership requirements on land, natural resources, public utilities which are critical to the lives of the poor.

Since the issue of foreign direct investment (FDI) has been brought up by the ConCom, allow me to comment on it.

The economic argument against limitations on foreign ownership is that it stifles the investment climate and competition resulting in lost employment and growth opportunities,and that such restrictions are, therefore, anti-poor.  This noble rhetoric is far from the truth. FDI is closer to what Prof. Emeritus Michael Meyer of Wharton School pointed out in a Business World article (9/24/14)--that the “ethos of capitalism is you operate for your shareholders rather than for the whole people”.  

But even with that kind of self-interest, what is the empirical evidence since the enactment of the 1987 Constitution and its limitations on foreign ownership?.

First:  From 1960-2009, our average per capita real growth rate was 1.58% a year, the lowest in our part of the world. But from 1988 when the new constitution took effect, we have been growing steadily at a faster trajectory than before. More importantly, from 2010-2017 our GDP grew at an average of 6.4% /yr and per capita real income by 4.5% a year. That is higher than the growth rate of Thailand over the same period.  

Second; The Philippines has performed very well compared to its regional neighbors. With a growth rate of 6.7% in 2017, it grew faster than the average of the EMDE in the EAP (6.4%) and faster than its ASEAN-5 neighbors.  Only China, Vietnam, and Cambodia grew faster (6.8%).

At that rate, we will be doubling our GDP per capita every 15.6  years. During the Pnoy watch, poverty incidence went down from about 26.5% to about 21.5%.

Third; No wonder then that the UNCTAD World Investment Report 2016 predicted that between 2016 and 2018 the Philippines  is among the top 15 preferred investment destinations of Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) --  US(2), China(1), India(3), UK(4), Germany(7), Japan(10), Brazil(4), Mexico(8), Indonesia(14), Malaysia(14), Philippines (-), France(10), Australia(10), Myanmar(-), Vietnam(18).(x)=2014 ranking. Philippines and Myanmar did not rank at all in 2014

Two countries were bumped off from that top 15 list – Hongkong and Singapore – to make way for us and Myanmar. And all this took place under the present constitution, and with a unitary form of government.  

So what is all the screaming about the need to revise the pro-Filipino constitutional provisions with charter change?

What we should be screaming about is why the benefits of growth and the increases in labor productivity are not distributed equitably with labor, if we really care for the poor.

Real wage has been stagnant in the Philippines despite relatively high economic growth and labor productivity improvements. Real wages need to reflect at least labor productivity, but that has not happened in the Philippines. Between 2001 and 2016, real GDP more than doubled, growing by 5.4 percent per year on average. During this time, labor productivity also increased substantially, 57 percent between 2005 and 2015, with an average growth rate of 3.1 percent per year. However, real wage did not move. Aggregate real wage remained flat between 2001 and 2016 with 7 out of 15 years registering a negative growth rate. This could be part of the reason for the slow progress on poverty reduction and on inequality despite high growth performance in the last decade.

In effect, business has been able to appropriate all the benefits to themselves. Can this be solved by a sructural shift to a federal-parliamentary form of government? Or is this simply a problem of public policy and the full implementation of the social justice provisions on labor?

It may well be that our economic growth might have been higher with a higher FDI. But that is different from saying that we need FDI badly and must adjust our standards to their demands.

FDI may have a role to play in our development, but what counts is not the quantity but the quality of the investment. For that, we need to make a full accounting not just of its benefits but also of its costs both internal and eternal to the project, and such long-term considerations as brownfield vs. greenfield investment, its contribution to raising the trajectory of our technological development and downstream plants for our minerals that increase the value added in the country.  

According to the World Investment Report and other reports, the factors that affect investment decisions are:​

​​a) adequate infrastructure;
​​
b) skill levels (human capital);
​​
c) quality of the general regulatory framework;
​​
d) clear rules of the game;
​​
e) fiscal determination;
​​
f) the relative absence of graft and corruption.  

Other surveys include low levels of criminality and political instability.

The point is that if we conscientiously attend to these factors, we may have more FDI, but on our terms. In fact, the World Bank does not put lifting restrictions on reserved areas for local control as a priority to attract FDI. They know that it is a fact of public policy in most developing countries, as it was for developed countries when they were themselves developing.  

Moreover, our country is already open for the purposes of FDI in long-term land leases, mineral mining  (Art. XII, Sec. 2 and the La Bugal case), in power generation and supply with the Electric Power Industry Reform Act of 2001 (EPIRA) which limits foreign ownership only in the natural monopolies of transmission and distribution, as it should be for national security reasons.

Be careful of a sweeping overhaul of our constitutional system.

I would venture to say that we should be very careful about a sweeping overhaul of our constitutional system with a president who has proven to be dangerous with power, especially if the transition also extends the terms of incumbent politicians and an otherwise banned president is allowed to run for re-election under the new Constitution.. And also because the Puno constitution bans any future revision or amendment of it’s “federal setup”  which is declared “indissoluble” and “permanent” and at par with the words “democratic” and “representative”. In other words,  we will be stuck forever with federalism if we adopt it with all its uncertainties and the risk of unintended consequences.

Allow me to cite two views on the situation in our country today.

Two weeks ago was a Forum of an international NGO about the future of their operations here because of its external environment both international and domestic. Its list of uncertainties in the Philippines were: democratic space, rule of law, political institutions, civil and political space, domestic and foreign policy, the government’s openness to international aid and development assistance, martial law, revolutionary government and excalating conflicts in Mindanao.

Last week, Prof Noel de Dios (UP School of Economics) at a forum cited the threats to the economy under the Duterte Administration described as “insults”, as in medicine, which causes damage to a tissue or an organ:
​
(1) Uncertainty insult​​

- precipitate policy changes (mining, online gaming, Boracay)

- threatened railroading of charter change

(2) Redistribution insult

• 2018 inflation surprise (TRAIN, confused monetary policy, rice fiasco)

• reliance on indirect taxation (TRAIN)

• leaky-bucket entitlements (free college tuition, salary increases 
to the police and the military, pensioners, free irrigation services)

(3)Selectivity insult

• targeted weaponisation of laws and rules (tax laws, SEC rules, labour laws, franchises, civil service rules, etc.)

• revolving-door of discredited cronies and supporters

• opaque favouring of certain local and foreign business interests

• implicit bias against participation of (some) private sector interests (hence ODA and government procurement in lieu of PPP)

(4) Impunity and threat insult

• “homicide cases under investigation”:  23,518 in the period 1.7.2016-11.6.2018 (Rappler); recent LCE assassinations

• threats and actions against institutions, e.g., the Ombudsman, Chief Justice, the political opposition, media, HR workers, and the Church

(5) War and disorder insult

• Marawi and Mindanao martial law

• Threatened national emergencies

• On-off peace talks with the CPP-NPA-NDF

“Despite the president’s seeming disinterest in economic policy, what throws a shadow over business and the economy is the demonstration of overarching power –  power without checks, without accountability, and without regard for custom, values, or history.

“More than the soundness of policy, it is unbridled power and its selective application that is the source of worry for business and the people under the Duterte administration”

We are told that our leaders not only shape our lives but also our values. The Marcos years was not only about human rights and an economic disaster, it was also about a legacy of a culture of corruption that remains to this day. From the experience of the last 2 years it’s clearer now that the Duterte Administration knows how to govern only through the use of fear and force. Thus, if the Marcos legacy is a culture of corruption, then the Duterte legacy may be a culture of violence.

A book entitled “How Democracies Die” published earlier this year, among several books on the same subject, says that:

(1) where authoritarianism during the cold war was imposed through coup d’etats by the military, since then authoritarianism has been assumed by elected leaders through constitutional revisions that would allow them to stay in power indefinitely, i.e. Fujimori of Peru, Chavez of Venezuela, Erdogen of Turkey, even our Marcos and several others.;

(2) any one (or two) of these four signs means that an elected leader wants to become a dictator:

(a) rejects in words or actions the democratic rules of   the game, both in written constitutions or unwritten norms of conduct and civility in a functioning democracy;

(b) denies the legitimacy of opponents;

(c) tolerates or encourages violence;

(d) indicates a willngness to curtain the civil liberties of opponents
Are these happening in the Philippines today?

Think about Sen. Leila de Lima and of former SC CJ Sereno or about the House and its deference to the Quo Warranto proceeding. Or of the SC with it total deference to the President on the proclamation and extension of martial law. Such that now, the President is empowered to declare martial law anywhere anytime in the Philippines. Or the attempt at a zero budget for the Commission on Human Rights and the attacks on the Ombudsman who is retiring this month and will likely be replaced by a loyal follower.

With the weakening of the constitutional “checking powers” of the Congress, of the Supreme Court, the Office of the Ombudsman and of the media (i.e. Rappler and the PDI, among others), the President has almost total powers even without charter change. However, there remained the potential checking power of the church to deal with. There are only 3 institutions with a nationwide reach in our country – the LGUs, the police/military establishment and the Church. That may account for the latest attempt to smear the “source” of its power – God.

All this may constitute, wittingly or unwittingly, a step towards what mental health experts refer to as “malignant normality” which can take different forms but, in the case of democratic countries, would consider aberrant behavior or language as part of the democratic process. Thus, a dangerous leader becomes normalized, and malignant normality would dominate the governing dynamic. Clearly, this situation endangers our democracy and should not be allowed to continue.

In fact, I believe that we are already on the slippery slope to authoritanism and a new constitution that allows it or provides for it would be the ultimate betrayal of the Filipino people who brought us out from the darkness of a dictatorship,

In reading the Puno constitution, I had the impression that its proposals of a sweeping overhaul of the Constitution is more an act of faith than a product of reasoned  thinking because it forgets or ignores the situation in our country today and the context of charter change.

During its 5.month tenure, the ConCom failed to provide the road map for the transition to a federal system.

That is made the task of a Transitory Commission headed by the President whether in his present capacity (or as a transitional one), who also appoints the 10 other members from a list provided by a 5-person search committee headed by the Chair of the Civil Service Commission, with the four members also appointed by, you guessed it, the President.

It has dictatorial powers - legislative powers by decree-making to formulate the transition plans of the federal government, every federated region,and the branches of government; executive powers to act and implement the transition plans; and judicial powers to settle disputes arising from the plans.

It can hire and fire any government official or employee of the government.

It has the power to organize, re-organize and establish all the branches and agencies of government, on fiscal management and administration plans, on the appropriation, allocation and expenditures of the moneys of government and to exercise all the powers necessary and proper to ensure the smooth, speedy and successful transition.

Putting the constitution to a vote before the transition plans are formulated means that the people, especially in the outlying areas, who are supposed to primarily benefit from the shift, are asked to approve a constitutional shift to a federal system without knowing how and when they will become federated regions with the powers and the money promised to them.  They will only know that after the Transitory Commission has formulated the transition plan for their region, which could take years.

With these dictatorial powers for at least three years, who do you think will win the first elections under the new constitution?

What are the imponderables in all this?

(a) There is the imponderable of what the President really wants. Hence the need for real independent thinkers involved in the process and not people who are quick to carry out the wishes of the president, i.e a transitional president

(b) The issue of a joint or separate vote, and what the senate does if the vote is separate;

(c) The final ConAss version, given that it will surely reflect the power plays of the political dynasties and the compromises of politicians in their self-interest;

(d) Can free and fair elections be conducted under martial law?

(e) And finally the judgment of the people in the plebiscite.

In closing, may I say that:

(1) I believe that there is a statesman in every politician and it is up to us to find it in whatever way we can. As long as there is a window of rationality, however small the opening, it is worth the effort to try;

(2) Democracy is about dialogue and compromise. There is very little space in the room for purists.. But we all have a right to be heard;

(3)​We are willing to work together on the goal of a new social order using the lens of social justice and peace-making without resorting to a revolutionary government or a major overhaul of the Constitution. However, I believe that there are provisions proposed by the ConCom that are good ideas that should be considered for legislation.

(4) ​Bringing the President down with people power is not a good idea. He is a duly-elected President and is still a beacon of hope to many of the poor;

(5)​ If he does not want to talk or insists on taking the charter change and federalism route, we may have a fight in our hands for our rights and our freedoms. We have fought five of the last 6 presidents on issues of principle and won all of them.                                                                                                   
(6) I believe that federalism is not the answer to addressing mass poverty and gross inequalities and the underdevelopment of the outlying areas. And I believe that our people will know if a charter change is really for their benefit and will act accordingly.                                   

As a Pulitzer awardee reminds:“the most common way that people lose their power is when they think that they don’t have any.”

"Walden Bello: EDSA, Neoliberalism, and Globalization","*(Delivered at Coalesce Conference, sponsored by Ateneo Lex, Ateneo de Manila, March 18, 2017.)*

By Walden Bello

Most of you had not yet seen the light of day when the EDSA Uprising took place in February 1986. To my generation, this event was a memorable step in the Philippines struggle for democracy. The three decades that followed were marked by the reign of liberal democracy as the country’s political regime. Those thirty years coincided with the rise and dominance of neoliberalism as an economic ideology and globalization as an economic trend.

**It is now clear that those three decades constituted a lost opportunity for the Filipino people**, that the promise of the EDSA Republic was subverted by the neoliberal and pro-globalization policies that were adopted by the administrations that reigned between 1986 and 2016. **It is also evident from the tumultuous events of the last year that what we now call Dutertismo is to a great extent an angry and resentful reaction to the EDSA Republic’s failure to live up to the promise that accompanied its birth**.

My focus in this talk will be on how **neoliberalism and globalization combined with the continuing gross inequality in the distributed of income and wealth to subvert the promise of EDSA**. I would like begin, however, by briefly discussing the failure of EDSA to deliver on the political front.

-----

Unhealthy Birthmarks

There were three unhealthy birthmarks that marred the EDSA Republic: the role of the military, the intervention of the United States, and the leadership of the elite.

The prominent role of the military rebels in triggering the insurrection gave them a sense of having a special role in the post-Marcos dispensation. Only after seven failed coups was civilian constitutional role stabilized. But, in retrospect, military discontent was not as damaging to the EDSA Republic as US patronage and elite hegemony.
The US was not only a player; it was a decisive player. Even before the Aquino assassination in 1983, **Washington sought to nudge Marcos and the elite opposition to arrive at some compromise. These pressures escalated in 1985, resulting in Marcos’ calling for the snap elections that became the vehicle for the mobilization of the middle class and some of the popular sectors against the regime and paving the way for the military mutiny**. At that point powerful forces in Washington overcame President Ronald Reagan’s reluctance to cut Marcos loose and moved to directly remove the dictator from the scene. At an off off-the-record briefing at the State Department on April 23, 1986, to which I was mistakenly invited, **Undersecretary of State Michael Armacost openly boasted of how the US moved during Marcos’ last months in power: ""Our objective was to capture... to encourage the democratic forces of the center, then consolidate control by the middle and also win away the soft support of the NPA [New People's Army]. So far, so good.""**

The US role in serving as midwife led it to consider the EDSA regime as a protectorate. While the opposition of the Senate majority to the new bases treaty was disconcerting to Washington, it got what it wanted from the government in virtually all other areas. It got Cory Aquino to make repayment of the foreign debt--especially that owed to US banks--the top priority of the new government. And it eventually brought its overwhelming military presence back with the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, where Cory’s son, President Benigno Aquino III, agreed to allow Washington to set up US bases in nominally Philippine bases.

**The third flaw of the EDSA Revolution is that it was an uprising whose direction was set by the anti-Marcos factions of the elite.** Their aim was to restore competition among the elites while containing pressures for structural change. The 1987 Constitution enshrined the rhetoric of democracy, human rights, due process, and social justice, but these aspirations were frozen in amber owing to the dearth of implementing laws and actions that would translate them into reality. **Via periodic electoral exercises the factional monopoly of power under Marcos became a class monopoly, open to intra-elite competition for the most important national, regional, and local offices but virtually closed to the lower orders as money politics became the order of the day**.

-----

The Neoliberal Debacle

Despite its political shortcomings, the EDSA regime would probably have retained a significant amount of support had it delivered on the economic front. **Indeed, it would be an understatement to say that the EDSA system failed to translate its promise of delivering less poverty, more equality, and more social justice into reality.**
Perhaps the key tragedy of the EDSA Republic was that it came into being right at the time that neoliberalism was on the ascendant as an ideology and globalization became the flavor of the month for capitalism. Even before the February 1986 uprising, the Philippines had become one of four guinea pigs of the new structural adjustment program unveiled by the World Bank, which aimed to bring down tariffs, deregulate the economy, and privatize government enterprises.

As noted above, under the administration of Corazon Aquino, pressure from the International Monetary Fund and US banks made repayment of the foreign debt the top national economic priority, and Washington and the IMF ensured that succeeding administrations would follow suit by having Congress adopt the automatic appropriations law that made repayment of the state’s debt the first cut in the national budget. Over the next three decades, debt servicing would take up to 20 to 45% of the annual government budget, crippling the government's capacity to invest and stimulate economic growth and provide essential social services.

**With the 1992-98 administration of Fidel Ramos, neoliberalism reached its apogee: tariffs were radically cut to zero-to-five percent, deregulation and privatization were sped up, and the Philippines joined the World Trade Organization — to “benefit”, it was said, from the tide of corporate-driven globalization.** Under Ramos and later administrations, the contours of the EDSA political economy were firmed up: pro-market policies, relentless privatization, export-oriented development, export of labor, low wages to attract foreign investors, and conservative monetary and fiscal management. **As the Philippines’ neighbors retained high levels of economic protectionism**, neoliberal policies contributed to the Philippines' having the second lowest yearly average growth rate in Southeast Asia from 1990 to 2010. Even the second-tier ASEAN economies of Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, and Burma outstripped it.

The sad reality is that liberalization was a program of unilateral disarmament that resulted in the destabilization of almost all sectors of manufacturing, resulting in deindustrialization. **Let me cite the sad plight of our once world-class shoe industry.** In the 1960’s and 1970’s, our shoe industry based in Marikina was very dynamic, with some 2000 factories. Owing to liberalization and smuggling, there are only some 100 factories left today. And with the demise of the industry, the leather and tanning industry that serviced the shoe industry whose center was Meycawayan, Bulacan, also virtually disappeared.

Let us briefly touch on our agriculture. Before we joined the World Trade Organization in 1995, were a net agricultural exporting country. Free trade turned us into a net agricultural importing country, with cheap imports eroding all sectors of the industry from vegetables to grain to poultry and meat. The crisis of our farmers stems not only from the continuing unequal distribution of land but also from the deprotectionization of our agricultural economy.

Deindustrialization and agro-destabilization were one face of globalization. The other was **our conversion into a remittance dependent economy as we were pushed into an international division of labor in which we became a prime exporter of cheap labor to the global economy**. In short, globalization involved the disintegration of our domestic economy and our integration into the global economy was provider of low-wage unskilled and semi-skilled labor. To a great extent, education has become a process of preparing workers for export abroad. As the former chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Overseas Workers, who witnessed first hand the tremendous insecurity of our migrant workers, I can tell you that this was a bad bargain.

Let me continue. Although the economy registered 6-7% growth rates from 2012 to 2015, **there was no “trickle down” to counter the legacy of stagnation bequeathed by neoliberal policies. At nearly 25% of the population, the percentage living in poverty in 2015 was practically the same as in 2003. The gini coefficient, the best summary measure of inequality, jumped from 0.438 in 1991 to 0.506 in 2009, among the highest in the world**. For many Filipinos, the statistics were superfluous. Extreme poverty was so wretchedly visible in the big urban poor clusters within and surrounding Metro Manila and in depressed rural communities throughout the country.

Corruption and Class

The neoliberal paradigm was not, however, the only cause of the EDSA regime's failure to address the deepening social crisis. Corruption was a problem, as it was in the Philippines' neighbors. The administrations of Joseph Estrada and Gloria Macapagal Arroyo became synonymous with unbridled corruption.

But even more consequential than corruption was class. Just as they had forced Marcos to halt his land reform program in the 1970s, **the landed class successfully resisted the implementation of Republic Act 6657, Cory Aquino's already watered-down land reform program. A civil society push to reenergize the program, which was passed in 2009, bogged down under the Benigno Aquino III administration owing to lack of political will and presidential indifference.** By the end of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program with Extension Law (CARPER) in 2014, about 700,000 hectares of the best private land in the country remained in the hands of landlords, violence against land reform beneficiaries was common, and rural poverty remained stubbornly high.
Unaccompanied by structural reforms, the World Bank-supported Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) anti-poverty program of the Aquino administration, though it eventually covered some 4.4 million families, or nearly one-fifth of the population, could barely make a dent on poverty and inequality.

-----

Over the Cliff

Class callousness, double standards, and inept governance finally drove the EDSA Republic to the edge of the cliff during the Aquino III period. **Popular support had steadied the EDSA Republic when it was challenged by military coups in the late eighties. By 2016, however, three decades of disillusionment had made it a tired, discredited system waiting to be pushed over the cliff, and it was, by the electoral insurgency that brought Duterte to power and his moves toward fascism.** Dutertismo is EDSA’s vengeful offspring even as the administration has not broken with the EDSA Republic’s failed economic policies. That is, however, another story.

So let me just end by saying that neoliberalism and globalization have been discredited globally, especially after the 2008 global financial crisis. **Our experience is not unique. And the response has been, as in the Philippines, a turn towards fascist or authoritarian populist solutions. The challenge to us at this point is to break with this failed model and junk the old mantras about the so-called benefits of globalization. That won’t be easy, but we have no choice**.

Thank you.
