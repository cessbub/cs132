How do you stop stalking your stressors?,"I have this toxic habit to stalk my stressor and urge to know what's going their life everyday. Kung hndi ko sila eh stalk, I keep having meltdowns or panic attacks. 

I know at the end ako yung masasaktan to know their having the best time of their lives. Pero may suffering padin saaken if hndi ko gawin. 

Can you give me help? or any recommendations on how to overcome this fear?",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/17dnau3/how_do_you_stop_stalking_your_stressors/,t2_7d9dd61z,2023-10-22 14:53:23,22
Stalking neighbours or auditory hallucinations,"18/04/2023 

Soon I will visit the farewell reunion of an old elementary school that was to be transformed. Today my neighbors said that since I was coming by, no one apparently hurt me during my school there and that it would never be the truth that I would have schizophrenia. They want to make me a person with schizophrenia when there's nothing true about that. ""Game,"" they say. Wait till this comes out then I will have someone psychiatric like they have now ""that Aaron, Aaron, those of schizophrenia (I) have as someone who does not normally chizophrenic according to them. Besides, I've heard people say they don't get me screwed up. Beating and healing they do. 

Late evening Cedric (left) said by the way that ""a young man"" would be right about 'that' (I) deserving such an exaggeration. Caroline said that no young man said that and that both of them know that. 

They look into others' heads to know their past. Someone from the neighbors said this evening that there are others who are still not allowed to take that trust in those women, even though there are people who let themselves be done.



19/04/2023 

After what I had written and forwarded to my brother this morning, they know about this and know nothing as usual. Now david (right) says that my schizophrenia was never ""lied"", where Madeleine (right), who does not live there, literally says that she ""who with his schizophrenia"" would have never ""lied"", so to speak. 

David (right) says that 'they' (others) said that they should not take anyone for this and that they should have taken another fortune teller each time. Madeleine (right) now: ""That they said they failed because of Cedric (me)."" David (right) now: ""Now I'm speaking to that little brother: Cedric you have failed."" But actually they're not talking to me, they're talking in the form of a conversation. 

Now I say I would post it again on Reddit soon, now they get scared and David (right) says it will never be true of him what I claim because Madeleine (right) does not want me to fail my exams so to speak. What people don't all do for love. 

People used to ditch me, for the reason I behave to them, the voices. If people ditch me because I'm acting like this to them because they're going too far with what they call jokes, and i'm not easy-going, then that's a no-concern to me. It's really weird that those voices once said I can't know them as a person. Then the voice of David (right neighbor) says through the wall that those who are young should not spread such lies. Ironic. 

Besides, I'd be lonely, not able to stand up to people who talk about me and have schizophrenia. I'd be a man with a lot of mental health problems according to the voices. I heard someone (woman) telling me once, from a distance, i don't know who, that i have to admit that i have mental health problems and that she was suprised i didn't react on that. Why should i, right?",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/12rqxyi/stalking_neighbours_or_auditory_hallucinations/,t2_jdcp10o8,2023-04-19 20:03:58,3
"I Was Stalked By 3 Middle Aged Men Last Night, Now What?","I’m 16 and I was fishing in the canal when a car pulled up and just stayed their for a while and left, then not long after another car pulled up and a guy came up and walked up to me strangely, so when he came up to me I pulled out a knife and put it behind my back but he then walked up to me again, I was in the middle of him and his car so I waved my knife around and protected my stuff and he was unfazed but didn’t come any closer, so i left and another guy came out of the car so I didn’t go close but then a 3rd guy came from the other side of the road so I backed up and tried to get help but he went around and blocked me off so I went back and the 3rd guy was gone but another person came and was standing near my stuff but wasn’t taking anything as if they were luring me and the last 3 people were acting strange like staring at the water, humping the pole and grabbing their pants.

Neighbours stalking,"07/07/2022 

Sometimes the voices of the neighbors say that, after I get angry about the things that are being said and I don't care about what has been said because I have talked about it, I have placed it mentally. This would then be the intention again and again. 

Something that has to do with my new education: 

Woman: ""He will translate us."" 

Right neighbor Cedric: ""Nobody doesn't want him for this anymore."" 

Young man outside: ""So they just destroy his young brother. They don't do schizophrenia with him."" 

Young man outside: ""His little brother feels that pain. Because we are boaring against him too much. He becomes a schizophrenic."" 

Someone outside said that I shouldn't whine about this, but that I should crack the code. 

Young guy outside: ""Hahaha, his young brother is not allowed to boar about that code. They're cracked."" 

Young man outside: ""Then they're going to put on for him because they know he's not a spast like that."" 

Girl outside: ""For you are 'schizophrenia' here."" 

Neighbor: Cedric: ""It's best that he's not 'Schizophrenia' here anymore."" (Never hear anyone say this to me as an address, but okay.) 

Young woman outside: ""Cedric is not allowed to wave his dick here."" 

They sometimes say things hoping that I would cry.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/vtz0px/neighbours_stalking/,t2_jdcp10o8,2022-07-08 09:48:37,1
Stalking neighbours or auditory hallucinations,"12/07/2022 

After I read a reaction in silence, there was another voice that said that the things I wrote down were probably not going to be about me. And that probably must be a lie again when it is very clear. Even though it doesn't matter. My friendships should be ruined by this. According to the voices, i have to learn something out of this?? Strange. 

Man outside: ""He doesn't get any grief. It's getting to him."" 

Young woman outside: ""Cedric doesn't get that grief yet."" 

Right David: ""Because he always stands there alone. They get that. They said there was something wrong with him."" 

Young woman outside: ""It's also getting to Cedric."" 

Right Madeleine: ""You can't fall in love with a boy, because you're hot."" 

Man outside: ""They found him much better. They can't diagnose him with Schizophrania. If his TV is too loud, they shouldn't be clapping it with it."" 

Man outside: ""That they're afraid that they're going to get him into a treatment."" 

Young woman outside: ""He had nothing to do with him. He hasn't learned anything about it. That we are really annoying. He took that as a lesson."" 

Young woman outside: ""He has learned nothing from it."" 

Young woman outside: ""Maybe he wants only positive reactions."" 

Young man outside: ""His god has been roosed."" 

Woman outside: ""They can beat him in that. That he, that is because of boredom, doesn't know."" 

Young man outside: ""That's caught red-handed by this guy. That's an asshole."" 

Young man outside: ""He couldn't have caught us red-handed in it."" 

Right Madeleine: ""They noticed that something was wrong with him."" 

Woman outside: ""They said he lied about Reddit, because no one describes him."" 

Right David: ""You can't take medication. For we are going to tease you you're whole life. We can tease them as long as they don't take those pills."" 

Left veronique: ""They're right. It DOESN'T help."" 

Right Madeleine: ""They're lying that he gets it again."" 

Right David: ""He couldn't accomplish that."" 

Right Madeleine: ""They're lying that he was the hottest.""

Spouse thinks he’s being targeted,"My husband (32) has been going on for the past year that he’s being gang stalked. It’s really annoying because he can’t go one day without saying that I (30f) is gang stalking him. He even goes as far as saying that our daughters 12 and 8 are in on it. He believes that there’s people attacking him with “energy weapons” and that pretty much everyone everywhere is in on it. We can be driving and anyone who has a headlight that doesn’t work is in on it . Any car alarms that go off or sirens are supposedly to get him annoyed. Apparently he’s part of a group of people known as targeted individuals that are being tracked on an app that everyone has so they know when the targeted individuals are nearby. I’m really really tired of it. It has consumed his life which has now consumed mine. I’m tired of being called a perpetrator. I can’t even cough, sneeze or scratch my nose without him making some dumb remark about me doing it to gang stalk him. Is anyone going through the same thing with their SO? Any advice on how to handle this?",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/18u9d5r/spouse_thinks_hes_being_targeted/,t2_r77ry52c,2023-12-30 14:46:56,12

 So i am sure she has issues with her mental health. he felt being stalked, his SC media being hacked and even monitoring her through cctv's of random establishment if we're going out.. there is this instance pa nga he said me bumubulong aa kanya.

So ito na nga...
I would really want to reach out sa family members nya, i am sure they are not aware coz he was not like this before, this something new that came up lang around 2019 and it's been going on for 4 years na.

Trauma EX inflicted,"Ex is enjoying his happy ending and yet created a line of traumas people

Disclaimer: It’s not about me but more of a genuine concern to the people he hurt and I can sense that this has terribly created a trauma.

backstory: 33F. I’ve started dating in my 30’s during the height of the pandemic. I met this guy in a dating app. He was not my ideal but I warmed up for a you-know-a-too-good-to-be-true-man who I admit, I fail to get to know better. We hit off after 2 weeks of dating and I gave him my everything. Literally. After a few weeks, he went cold shoulder and unfriended/unfollowed me in all my socmed. Cut lines but managed to contact me so gave him a chance to explain. He told me his ex was suicidal because of their break up. He told me he was already over with her for quite some time but didn’t know what to do. He was crying and was trying to win me back and I didn’t understand what was happening. He was already manipulating me with his sad stories and even telling me about his childhood. So, as dumb as I can be, we got back together after that. It was on and off and went on for 2 years until I realize it was not worth it. He was giving me bare minimum and the pain that it created burdened me up until  now. It resulted to a trauma.

As I was trying to put myself back together, and admittedly cannot stop myself from stalking him, I found him trying to woo another girl again. I was hurt of course, but I couldnt do anything about it so I let it as it is. Not too long, the didn’t end up together. And want to know what happened next? He is with his ex right now. The one whom I mentioned he broke up before he met me. Shitty.

As I continued to stalk the other girl (the one he met after me), I saw how she is trying to get through what happened to her. She’s opening up her life to the public and letting them see she is healing from the pain. She is a beautiful soul. A genuine person who wanted to meet somebody and yet ended up with some shit-bastard. I have gone through the healing phase. I know I am not healed yet but I know to myself I dont want to be with that person again and I want to comfort her.

Is it right to reach out to the 2 girls (the before and after me)? I wanted to help what theyre going through. There’s that urge that I need to do something.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/1b647sq/trauma_ex_inflicted/,t2_szscg8fgw,2024-03-04 14:38:53,0

DEALING WITH A FRIEND WITH MENTAL ISSUES,"DEALING WITH A FRIEND WITH MENTAL ISSUES

Hello, I am not sure if this is the right thread for this but I want to seek help from you guys. I have a friend and he is so broken-hearted. My history of cheating with his partner pero dahil dun nagkaron ng extreme actions na nagawa yung friend ko. Nagreresult na ng violence and stalking his ex. As a friend, it pains me to see my friend na ganito. I already advised him to open up to his family and seek professional help para ma-guide siya. Alam kong may mas malala pa syang trauma but I am not a professional para ma-diagnose sya. Pero nagsusuffer na dn ako mentally. Strong yung mentality ko but its affecting me na din kasi ilang beses ko na dn siyang sinabihan about this and gives him assurance na I am here for him. But this this time, what he really needs is to talk to a professional to help him mentally. I love my friend and I want to help him but as a friend hindi ko dn alam yung limit kung ano pwede ko gawin. I have issues din na I am dealing with and I am not available lagi. My wife already told me na as a friend you can only do so much pero kung hindi pa dn makikinig yung friend ko sa akin about seeking help mentally that's my limit. Naiitindihin dn ng wife ko pero she is concern na its affecting me mentally and its beyond my capability na as a friend. Kaya I advise my friend to talk to his family na din to check on his state.

"I became a derangedly, delusional, obsessed stalker and I need to let this out anonymously","Disclaimer: A long vent. A ***very*** long one.

And I'm not the type of person who usually posts anything about myself online, much less something personal. I hate being vulnerable. But after what's practically a cocktail of medications I've been taking that's increasing, decreasing in dosage, getting replaced, having to find a substitute for because the usual brand I buy is out of stock. You name it. And none of them seem to work, but I have a lot of negative side effects? I'm just tired. 

I understand bitches who would doubt the validity of your, my, struggles exist. Fuck, there are still plenty others who believe mental health is a sham. And I'm not mentally well enough to handle that. 

But today, I give in. 

A little lotta bit about me:

* I've been symptomatic of plenty of mental illnesses from a very young age.
* I'm diagnosed with BD type 1. 
* Under evaluation for schizoaffective disorder.
* I have a history of dissocial behavior.
* I am under evaluation for a personality disorder, but god knows what PD that is. My psychiatrist wouldn't tell. Feels like I'm collecting mental illness like pokemon at this point.
* I have a grandiose sense of self and pretty vain, especially when manic.
* I grew up in a religious family. This is important.

I'll try to keep it short. 

**TW: future mentions of abuse, self harm, stalking**

Besides the non-religious aspect of my life which caused me to get beat up until I was forced to pretend to be religious and secretly self-harm, my family actually treats me well. So well that unless religion is brought up, it feels like I'm growing up in a healthy environment. 

Despite that, I was aggressive. I had hurt other kids when I was a kid. I did everything I can to cause them pain. And if they caused me pain, I make sure to double it and give it back to them. I would never do that to a child now that I'm an adult, self-aware, and know better.

But one thing to note is that I lack empathy and I never felt guilt my whole life. All my relationships had always been transactional and I believe it's because I despise vulnerability. Maybe I subconsciously instilled in myself that I won't allow anyone to hurt me ever again. I could never relate to people on a personal level or form meaningful relationships with anyone and I do not wish to. 

And this is one of the many reasons why I'm so exhausted.

Make it make sense. If I'm against relationships so much, then why am I so obsessive?

There was this foreign boy in my class. I didn't give a fuck about him at all. There were even times I talked shit about him. He was pretty confused all the time. He couldn't understand simple concepts. Shit, he wasn't even physically attractive to me at all. 

My ""friends"" would usually make fun of him. Honestly, I was the lesser bitch out of all of them because I kept a more open mind. ""Maybe he's experiencing brain fog? He could be medicated for a medical condition."" 

I was projecting. I know firsthand how it feels to experience constant confusion and brain fog due to being heavily medicated with shit that sounds like poison. Still, I had no interest in him.

""May crush ako kay Kian."" One of my ""friends,"" who I partially disliked due to her pushiness about religion, admitted. Kian is that foreign boy they made fun of. And ever since then, all hell broke loose.

It started off with observing him, questioning what makes him attractive to her.

It just so happens that during this time, Kian would often interact with me for whatever reason. And maybe it's because I'm a natural at being nosy, but I thought it was a great opportunity to ask him personal questions.

I found out he's an atheist and bisexual along with a ton of other information that I know my ""friend"" would disagree with. In guise of being a concerned friend, I let her know all these things. My goal was to make him as unattractive to her as possible and I don't know why. What was I trying to achieve with this, really? No, really, what the fuck did I expect? I had fun doing that though. I was tired of her delusions (ironic) and how I had to pretend to ship them together because everyone else in the group did.

I succeeded. But at that point, it wasn't enough. I can't stand not being around him for even a day. 

We have plenty of interactions that I'm still not sure if they mean something or if I'm just giving it meaning. I honestly still feel like he was breadcrumbing me. These are a few of those:

* That time he randomly massaged my head while we were in class and I was writing down notes
* How he asks me for help all the time, even though his friends are more than capable of helping him
* Random middle of the night messages about non-academic stuff, though they only really last like 5 minutes and we don't talk much about anything else other than academics in real life
* The few times he offered to walk me home
* How his friends seem to act different when he's around me

It doesn't help that the terms ""delulu,"" and ""obsessed"" became popular and colloquialized because now when I say I think I'm delusional and obsessed, people think I'm joking. My actual friends still think I'm not serious about this and they laugh when I try to open up about it. They think he's my crush and they ship us. NO, I HAVE IT BAD AND MY PSYCHIATRIST APPOINTMENT IS TAKING TOO LONG. I fucking tried stalking the man back home. I TRIED TO STALK HIM BACK HOME.

I had a raging fit and meltdown when I found out he started dating this girl because I don't know why. Just to completely move on after a day. Literally the day after my meltdown, I went back to not giving a fuck about him because he's boring now. Until they broke up. 

I started writing this as I was sobbing because I can't have him with me alone. He's always with his friends. Unhinged, I know. He randomly called me in the middle of the night to talk about life and stuff. Then he actually invited me over to hangout the other day and I arrived there thinking it's just us, but nope, his friends were there. 

I hate how he has friends. I hate how he has family, even though his family aren't here. I hate how he interacts with other people in a daily basis. I hate how I know more about him than his friends do, yet we don't even talk much. 

I want to be the only person in his life. I don't even like this dude. I don't even wanna date this dude. The thought of being romantic with this dude repulses me. So what the fuck is this all about and why am I so obsessed with him?

I'm just getting worse and I try to manage my mental state, but I'm failing. I don't see my psychiatrist until next month.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/1az9rx6/i_became_a_derangedly_delusional_obsessed_stalker/,t2_uvzcoivji,2024-02-25 08:10:08,6
Have anyone tried social media detox?,"Hi, meron na bang nakapag-social media detox dito? Gaano katagal? How difficult it was for you and how did you cope?

That's why I want to social media detox. Aside from that, gusto ko rin alisin sa isip ko yung i-compare parte ng self o buhay ko sa mga nakikita ko sa social media. I want to make a new habit. I want to rekindle old hobbies. I want to take control of my life more.

problem ko now is i kinda feel cautious about going to therapy particularly because i specifically chose the psych center from recoms bc aside from being bading-friendly, most staff and ceo are part of the pink 🌸🌷movement tapos may mole naman pala sa group nila. would this be a factor for me to not feel comfy with her during sessions despite the credentials listed in her (female po preference na sinabi ko) provider profile.

How do I know if my boyfriend has mental health issues??,"I have been with my boyfriend on & off since 2019. And I’ve been under the impression he fakes his deaths for attention and he fakes going to the hospital.

Everything started in 2020. Every time we argue literally every single time we have an argument it ends up with “something happening to him.” Our first argument he said he got jumped by two guys and one guy punched him and he ended up with a slight coma and broken ribs. I believed him. Second misunderstanding , he said and his exact words (I don’t have the texts anymore, new phone) that after we argued he was sitting down and his head was hurting so bad (two weeks after his “coma”) that he actually passed out and died for about 9 minutes until the ambulance got there and that he had to stay in the hospital for three days. But the weird part about that is I seen his pay stub for that week. He still went to work, and also he was uploading videos. When I confronted him, he said it uploaded because it was still uploading when everything happened which I don’t believe to be true. So that’s when I was feeling weary about everything honestly. 

Literally the next week he said his mother had a heart attack and died and somehow came back. And she was in the hospital and honestly at this point I’m not sure if that’s true. This happened twice. Within the first 5 months of the year 2020. It seemed very odd to me, that something coincidentally happens every time we had a disagreement that I would not take the blame for. Yes!!! Every time I didn’t agree I was wrong and got all the facts BOOM something happens.

I started feeling very uncomfortable and I fell back from him alotttt. I never truly confronted him about how I feel like he’s lying because really I didn’t know how to so I avoided it. 

We began talking more again in about January of 2021, after a disagreement he’s mysteriously in the hospital, again! And this time, his “mother” is texting me. From his phone trying to convince me to not leave him alone etc. so now I want to see for myself. What are the chances that his “mom” has his phone while her son is “fighting for his life” has the time to text me and beg me not to leave her son. Texting exactly how he would text. Again, it wasn’t adding up to me. So now I start asking questions, what hospital is he in? Can you send me a picture? Can I visit? I was given a city of what hospital he was in, not even a name of the hospital, no I could not visit and no pictures. I even went as far as FaceTiming his phone, calling, no answer! How can your “mom” text me on your phone but can’t answer any calls but begging me not to leave? It makes no sense. I told her kindly me and his relationship is done. Because at that point it was getting a bit weird. How can I confront someone about them lying about being hospitalized?

Fast forward, 2022. I was going through a very dark path in my life and he contacted me to try to support me. I was a little weary about it but then again, I felt alone so I just went along with it and then it went south again. We had a disagreement, and honestly I knew he was going to say something was going to happen to him. So I waited for him to get home from work and I was already outside, in my car waiting. And I watched him walk inside his door just fine. In the morning he tells me he got jumped, by two guys and he can barely breathe. I WATCHED him walk inside of his home PERFECTLY FINE. That’s when it became clear he has been lying the entire time. But he doesn’t know that I know that. I play along every time. 

Then he made a comment after not too long ago after our disagreement that something bad is always happening to him after an argument and he really thinks I don’t know it’s all been a lie? But his problem is he only does this when he’s the one being told he’s wrong. He can attack me verbally tell me im not this that etc but once I have enough to set him straight it’s like he needs pity he feels like he can never lose and honestly at this point im a bit scared

He’s very sarcastic, he buys me gifts but keeps them at his house, so I would have to go to his house in order to receive them. He looked up my work place with only a name, and he makes weird jokes, like he’s watching me describing what I’m wearing etc , things I left on the floor of my room and all of this is very much creeping me out. I feel like he needs help and he has some sort of mental illness although I really don’t know which one.

Am I wrong?

And for the record, he does remember things that happen over a month ago. Even years when it’s him throwing it in my face he always remembers but reverse? He doesn’t recall.

Questions you should ask yourself before you self-diagnose with clinical depression,"**""Do I get sunlight everyday?""**

**""Am I drinking enough water?""**

**""Am I getting proper nutrition? (Or am I fueling my body with only junk?)""**

**""Am I getting enough sleep?""**

**""Am I consuming healthy content? (Or am I just stalking other people on social media?)""**

If you answered no to any of these, then it's not surprising that you are feeling depressed or anxious. You are depriving your brain of everything that it needs *(edit: what your brain needs to produce happy chemicals such as serotonin)* on top of having to deal with this already shitty world that we live in. 

Before creating a list in your head of all the things that you think will treat your depression, magsimula ka muna dito. These simple things will change how your brain functions and therefore will change YOUR LIFE. They're more important than you think so force yourself to do them. 

We live in a world that is extremely unhealthy for our minds and bodies. Fast paced content na walang substance, no reason to go out, profit driven businesses with fool-proof marketing plans that make you want and buy shit you don't only NOT need but is also extremely bad for you.

**You have to CONSCIOUSLY make good choices. Don't go with the flow kasi masisira talaga health mo.**

Hindi gaganda buhay mo sa career change o sa bagong kalandian. Instead of making life changing decisions that you think will treat your depression, **MAKE TINY GOOD CHOICES EVERY SINGLE DAY**. 

Start with these 5 things first: sun, water, good food, sleep, curating the content that you consume. 

Just these things can change EVERYTHING in your life. 

Most of the time, getting better isn't fueled by encouraging messages from friends, or validation from your family. It's forcing yourself every single day to have good habits and letting your brain and body heal. It's the hardest thing you have to do. Kahit mahirap. Even if you have to physically drag yourself out of bed. Force yourself so you don't have to deal with harder things in the future. Focus on the basics. Your life will slowly change.

Just try it, unfollow/mute some people on Facebook, give yourself compliments every time you get stuck in a negative thought, and get some sun tomorrow kahit 5 mins lang.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/onnz8q/questions_you_should_ask_yourself_before_you/,t2_735vynyq,2021-07-20 05:43:13,67
Tingin ko may mali sakin...,"(TW for safety: implied suicide, mentions of SA and stalking pero not elaborated)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Matagal na kong aware na hindi normal yung nararanasan ko, and yet nagdadalawang isip pa rin ako na magpacheck up ulit.

&#x200B;

Although kaya ko namang magfunction - and I've been doing better - sobrang apektado pa rin ng trauma yung karamihan ng aspeto sa buhay ko lalo sa relationships at self-image ko. That I am still considered 'behind'.

&#x200B;

For context, nagpacheckup na ko 3 years ago. Wala naman diniagnose sakin bukod sa 'symptoms'. Pero pinasok pa rin ako sa pharmacotherapy at counselling, which helped.

&#x200B;

Stinop ko lang altogether yung pagbalik ko sa psychiatrist saka pag-inom ng gamot after a few months kasi ayaw ako suportahan ng parent ko (kesyo dumedepende lang ako sa gamot, dahil na rin wala naman akong diagnosis). I also had a difficult time committing sa counselling so na-drop ko rin eventually.

&#x200B;

Pero nagtatrabaho na ko now so, naiisip kong bumalik kapag nakabwelo-bwelo. 

&#x200B;

Anyway, kahit man na alam kong valid feelings ko, may part pa rin sakin na nagdadoubt. Baka nag-iinarte lang ako, or baka need ko lang ng kausap?

&#x200B;

Pero saan ako maghahanap ng kausap na talagang makakaintindi / magtatiyaga sakin? Hindi lang ako basta makapag-open up. In fact, wala na kong makakausap bukod sa sister and boyfriend ko. But I can't rely on them all the time. Hindi normal na super cut off ako mula sa ibang tao... that even if I tried, I couldn't overcome. And people are so turned off by it. Literal na nakalimutan ko kung pano mag-open up at makipagsocialize. Every time that I do, inaanxiety agad ako. So much na ultimo magsshare lang ako ng maliit na bagay would send me into a spiral, and then I have to ground myself back. Then mag-ooverthink ako, and then mapapadasal na lamunin na lang sana ko ng lupa for the next few days.

&#x200B;

I've been thinking na bumalik din sa socmed at magreach out sa ilang acquaintances na naaalala ako, pero napapangunahan ako ng pag-ooverthink.

&#x200B;

In the end inisolate ko ulit sarili ko.

&#x200B;

Ewan ko. Di rin talaga pa ko nakakarecover mula sa mga nangyari back then. I already have emotional baggage dahil sa dysfunctional family ko. And when I thought life was beginning to be peaceful, na-SA pa ko, all while dealing with a stalker, tapos inabandona ako ng mga kaibigan ko during that year.

&#x200B;

Kung di lang talaga dahil sa kapatid ko, matagal na kong wala sa mundo.

&#x200B;

Bumabangon ako araw-araw dahil sinabi niya sakin na matutulog daw siya sa kama ko pag nawala ako. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Pero sa totoo lang matagal ko nang gustong sumuko.

&#x200B;

Faking it 'til I make it - kaso kaka-'fake' ko di ko na kilala sarili ko. There's two people living inside me, and di ko alam kung alin yung totoo.

&#x200B;

But anyway, aantayin ko na lang yung 13th month ko para makapag-avail ulit ng psych test. Wala namang masama kung gagawin ko yun, lalo na't sariling pera ko na rin naman ang gagamitin.

&#x200B;

Disappointed with how my first therapy session went,"I booked my first ever therapy session today. I was anxious but also excited kasi syempre this was my first. Also, I stalked her on FB beforehand and saw that she held talks and joined various events regarding mental health, so I expected a lot from her. I've been thinking about going to therapy for years already so I was expecting that this was gonna go well. I even saved money for it. My therapist was late for a few minutes, no biggie. But then, when she joined the call, it felt like she was in such a hurry, she didn't even try to establish rapport with me. Basically, her actions made me feel like a nuisance to her. Plus, I booked a 1-hour session but the entire session didn't even last 20 minutes. 

Right of the bat, she asked me the reason why I decided to go to therapy and of course, I was hesitant pa to tell her everything so I just told her the recent issue I've had to deal with which was my break up with my ex-girlfriend. I was bothered by how she handled the topic, like it was just surface-level talk, she didn't try to delve deeper into the issue and ask me about how I felt. I think that's the thing that bothered me most, she didn't ask enough questions. All she did was give advice about how I can handle the grief, but I wanted to know more, I wanted to know the root cause of why I am the way I am, or the reason why I'm always getting into toxic relationships. 

Another thing that bothered me was her choice of words; like how she said ""meron PA ba?"", instead of saying ""tell me more."" The ""PA"" felt like she was rushing to get this session done. Also, aside from her not asking enough, she also tends to assume; she assumed that I didn't have a good support system, when I didn't even say that. 

Just needed to let this out. Do you guys know any good therapists that charge 1,5k or below? Thank you so much.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/qypgjc/disappointed_with_how_my_first_therapy_session/,t2_4djzvmb4,2021-11-21 15:03:14,59
My soon-to-be ex is finally starting to accept our breakup,"Alam ko ang weird na medyo masaya ako pero sa totoo lang... Masaya ako kasi makakalaya na ko. 

Nagka-anxiety attack pa nga ako nung una, pero okay lang. Nakabawi din naman ako after a while. 

Sa totoo lang, ilang beses na ko nagpo-post dito sa Reddit sa sobrang stress at frustrated ko sa relationship na to. Kahit i-stalk nyo pa ko, maloloka kayo sa mga nangyari sa aming dalawa. 

Ilang beses na rin akong nagra-rant sa mga friends ko about this and alam ko ding nauumay at naaawa na din sila sa situation ko. Halos lahat ng counsellor at therapist ko sinasabi na iwanan ko na daw sya. 

I believe them tho. In the span of two years, I saw myself change into someone who had very low self esteem, was always angry and is very suspicious of other people as I forced myself to stay here. 

Alam ko na hindi na nakakabuti sa akin yung ganitong sama ng loob. Kahit kami pinag-usapan namin na kailangan ko syang i-let go para mag-grow kami. Pero somehow hindi ko talaga sya ma-let go habang nasa buhay ko pa sya. Aminado ako doon, hindi ko talaga ma-fulfill yung promise na yon.

Ever since hinagisan nya ko ng kutsilyo, sinigawan nya ko na lumayas ako sa sarili kong unit, at pinagbabato nya yung mga gamit ko sa pinto parang nawala na talaga lahat ng natitirang pagmamahal ko sa kanya. Nakikisama na lang talaha ako habang nagi-ipon ako ng pang-move out. 

Ilang beses ko na binring up yon na gusto ko na umalis pero di nya sineseryoso. Granted naman na minsan iniisip ko pa rin what if kasama sya sa next move ko... Pero alam kong trap yon kasi magaling syang magmukhang kawawa.

 Kunware onti lang daw pera nya pero akalain mo yon? Nakabuo ng 170k worth na bike. May dalawa pa syang bike sa building tapos 40% lang yung binabayad nya sa rent at utilities. Nakabili pa yan ng tatlong sapatos na branded (mga New Balance, Vans, etc.). Nakabili ng worth 8k na bag. Nakapag-upgrade ng phone. 

Samantalang ako? Puro bayad lang ng utang kasi ako sumalo sa living expenses namin. Halos lahat pinundar ko sa apartment. Yung furniture, yung ilaw, yung appliances. Pati yung unan at kama na hinihigaan nya. Wala syang pangkain? Sige kuha lang sya sa groceries. And take note ha: ako pa magluluto para sa kanya. Optional na lang kung lilinisin nya yung plato nya.

And that's just the finances. Eh pano pag hinimay natin yung proactiveness and sense of responsibility nya as a partner? Yung narcissism and opportunistic behavior nya as a person? Psshhhhhh baka nobela na to bhie

Kaya naman sometime around early October, mas pinush ko na yung sarili ko na talagang mag-move on kahit kami pa. And honestly, I think it was effective.

Okay lang pala matulog ako mag-isa araw-araw. Kaya ko naman pala matulog na hindi inaalala kung nasan na sya. 

Okay lang pala lumabas na hindi sya kasama. Halos sarili ko lang madalas kong kasama. Kaya ko naman pala i-date at i-enjoy yung sarili ko ng hindi nagpapadala sa galit na bakit hindi nya ko kayang ilabas ng ganito. 

Okay lang pala na i-hide ko na yung mga post at story ko. Oo nagtataka sya bat daw di ko nila-like mga post nya. Pero mga posts ko pinapasadahan nya lang. Tbh, aa sobrang wala syang pakelam with what goes on sa buhay ko aside sa role ko bilang girlfriend a.k.a. Substitute Mom™️, ni hindi nya napansin na inunfriend ko na sya two weeks ago. 

Okay lang pala kahit hindi na sya maging interesado sa mga trip ko. I love running and working out without him. I love watching Spiderman without him. I love painting and going to museums without him.

Iniisip ko nga kanina habang kumakain—wala naman palang nagbago. Okay naman ako. I survived it. From beginning to end. I looked out for myself kahit anong mangyari and that's all that matters. 🤍

NCMH E-Konsultasyon experience,"I just had my first consultation today with NCMH. Yay.

&#x200B;

For those who are curious, will share with you how my first e-konsultasyon happened. Kasi alam kong meron dito na mga curious and nagaalangan pa magpaconsult because they don't know what happens on your first consultation, so here ya go.

&#x200B;

A little caveat before I continue na I know some had negative experience sa NCHM consultations nila which is sad kasi never naman talaga dapat maging concern ng mga tao ang dismissive doctors in any medical field.

&#x200B;

Pre-Consultation:

1. I registered sa online google form nila. Be mindful of the time lang dahil open lang ang google forms nila ng 8am to 4pm, Mondays to Fridays (Except on holidays). Here is the link: [bit.ly/ncmhkonsultasyon](https://bit.ly/ncmhkonsultasyon)
2. I registered on a Monday afternoon. Mej marami lang tanong sa google forms pero basahin mo lang maigi, konting tiis lang and take your time. Walang automated email na submitted na ung form mo, it's normal. Ang unang marereceive mo na email from NCMH is the confirmation and your schedule.
3. Around 24hrs after I submitted my google form (Tuesday), naka receive ako ng text notification telling me na may confirmed schedule na ako that they sent via email.
4. What's in the email: your date and time of consultation, the link where you will use to conduct the consultation  and some reminders (like try dialing 15 mins earlier kasi baka mag cancel ung patient before you).
5. Mine was scheduled on Wednesday the same week. Mabilis yung naging process sakin. (And I hope for everyone din in the future)

&#x200B;

Consultation proper:

1. I used the link provided sa email. No need to install any apps, via browser mangyayare ung video call. Just remember to click ""Allow"" if prompted ng browser for the mic and camera access. Need daw po ng camera for the consultation as far as I can remember.
2. My doctor confirmed my name and age, and nagpakilala na sya sakin and asked for my understanding kasi 15 mins lang ang allowed time for session.
3. First question would be the reason kung bakit ka nagpaconsult and the conversation naturally flowed from there. She had comprehensive set of questions based on my answers. Most prominent questions were what did I feel, bakit ganun ung naging actions/thoughts ko, kung alam ko ba ung reasons and triggers.
4. We weren't able to dig in comprehensively sa session kasi 15 mins lang ang allotted time. My hunch is they focus their questions on more urgent matters that influence your quality of life.
5. After her set of questions, inexplain nya sakin kung ano ung urgent na need ma-address and what to expect sa future sessions (like addressing the triggers)
6. She scheduled me for a follow up session after 2-weeks, mentioned that she will give me medications that will be sent via email and gave me a caveat na baka hindi sya ung next na maging doctor ko in my next follow up but she assured me na it's okay and I just need to mention kung anong napagusapan namin to my future doctor. She had no diagnosis or did not mention what my issue might be. And hindi ko na din tinanong because I know na the session is not enough.
7. our session lasted for 18 minutes, nag overtime ako ng konti kasi madaldal ata ako. Nakinig lang sya and just evaluated. My doctor was very professional, not dismissive but not too empathetic din. Which is okay lang. Parang inevaluate lang talaga ako.

Post consultation:

1. Nareceive ko ung reseta ng medications after a few hours (via email) and nandun na din ung date ng next schedule ko. Hindi ko pa alam kung pano mangyayare sa next sched ko, tatawag nalang ako sa hotline nila kasi wala akong nakitang process for the follow up session. hehe.
2. Meron tips sa email on how to get your meds sa NCMH.
3. Expect na yung reseta is picture ng papel with the doctor's hand written notes of the meds and how to take them.

TIPS

1. Makikita mo sa link yung SURNAME ng doctor mo. Kung masipag ka mag stalk sa LinkedIn(if you're familiar) and if meron LinkedIn acct ung doctor mo, baka mahanap mo ang possible doctors mo based on the surname. Yun ginawa ako and I had an idea of who might be my doctor. Confirmed naman yung legitimacy ng stalking skills ko kasi tama ung nakita ko sa LinkedIn. LOL. Hindi muna ako mag memention ng full name ng doctor ko kasi idk if that might breach security protocols nila.
2. If wala ka nung declared ID's nila, and this is not confirmed sorry, but you might be able to use your school ID.
3. Keep a cheat sheet. Meron akong cheat sheet na ginamit. Wala yun universal format pero ang ginawa ko is nag enumerate ng reasons kung bakit feeling ko kailangan ko ng mental health assistance. After nun, bunalikan ko ung inenumerate ko at naglagay ako ng examples kada reason, tapos tuloy tuloy na sya for me.
4. I think it's normal na hindi mo masasabi lahat ng concerns mo kasi sobrang konti lang ng time na allotted at feeling mo kulang ung nasabi mo. But let's try to understand din na marami nakapila for consultation.

So ayun lang. Sana mas nagkaroon kayo ng courage to try and reach for professional help and na-ease ung curiosity nyo sa kung anong nangayare sa first session.

&#x200B;

Kung meron kayong tanong about the first consultation na hindi ko na-cover, feel free to comment. I'll try to answer. :)

&#x200B;

I might not be able to share anything related to the ff. but I'll try to be as helpful as I can:

* my condition
* how to get meds
* how to follow up for your reseta and schedule",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/u7yu20/ncmh_ekonsultasyon_experience/,t2_46j4e6hu,2022-04-20 23:16:30,10
Is my shrink crossing boundaries?,"So I’ve (F19) been going to the same therapist for about four years. Our relationship has honestly gotten really close, and I always enjoyed this. Seeing her was always a highlight of my week. 
But recently there are some red flags. 

The biggest one being her ghosting me when I moved to college. It literally came out of nowhere. We had plans to have two meetings the week that I moved. During the previous weeks before I had been meeting with her way more than usual,  because we were preparing for my move. She was pretty much the only person that I had to talk to, and she was very aware of this. I didn’t hear from her for atleast two weeks. And I recently found out the only reason she messaged me was because my mom emailed her and asked her to. 

It was so bizarre and detrimental to my mental health. We had such a close relationship and she just made it so clear that she was going to talk to me a bunch and when I hear from her I was shocked. 

And once I did hear from her it’s because she called me like 10 times and spammed my phone and left me a bunch of weird text messages. And when I didn’t answer she texted me my first and middle name with a period scolding me like my mom. And I have no idea how she even knew my middle name. And then she said “ I don’t want to sound to stalkerish but I have tomorrow off” then I tell her the day I can come back and meet with her to which she responded “ok 10 am you’re down. To be fair the stalking came out of a place of love when your mom reached out to me. 😂. Next time I’m driving myself to Ames to check on you .. take it one step farther”  like acting as if I ghosted her and she was worried about me instead of the other way around. 

I almost stopped seeing her after this happened but since then her energy had just been off. I feel like she’s there to hear my life gossip and not to be my therapist. I even told her what my biggest problem is and that I know it connects everything and she never brought it up again. I’ve been seeing her for four years yet haven’t even told her the beginning on my trauma because I feel uncomfortable. As soon as I get there she immediately like steers it to a conversation instead of like talking ab my issues. 

So now let’s talk ab the small things that have added up. I really want a professionals opinion as well to see if she was being normal or not. 
 
Just recently I told her I had been crying because my sisters on her period and it makes me pms bc I don’t have a period and our bodies still sync and then she starts saying she’s on her period too and just keeps saying it and saying I’m synced with her and making it weird. 

- She always told me she loved me and how I was her favorite and even would schedule me on Fridays which was her day off because “she loved me so much” 
 
- ever since I first met her she always asked me if I would come babysit her kids and I always tell her I hate babysitting and she still always brings it up and when said my sister likes to babysit she literally just llike changed the subject

- she tells me about her infertility issues and asks me where I would send my kids to school all the time so she can figure out where to send hers (adopted if ur wondering bc I mention infertility ) 

- one time she brought her kid and he sat on the floor between us and talked the whole session and I just played with him 

- wanted my new address to send me a fidget gift even tho I saw her in person 
 
- always says she’ll drive yo my house if I ghost her ( 2 1/2 hours away ) 

- one time we spent the whole session putting up her sign outside",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/yze0br/is_my_shrink_crossing_boundaries/,t2_f55wxpew,2022-11-19 23:10:15,14
Mental health and Job opportunities,"One of the reasons why I'm postponing my appointment with a psychiatrist/ psychologist is because I'm afraid that if get diagnosed, that's going to be on my record forever. I'm not sure pero will that affect my chances of getting the job I want? So far, even with an untreated anxiety nagagawa ko naman yung trabaho ko. Pero habang tumatagal, lalong lumalala na minsan ayoko nalang lumabas ng room, ayoko nalang pumasok, ayokong bumangon dahil ang dami kong iniisip at nararamdaman.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/d17ckv/mental_health_and_job_opportunities/,t2_4bm39fut,2019-09-08 14:08:39,7
