I stalked my ex and regretted it.,"I saw him showering his new gf with gifts I asked him when we‚Äôre together. I saw him posting his new girl thanking him for all the gifts he gave her. There‚Äôs a heavy feeling about it. I‚Äôve been contemplating if I‚Äôll check his profile or not. But I did and I regret it.

I‚Äôm happy for him. But I somehow wish that he did that too when we‚Äôre together and I didn‚Äôt have to beg for it. But anyways, he cheated on me for her while we‚Äôre together anyways but just doesn‚Äôt want to admit it. He said it‚Äôs my fault that he had to hurt me and say all those awful things to me. He loves to shove it to my face how better she is and how much of a perfect boyfriend he is to her. 

But I am genuinely happy that I don‚Äôt have to live with all the manipulation and gaslighting from our relationship anymore.


Just one of my relapses I guess.

Edit: Yes, receiving gifts was my love language but di ko sinasabi sa ex ko kasi na fefeel bad ako pag makaka tanggap ako ng gifts kasi feeling ko utang na loob sya. And he knows that but tinatanggap ko mga gifts na binibigay nya coz ayaw ko ma feel bas sya and sabihin na di ko naaappreciate gift nya. But at the end of our relationship, sinumbat nya din sakin lahat ng nabigay nya and even asked me to return his gifts.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/15lz4z2/i_stalked_my_ex_and_regretted_it/,t2_a866hjhhq,2023-08-09 08:10:52,292
What stalking gets you,"I feel sick. I can‚Äôt even finish my brunch, the first proper meal I‚Äôm going to eat in 4 days.

I just stalked his account (even though it‚Äôs not healthy for me) and found out he re-followed the girl he badmouthed and unfriended for me. I mean, expected na siguro yun‚Äîwe‚Äôre no longer together and he knew her longer than he knew me. Ang off lang sa feeling because after basically calling her a ‚Äúhoe‚Äù and reassuring me it was the right decision to cut ties, kakaibiganin niya ulit. He‚Äôs so full of shit. 

Although I long for him (I don‚Äôt like feeling like this but we dated for quite some time, it‚Äôs hard to forget him), I can‚Äôt deny the fact he‚Äôs a red flag beneath his nerdy exterior. I‚Äôm glad we‚Äôre over. I deserve so much better than his receding hairline and inflated ego despite looking like a fucking mole rat. I hate how I still get bullied for dating him. 

Anyways‚Äîdon‚Äôt stalk your exes, guys.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/15f2ukf/what_stalking_gets_you/,t2_b2yg5o1sw,2023-08-01 13:08:38,14

"Ngayon na lang nga ako nagka-crush ulit, makikita nya pang ini-stalk ko sya sa LinkedIn","Lupa, ako'y lamunin mo naaaa. Kung kailan naman ako nagiging all smiles at bubbly dahil may crush na ulit ako, doon ko pa madi-discover na di pala naka-private mode kapag nagv-view ako ng profile sa LinkedIn! Nakakahiyaaaaaaa. Pero at least na-discover kong career oriented sya at marami na ring pinagdaanan tulad ko. Pero nakakahiya pa rin!

I still stalk them,"I‚Äôm fairly new to the dating scene. As an introverted guy who can be selfish and self-centered at times, I thought that longing for someone was not for me. But I was wrong, and started using dating apps. It ruined me tbh haha, dito ko nalaman na hindi ako kapili-pili, which sucks. 

Anyway, I met these 2 guys on the scene. Yung isa noong around June and Isa noong September. Both lasted for months, both ended up on meet-ups, both also ended up ghosting me. Walang label sa dalawang yan, but I definitely thought we had something special. June guy is already in a relationship and Sept guy seems to be living his best life. Paano ko nalaman? I still stalk them. I already cut them off, deleted our pictures and conversation. Pero may times na bigla akong na cucurios what‚Äôs new with their lives and kapag nalaman kong masaya sila, naiinis ako. I know what I‚Äôm doing is unhealthy, I try not to think or overthinking about it. Siguro, I just wanted to rant these things here. 

Nakakainis lang talaga, parang ako yung pinaka apektado in all of this. Promise, I don't feel anything romantic or good na to them, it's just that ang unfair lang how happy they are right now habang ako eto, still picking up the pieces of what ol dating did to me. I‚Äôm trying my best to not think about them, and even be happy for them. I hope that someday, they won‚Äôt cross my mind at all.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/18mb11t/i_still_stalk_them/,t2_j0savfhan,2023-12-20 04:03:07,2
Do men stalk socials too?,"It's usually the norm for the ladies to stalk someone's socials. That's kinda how they were labeled ""FBI's"". Naghahanap ng dahilan para umiyak sa madaling araw (lol), or sometimes to look for peace of mind. Gotta tell you, iba gut feeling ng mga babae talaga. It might sound ridiculous at first pero magugulat ka how they find out their partner's well kept secrets.

I'm curious though. Nangsstalk din ba mga men? Hindi casual stalk na checking recent posts, stories, and the obvious ones ha. FBI levels pinag uusapan.

Like iisa isahin nyo din ba ung following list nila, titignan nyo din ba yung liked tweets sa Twitter, kaya niyo bang ifigure out kung may ""link"" ba between her and the person she recently followed?

Genuinely curious. How creative can men be sa pag stalk? Haha",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/ve76ut/do_men_stalk_socials_too/,t2_kx65bpie,2022-06-17 15:10:23,32
I stalked my Exes (ngayon lang uli),"Dahil bored ako and I felt a bit bitter for being still single this Feb... napag tripan ko na silipin mga social media ng exes ko. 

Ex-Fiance > mukhang tyanak yung anak nya lol. Sorry ang sama ko. Napa ""Thank You Lord ako at hindi kami nagkatuluyan nito"". 
Maganda naman wife nya pero nakuha talaga ni ex yung itsura nung bata eh. 
Nabulag talaga ako sa pag-ibig nung naging kami nito. 

TOTGA > may konting kirot sa puso. Masaya sya. Laki ng tinaba nya naging majimbo na sya lol. Obvious naman na alagang alaga sya ni wifey. Sincerely happy for them. 

First BF > napaka private ng socmed nya. Picture ng anak profile pic. In fairness, sya pinaka gwapo sa lahat ng ex ko at kita naman sa anak nya. Maganda talaga lahi nila. 
Yung dating bad boy nung high school na lagi sa guidance counselor at madaming bisyo, ngayon HS teacher na. Umayos naman ang buhay at mukhang nagsisimba na. 

Yung recent ex ko naningil sa akin > sad boy pa din. Buti na lang hindi ako sobrang nagpaka tanga dito sa taong to.

Moral lesson: pag nalulungkot for being single, stalk mo rin ex mo. You'll realize that the universe is protecting your heart. Enjoy this season and savor every moment thereof.

Stalked my ex‚Äôs FB and I felt happy,"Naalala ko siya bigla today and naiyak ako ulit dahil namiss ko siya. 6 months na kaming hiwalay (he broke up with me) at no contact na rin. Inistalk ko yung Facebook niya to see if he‚Äôs with someone else na. Wala naman akong nakitang bakas na may dinedate na siya ulit although alam ko naman na lowkey siyang tao.

Nagpalit na siya ng profile pic. His eyes seemed happy and he‚Äôs looking good which made me feel fine. I happened to scroll down more at nakita ko yung shared video niya na kinakantahan siya sa office noong birthday niya. He looked confused (parang di sure kung ano irereact) but I can see the happiness in his eyes. It made me feel happy seeing him like that. Gumaan yung puso ko.

I could have felt sad the fact na masaya siya kahit wala ako sa buhay niya pero otw na yata ako sa acceptance. Ang importante buhay siya (hindi na sana suicidal) at kung yung break up nga namin yung turning point sa buhay niya, sana mapunta siya sa tamang landas.

I‚Äôm hoping for his genuine happiness and peace of mind. Kahit hindi na ako yung dahilan at yung kasama niya at present.

"Everytime I stalk my ex, my mood goes down.","Kakahiwalay lang namin this month, natapos kasi she couldn't see this continuing yung relationship namin. She found ""Icks"" in me, personal preferences na hindi naman red flag, something na she doesn't prefer in a personal partner.

Looking back, I was drained by her but ignored it since I love her. Na realized din niya na ginagawa niya akong backburner, she was so thoughtful na naisip niya pa yun. Pero yeah, I guess it's for us.

I promised her we would still maintain connection pero ewan, para saan pa nga ba. I'm not that type of person na would block my exes. We still follow each other pero naka mute na mga stories and posts niya sakin.

Pero nagiging habit ko na if sobrang saya ko, I'd stalk her para di naman laging masaya. Then bang, I found her chatting someone and asking na pili daw siya ng ipipick for Ig posts, something na she'd do to me back then.

This time, I think di ko na gagawin for my benefit. I might block her.

why do men stalk girls in public?,"pansin ko lang mapa mall or kalsada, you probably have been stalked by a man at least once if you're a girl. you're lucky na nga if once lang nangyari sayo. pero di ko lang talaga gets? what do they get out of following you around kahit alam nila na napansin mo na? 

and from exp, the men who follow you don't look creepy naman. they seem to look like men with stable jobs. 

if i feel i'm being followed i switch opposite directions just to see if a man will switch as well. sometimes they follow you parin, sometimes they drop the stalking. tho it still shocks me na some will be bold enough to let you know they're stalking you. 

nkakairita lang as a girl. paano na if you commute to and from work everyday the chances of the stalking will likely increase talaga. imagine how that affects u on a daily basis. don't u just wanna KAM minsan haha",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/17ei35t/why_do_men_stalk_girls_in_public/,t2_4zal0ope,2023-10-23 19:26:36,1
3days withdrawal stage from stalking my ex and the girl he cheated me with,"It's been almost a year since our breakup. Pero now lang ako nakapag decide to stop stalking them. Before naman, ganito rin, mag stop ako pero may relapse tapos iche check na naman sila. Iiyak na naman.

Ang tagal na rin pala. But it seems like it was just 3 or 2 months ago. The pain isn't that hurful anymore pero andito pa rin. 

I just realize na time can heal wounds but it depends on your actions din on how long it can heal you. Finally, I'm deciding to let go.

Sana totoo na to. Sana di na ako ma tempt kumustahin sila and icheck if nakarma na ba. Haha! Or  icheck kung gano sila kasaya at the cost of mine. Sigh.

I also heard na you can only blame someone for the hurt they caused you but not everything, ible blame mo na lang sa kanila. Ayokong mangyari na malungkot pa rin ako for a long time and ang reason, ganun pa rin. It's time to move on.

I'm leaving that restaurant na. Sana kayanin ko. Pagod na pagod na akong maging malungkot. I'm hoping for the best.

Is it too bad ba na I keep stalking the girl he cheated on me with?,"I‚Äôm insecure talaga, tbh. I grew up being bullied kasi i‚Äôm a bit chubby na ever since baby pa ako and na instill na sa akin na I‚Äôm not attractive bc of that. Now, I have been with a couple of guys and girls (trying to see kasi where I would be comfy with) and some of them may cheating talaga involved but I really got stuck with this one ex. For context, I was in the healing stage when this guy I met sa dating app started na manligaw sa akin, he tried to win me for like 4 months and finally I said yes, so sa loob ng 4 months na yon kinuwento ko sa kanya ang lahat ng reasons ng failed RS ko and most them is cheating nga, so yun he promised na hindi nya raw gagawin and I shud just trust him. About 1 or 2 weeks after naging kami I saw a notif on his phone with his ex‚Äôs name, kinuha ko phone nya kesyo makiki log in ako, he tried to grab it back and kinda furious but I was able to open the chat and there, parang akong tinabunan ng lupa, yung feeling na ang sikip sikip tas di ka makahinga ng maayos. Matagal na pala sila magkausap, ang pinakamasakit sa nabasa ko was he tried to get back w/ her and to think sinagot ko na siya. Bumalik laha ng trauma ko, nasaktan ako ng sobra kasi I gave it all, I loved him with more than I could give, I did end the rs pero he asked for another chance and ofc tanga at marupok tayo edi pinagbigyan pero what stuck talaga sa akin is from that moment on, I keep visiting the girl‚Äôs socials, like every freaking second I am stalking her and idk, i think it fed my insecurity so much. Wala na kami ni guy for more than a year na but heto pa rin ako stuck sa pag sstalk sa ex nya. 

I know this is weird, idk if I need professional help kasi naging routine ko na eh, my day will not be completed if I won‚Äôt visit her social media accnts.

"I created a dummy account in order to stalk my ex, ended up loving myself","I was at a period of time where I went through a really bad breakup. Both sides have their own faults. I was being extremely harsh at myself as well, owing up to my own shortcomings being the reason of it all. The other side's friends, of all people, are the ones telling me I should move on. That I should not come back. That it was my ex's fault talaga. My ex was toxic, but I didn't want to accept it.

But I was still clinging on. And I know that I shouldn't.

So what did I do? I made a dummy account. At first it was to extract information from my ex. Chat ko siya and be like yo anyare sa ex mo blah blah blah. I'm evil, I'm paranoid, and I'm just the type of person who doesn't want to be in the dark. My ex has a tendency to befriend anyone online. But then, an idea popped up. What if I chat myself and make my ex jealous by posting it online?
Genius! I thought to myself. Baka balikan pa ako. 
So I started chatting myself with the dummy account. I felt like I was the lowest of the low, chatting myself. It started out with introductions, you know, para realistic.

Then it developed.

From good mornings to good nights and then into good lucks. It felt... real? Even as I was orchestrating this whole thing, I felt better everyday that I chat myself. I didn't even screenshot nor posted any pictures online. It came to a point that what I was doing was not for revenge, but it was for my own self improvement.
I was cheering myself on, saying stuff like don't give up, keep moving forward. All under the guise of a dummy account.
I was severely depressed beforehand, but now I could look at tomorrow with a smile on my face. Opened my eyes that I deserve better.

Tama nga sila. Learn to love yourself first. Mahirap siyang lunukin. For me, it had to come from the illusion of an imaginary potential lover. It might be different for other people, and it's quite unorthodox yung ginawa ko. And I had really bad intentions at the start. But I wouldn't be in such a good place mentally and emotionally if it weren't for that.
Wala lang. I just wanted to share. Baka makatulong sa iba who might be going through the same things I went through haha

To anyone who's struggling, kaya mo yan. I believe in you.

I'm (21F) still stalking my ex (24M) even though I'm already in a relationship with someone else,"

I feel like it's wrong. I know it's wrong. Especially that my current boyfriend has been nothing but good to me. I feel guilty each time but I still can't help it. Whenever I go on facebook, after seeing all of my notifications, I always unconsciously click the search bar to type out his name. It's like my fingers have a mind of their own, I don't know. This is everyday, by the way. I want to know how his life's been going, who he's dating... heck, I even look at who reacts in all his posts. It's been a year since we broke up and I thought I had moved on from him. I've only been stalking him since three months ago. Ever since I found out from a common friend that there was rumor of him dating a new girl. 

I even convinced myself that maybe I was just curious. That by the time I'd see him post about the girl and learn what she looks like, I'll be over it. But then the day came that they started going public and all his posts were just about her. The girl was pretty, VERY PRETTY. Now my ex isn't entirely that good looking but he's a tall basketball player so that must have been a huge factor... But anyway, I never stopped stalking after that. 

Now he's not the only one I stalk, but his new girlfriend as well. It has already become a habit and I really feel awful.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/14qguok/im_21f_still_stalking_my_ex_24m_even_though_im/,t2_946zyxkj3,2023-07-04 22:33:19,0
"She stalked me and I got creeped out. We stopped talking, and then I miss her.","I need to harden up so this doesn't happen again.

I met a lovely woman sa isang dating app. I am the type of person that doesn't message first on 99% of my matches, but this time I messaged her on my admiration for her boots. We both own a pair of Dr. Martens boots. She said she bought hers on Europe. OFW kasi siya. I always looked up to OFWs. We moved to socmed by her request. She wanted to talk in Messenger, while I wanted to talk in IG. She gave her real account while I gave her a dummy account. Sobrang private ko lang talaga siguro.

We went back and forth and I found out that nakakagaan ng loob siya kausap. I decided to lower my guard and let her in sa walls ko, she did the same. I would always update her on my plans for the day and she would do that as well.

I've always looked forward chatting with her everytime I woke up in the morning. Nocturnal ako habang siya morning person. I changed my sleep sched. so we can talk more. I've been a nocturnal for years.

I attended an event, I informed her I won't be able to chat with her for a few days and she didn't mind. She didn't think any of it. Wala siyang ""tamang hinala"". I attended the event and messaged her after the event concluded. My preparation for the event, the actual event, and my pahinga took 5 days. I messaged her again and we continued talking like nothing happened.

She would always say that I look good. Walang araw niyang hindi nasabi 'yan. I would reply na sa photos lang 'yan, and not irl. She insisted. She also said na ang ganda ng boses ko, pang radyo daw. Habang ako delete ng delete ng mga audio recordings ko because I find them cringe. I rarely get compliments and hers really stuck.

I would always compliment her on being a traditional woman. She is someone who is saving up her virginity until marriage. That's something I truly admire. The mindset and traits she has might be rarer than actual diamonds nowadays. I made sure she knows that, I would reassure her everyday that she is special.

She knows my past. I know hers. Tinanggap niya ako kahit I had a lot of sexual partners in the past whie she never had any. She disliked talks about sex and I found that to be a breath of fresh air from the sexting and flirting that I used to do. 

I was surprised that women like her still existed, and I was even more surprised that she swiped right on me. She deleted and uninstalled her dating app account after talking with me. I just uninstalled.

One day, she told me na naaattach na daw siya. I had no reaction because wala naman talaga akong marereact. Blanko ako, if you get me. Looking back, she would always send her pics tapos wala talaga akong masabi. Minsan nababago ko pa topic kasi wala talaga akong masabi. As in wala talaga like, okay picture 'yun. Bumabawi naman ako sa appreciation ng ugali niya.

Dami ko nga nakwento sa kan'ya, kahit 'yung thought na gusto ko bumili ng Bajaj RE para maigala ko parents ko around their province. She liked the idea. Madami din naman siya nakwento, including her time sa ibang bansa, her impressions on foreigners ganun. Nakita ko din mga bike na binili niya for her father and brother, and mga motor nila. Everyday was a wholesome day chatting with her and I liked it.

Nafafall na daw siya, at this time I was starting to get attached as well. Hindi ko lang nasabi. I don't remember why hindi ko nasabi, maybe I wanted to keep it to myself muna? 

She was different from the majority of women na nakilala ko. She was truly non-sexual. If she feels horny daw, tinutulog daw niya or nililibang niya sarili niya. She is 26 at she still have the same mindset! I admired that on her talaga. Unlike most of my past encounters where they would get steamy sa chats and send thirst traps and provoking photos, she never did any of those. I've truly met a diamond, as if nanalo ako sa lotto.

She knows I have businesses but I never told her the names. I always kept it private. Gusto ko kasi bukod ang business life ko sa personal life. That being said, my social medias are private. I have a Facebook account na gamit ko bilang admin ng page and I use the account and page to advertise my businesses. That account used to have a lot of Facebook friends but my depression wanted me to delete my socmeds pero I did not. I instead removed everyone from my friends list and I joined Facebook groups instead. I would post there or I would post sa Marketplace. Ganun na lang point ng FB ko. That's the next best thing to deletion. I know some of you will relate.

At this point she never knew my real name. I never asked hers, she just gave me her first name. She didn't ask for my last name either.

Lagi niya ako inaaya magmeet and I would always decline. Hindi na kasi ako talkative in person and I was scared that I will look uninterested sa kan'ya pero ganun na talaga ako in person. I know she can tell base sa how I look on stolen photos, I never smiled and I would have an empty stare. Looking back, maybe I should've met her; so I can hug her and make her feel appreciated and loved.

Maybe she got curious or maybe she got bored. She decided to try and find my name on Facebook. My name is probably on the top 10 most common names and yet she found it! She sent me a screenshot of my profile but my dumbass brain and emotion thought it was so creepy that I was so turned off at the moment. I told her that I found that to be creepy and at the time I never really fully recovered from it. She regretted doing that and she said her goodbyes.

I miss the person.

I like Reddit kasi nailalabas ko 'to. Even my closest friends doesn't know about this. I am the type of person that likes to keep everything a secret; dito ko lang nailalabas kasi I am anon here.

I pray for her success in life. I pray that she finds someone who appreciates her and will never take advantage of her. I wish her the best.

I always stalk the exes/previous flings of my Boyfriend on their SocMed accounts to the point that it has become an obsession.,"I developed my stalking skills from my previous relationship.
My ex had a gf and they lasted for 7 yrs. and since that's a first for me at that time, I got insecure and curious for the first time about his ex. I started stalking her fb almost everyday. I also discovered that they had a shared fb account. I tried to guess the username and the password, and to my surprise I was able to open that fb account although there's not much in there. I continuously did this for years and couldn't stop myself from stalking and also started this unhealthy habit of comparing myself to her and even showing her account and pics to my friends and colleagues so I can gossip about her. I even asked my friends to follow her private ig account so I can stalk her. I was also sub consciously copying her. From her style, her shoes, bag, hair, clothes, hobbies, interests, and even the events and places that she has been to or frequenting. I had this eagerness and competitiveness in me to be like her or even more than her, to surpass her.

Fast forward now, even though I have a new Boyfriend I still keep on doing the same thing to his exes and even previous flings. Now it's not just on fb, but even in ig, and tiktok. I was able to search their usernames and checks their account everyday. It's like, checking has been a part of my routine already. I even created a dummy acc dedicated to stalking and now I even added their colleagues as well. I couldn't help myself and always check their accounts. I just found myself copying their clothing style, and interests again. It‚Äôs like a cycle, an unhealthy habit, an obsession that I couldn‚Äôt stop. It‚Äôs like Cady‚Äôs obsession with Regina George!",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/164k9l8/i_always_stalk_the_exesprevious_flings_of_my/,t2_ewtqrohb,2023-08-29 22:39:18,6
Told a guy thet his gf is cheating just to mess with him. Turns out na totoo pala.,"May naka argue akong guy sa isang post sa fb.  We argued back and forth and when he can't refute my argument he started attacking me with ad hominem rebuttals. I stalked him and it just so happened na nakatira sya sa same city as to where I live and so is his gf.  I stalked his gf and we have 2 mutual friends so I hatched a plan to poison his mind at gawin syang praning. I sent him a screenshot of his gf's acc along with censored 2 mutuals telling him na I know his gf(lie obviously)but they both didn't know me. Along with a message na ""kaya ka niloloko ng jowa mo kase ang hina ng utak mo"". Di na sya nag reply sakin after I told him that. Half a week later I got curious and proceeded to stalk him again. Dun ko na nakita yung mga sadboy posts nya along with screenshots ng convo ng gf(ex) nya at nung affair partner ni girl. Apparently its been going on for 7-8 months and he doesn't have any ideaüò≠.

I'm ugly but I have a stalker üò≠,"
I feel like I'm being stalked, even though I may not be conventionally attractive. Okay, maybe not 'ugly,' but I'm not exactly pretty either. I'm mid, kinda fat and just plain and boring. My brother's friend is stalking me ü•≤and at first, I don't really care  thinking it was a prank. But it won't stop; my clothes are missing, and he sends pictures of them at his place. With my low self-esteem, I can't believe I'm being stalked. Like I can't accept he stalks someone like me. Okay I know attractiveness isn't a factor, but why me? I'm not pretty, rich, or interesting.

I don't know how to react at this point. I've told him to stop multiple times but he won't stop. Sometimes he stops. Sometimes he hangs out with my brother, and I can tell he's taking pictures of me. I overthink a lot thinking he wants to harm me. The point is I don't feel safe. He acts like a normal, funny friend around my brother, but online or when he's looking at me, his personality changes. I need help telling my parents, especially my brother, without them laughing at me or thinking I'm delusional. They might find it hard to believe that his friend, who seems okay and kinda hot (according to them) would stalk or bully me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/17yuqsi/im_ugly_but_i_have_a_stalker/,t2_mnetyibe4,2023-11-19 18:58:53,102

Bakit ang tatapang ng mga kabit?,"My boyfriend of 8 years (now ex) cheated on me.

I just recently found out that the kabit (security guard) posted on tiktok 3 months ago, pictures of them ng ex (engineer) ko while during that time, kami pa ng ex ko. She placed a caption ""friend ‚ù§Ô∏è"", while holding his hand, being intimate on the beach at sa mga inuman nila. When I found out about the affair, she told me na hindi siya natatakot na mapahiya sa workplace nila kasi alam daw ng lahat ng workmates nila ang relationship nila ng ex ko. Gusto pa nya harapin ko siya para mag usap kami. Sabi pa nya, yung ex ko daw una nag approach sa kanya at nadamay lang daw siya.

She was called out by my friends, family at family ng ex ko but what she did was she changed her profile pic sa socmed and showed to us that they are now living together with my ex, showing her hickey sa cleavage nya. She kept sharing patama posts towards me sa socmed.  She told me ang sarap daw ng t\*te ng ex ko at ikakasal na daw sila. Alam nya na ayaw ng fam ng ex ko sa kanya. Sabi pa ng mom ng ex ko, kapag makikita nya ang babae, sasabunotan nya ang babae. That girl didn't even show the slightest respect to my ex's family. What's worse, tinolerate ng nanay ng babae ang cheating. The nanay messaged na hinay hinay lang daw sa bunganga ko, kasi kahit ganyan ang anak nya, wala daw silang inaapakan na tao. Wow! Well, deserve naman talaga ng anak nya lahat ng masasakit na salita after disrespecting me and everyone else.

Nakakasuka isipin na may mga ganitong tao sa mundo. She's so proud na she started as a sidechick at ngayon, official na sila ng ex ko. Proud homewrecker. She's tagging me sa socmed na ex nalang daw ako, making fun of my mental health condition and kinalimutan na daw nila ako (lol while stalking me everday). Can't wait talaga how the universe will fuck them up after what they did to me.

BF has been following a lot of girls on Instagram,"Just found out earlier that my BF has been following a lot of girls in instagram. I'm not the kind of girl na nangingialam sa social media nya because I value his privacy. I noticed na dumadami ang followings nya and my curiosity got the better of me so I used a third party app to check who he recently followed and I was so disappointed that he followed a lot of girls. I hope this will not lead to microcheating.

I don't really mind if he followed insta models, what made me upset was when he followed normal girls na with in our area lang. I can't open this up to him since this is considered stalking.

This hurt me a lot and he's giving me reasons to overthink na siguro may ibang ka chat na ito. I really hope he's not messaging those girls he followed on his insta. I trust him, I really do.

well, ngl this girl is really cool (from what i have observed: pretty face (fits the beauty standard today), fit/petite & independent). i badly wanted to be like her that's why i did everything i've never done before just to please him and it came to the point that he found out me stalking this girl's account and made him angry at me. we talked about it, he said he was uncomfortable with it because stalking is creepy (which my contradicting ass agrees).  i apologized profusely but i never said why i did it, he did not asked further too and just said forget about it.

DFA data encoder added me on FB,"Had my appointment the other day. The encoder was really friendly and accommodated my request to retake my photo since I wasn't happy with my RBF but anyway hours after the appointment I receive a friend request with about 30 mutual friends, all from high school. The profile is locked so I couldn't really stalk. My sister searched the name though and the results showed posts with location at the DFA satellite office in our city.

A few days later, I was having dinner with my friends when I saw said data encoder. I told my friend he looked familiar (since I stalked his tagged posts) and I made the connection so I showed her the friend request. My very quick friend clicked accept (boundaries, I know, but all in good fun; I laughed along with my other friends).

But minutes after that happened, he chatted Hi :). Under other circumstances, I would've engaged (jowang-jowa na rin ako).

Why do I turn into an ugly person when I fall in love with someone?,"I feel like nababaliw na talaga ako. I love someone for almost a year now. I already confessed but he turned me down because all he wanted was to be friends and to only have fun. A part of me wants to stop what we have but I chose to stay kasi siya lang yung safe space ko plus I love him. 
I can't deny na he's helped me a lot especially when I have mental breakdowns and relapses a lot. Pero I also feel na parang I'm turning into someone that I don't like. I find myself spending so much time stalking this guy. Because I knew he had something with someone, I even stalked his friends trying to know who that is. I know it sounds so crazy but I couldn't control myself and the urge to know everything since he's far from me. But he did say it's alright for me to stalk him. Still, I don't like this version of me.
I also compare myself with the girls that I knew he had a thing with before. Sometimes I would try and copy stuff like their hobbies or what they wear.
Most of the time I'd have trouble sleeping because I'm thinking of him. His absence makes me so so sad and I have to sleep almost all the time with a heavy heart and an overthinking mind. Only when I am with him can I ease these tho not until he would talk about his flings, exes, and even female friends.
I hated who I am right now. I feel so ugly and I just wanna puke. But it's so hard cutting stuff with him. 
I try to fill myself with other things. Trying other hobbies or ibaon ang sarili ko sa mga lsro Pero at the end of the day siya parin Nasa isip ko. 
I don't want to be this obsessed and toxic but I am one and I hate it.

"today, I accidentally logged off his account.","To preface, throwaway account because I'd hate it if anyone realized it's me. I'm a girl. And I've been obsessively insecure of my bf's ex for 5 years.

He told me stories about her. She has the life I wanted. And even if she's already my bf's ex, I always ended up being compared to her. His family likes her and stays friends with her. She's friends with his sisters and his cousins, He compared me to her while making love, how she moves better than I do. I'm not the most sociable person, but I do try my best. And despite everything, it wasn't enough. 

I became obsessed with her because half of me wants to be her, and half of me wants to see her fail. But I don't have the guts to do that. I stalked her using my bf's account because they stayed friends on Facebook. 

My bf learned about my stalking and unfriended his ex on Facebook. He got mad at me because I resorted to such behavior, but he also said sorry that he made me feel that way. He's been a good person to me ever since. 

But my obsession did not stop there. 

Until one day, 2 years ago, I tried brute force hacking her bf's account. And I got in. I was shaking. I didn't know how but I got in one of the closest accounts to her. 

I have a spare phone where I kept her bf's account and I have been stalking her every chance I get. Reading through their messages, looking through their photos, watching. 

For a while my obsession was satisfied. I knew what she was doing through this account. They changed their password a few times but never sent it through the messages. But they never logged off the accounts from where it was logged in. So it stayed logged in on my phone. I can't log it out after that tho. I tried stopping sometimes. Tried not to look at the account and stop myself from wanting to know what's going on with her life. But I can't. My mind doesn't want to stop trying to know stuff about her. 

Then today, after 2 years, I accidentally logged his account off. 

I've been thinking, I guess it's for the better. Losing a way to know what she's doing might just make me stop my obsession with her. Maybe this time I can finally stop myself. 

I don't know what I will do now I guess? I think I'm experiencing some kind of withdrawal. 

I should really seek a therapist.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/12vi9qr/today_i_accidentally_logged_off_his_account/,t2_9s9vf8h8g,2023-04-23 04:31:13,1

my stages of going thru heartbreak pt 2,"baby steps:
in the one month of trying to heal, i‚Äôm proud to say that i have started to slowly accept the fact that hindi na yun babalik. inalis ko na yung mga binigay niya sa akin and kept it in a box. deleted the screenshots of our cute messages. changed my phone case where i kept the dried petals from the flowers he‚Äôs given me. stopped wearing the clothes that remind me of him. i did not do all that in the same day or consecutively. they were done days or weeks apart. whenever i just felt ready. 

it comes in waves:
eto talaga yung pinaka frustrating na part. minsan i feel kind of free from him kasi those tiktoks don‚Äôt make me sad anymore pero minsan ang sakit parin talaga like it was the first day. im looking forward to the time na my heart won‚Äôt beat so fast out of anxiety when i hear his name from my friends or when i see pictures of him with them. i have slowly accepted the fact na ganun talaga. sometimes okay ako, sometimes hindi but that‚Äôs completely okay and part of the process. minsan gaslighter din ako sa sarili ko eh so di talaga ako sure if okay ako minsan.  just because you were triggered doesn‚Äôt mean you haven‚Äôt healed some. it takes time to repair wounds.

bad habits:
despite my baby steps, i still fall into very bad habits. exhibit a: stalking. minsan i would wonder if he‚Äôs having a hard time as much as me and i would stalk. it looks like he‚Äôs doing okay and i would be sad na he isn‚Äôt he having a hard time like i am. disclaimer lang, im happy that he‚Äôs okay pero a part of me feels shitty na baka one sided yung sakit. pero on the bright side, it helped me rin kasi mataas pride ko and if he‚Äôs okay then i should be doing okay too. the stalking is my way of getting my daily dose of him but it‚Äôs been really unhealthy. i stalk nalang kahit saan (fbi girly here). 

hearing about him from friends:
eto yung recently lang. my friends are hesitant to even mention his name to me at all because alam nila about us. they still have a genuinely close relationship kasi we met through them and im very happy na ganun parin. im happy na he‚Äôs still comfy na mag spill sakanila. recently, i found out they had a hangout where napagusapan nila yung about us. i don‚Äôt want to elaborate baka lurker pala friends ko here. long story short, i found out that he‚Äôs been having trouble with relapsing to the point na they made a bet. may consequence siya if he relapses. i found out na may time na he was close to messaging me. finding out this new information, my progress of moving on came crashing down. now i know were both suffering and it sucks kasi if both gusto ang isat isa makausap then bakit hindi pwede? i‚Äôm such a why girlie. i know it‚Äôs more complicated than that and honestly if we have both separate lives in opposite ends of the world then we simply cannot work. i have my new life here and he has his there. his life is there.  sometimes we just have to make sacrifices. i feel like i didn‚Äôt fight for it enough and i wonder if he‚Äôs feeling the same way. it makes me feel a little better knowing that i‚Äôm not feeling like shit alone and he‚Äôs feeling it too out there. the downside on my end is that i don‚Äôt have my friends w me physically to distract me and make me feel better. i‚Äôm the type of girl who‚Äôd talk about it over and over until i get over it. i feel bad for always bringing him up and i don‚Äôt want them to feel like they can‚Äôt talk to me about anything else bec all i talk about is the breakup. so i made this post. i wanted to give an update about how my breakup is doing but i don‚Äôt think my friends want to hear it anymore.

the new goal:
i‚Äôm trying to practice ‚Äúout of sight, out of mind‚Äù it‚Äôs really hard but i know i‚Äôll eventually get there. i need to stop hearing his name, hearing about his whereabouts, stalking him, etc. any form of him without blocking him. i know i can do it. maybe i‚Äôll update again when it‚Äôs been a few couple months.

Moving on...,"Basically, I ceased interacting with someone I liked a month ago. I was friendzoned and we decided to remain good friends kasi I realize that's how important she is to me. I was fine with it, kasi sabi niya di pa naman daw talaga siya ready.

Then recently, she started entertaining a suitor. They went on dates, had kisses, and sleepovers, and I was like, yeah I don't feel so good.

I know medyo selfish na on my part, pero I blocked her kasi yoko makita mga posts.

Ang di ko maintindihan is...I stalk her on a dummy account. I want to move on, I really do, but this toxic habit is preventing me.

TL;DR I blocked the person I like to avoid seeing lovey dovey posts with her new suitor but I'm stalking her on a different account. I need help to get out of this unhealthy habit.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/v2kb0z/moving_on/,t2_gyoa6ql1,2022-06-02 00:01:01,53
My Guy Bestfriend Confessed He Cheated,"Nagusap kami ng guy bestfriend ko about my past relationship and how I was blindsided. He related the conversation from his past where he cheated his ex girlfriend to his current one.

He confessed na nagdedate na sila ng current noong on the rocks sila ng ex niya. Things were going south na sa kanila ng ex which I believe kaya pang ayusin but my bestfriend chose to proceed sa babae niya ngayon. Pinagusapan nila na they have to be lowkey ng ilang months para may gap. He said, he was young and wanted to explore plus he fell out of love when her ex got needy and emotionally dependent lalo na nung time na namatay Dad ni ex girl.

When I brought up how my ex still stalking me, he also confessed na he keeps on checking his ex sa isang FB account niya and reacting to some of her posts out of guilt. He wished to have last convo with her. Tell her na walang mali kay ex girl kundi asshol lang talaga siya for betraying her.

I suggested na wag na siyang magreach out dahil nakita ko yung IG story ni ex niya na NGL answer about sa trauma niya sa guy best friend ko.

Now it all makes sense kung bakit ayaw sakin ng current girlfriend niya kahit di naman kami magkausap or nagkikita palagi nitong guy bestfriend ko. Takot sa sarili niyang multo.

Kaya sa mga nagbabalak or nangcheat, better think twice. Katulad nitong guy bestfriend ko na kinakain ng guilt na ilang taon na, gumagamit ng isa pang FB to get info sa ex at yung girlfriend niya ngayon na takot sa sarili niyang multo. You may seem happy sa socmed at long term kayo katulad nitong friend ko, pero you will never have peace in your relationship lalo na‚Äôt aware kayo na may ginago kayo

my boyfriend still attracted to other women at nakakasawa na punyeta,"my boyfriend and I are together for almost 2 years now. And since last year nasabi ko sakaniya na ayaw ko pinag aawayan ang mga babae kasi it ruins everything sa rs.


First: i saw his recently ig following na girls who posts sexy pictures (i have no against girls who posts picture na ganon, I'd support them pero kasi the fact na we are together, he is committed already, why pa-ganon? Na confront sya and he unfollowed those girls naman pero wtf parin, hindi parin sya nag babago.


Second: I always see sa ig nya in discovery/search tab na laging lumalabas puro baba na sexy pics eh algorithm yun na kung ano mostly navview mo o sinesearch mo lalabas dun.


Third: sa tiktok, i saw his watched history on tiktok there's this certain girl na pinanuod lahat ng tiktok niya kasi sumasayaw ng sexy... hindi rin ako against dun kasi marami talaga sa tiktok, hindi sana masakit kung famous yung girl pero hindi eh haha hindi naman famous yung girl he just stalked her to watch lahat ng video ng babae, as in lahat talaga. sympre some boys after watching those kind of vids eh ma-arouse talaga, u know whats next after that.

sawang sawa na ako, tangina micro/cheating na ba to, na he's attracted to other girls while having me, puta ako nga once committed hindi na ako naattract sa iba as in, lahat ng attention ko naka-tuon sakaniya at lust' ko. Masakit kasi hindi niya ako nirerespeto, yung feelings ko hindi nya nirerespeto, yung rs namin hindi niya nirerespeto and as days goes by alam ko hindi na same yung love ko for him. nakakasawa, paulit ulit. Hindi naman ako nagkulang, i send n* des pics when he asked and we vid ourselves, pero bakit sya ganon? puta addiction na yan eh, personality na nya talaga mag hanap ng ganong babae. Masakit sakin nafeel ko I wasn't enough, i wasn't attractive for him na kaya sya ganon. Na para bang while andito ako he‚Äôs gonna look for more na mas nabibigay yung pangangailangan nya sa lust, ang feeling ko parang i need to compete sa mga ganong babae para lang di na sya maattract sa iba.

Sobrang nahihiya ako especially sa mga nakakakilala sa atin na alam nilang may jowa kana pero yung mga nila-like mo puro ganyan. Ngayong break na tayo, saka ako nag stalk and nalaman ko yan.

Wala naman anywhere sa profile ko na nagsasabing ganun yung hanap ko. HAHAHA ibigsabihin that's what he thinks I deserve? He wants to better himself for me. Ang cute lang. I stalked his profile, feeling ko he's a few years younger than me. Early 20s and nag aaral pa.

Makakahanap pa yan ng dream girl nya na iba. Natuwa lang ako na ganun effect ko sa kanya, na that's how he see me. Kumbaga he feels na he's undeserving so he has to improve muna.

Nang dahil sa Instagram,"Before my boyfriend and I became official, I stalked his following on Instagram. He followed a lot of nude Instagram models and I managed to shrug it off, since hindi pa naman kami that time.

1-2 months into our relationship, I brought it up. He explained na it's what popped out of his feed when he was new to IG. A few weeks after, I noticed his following decreased. I clicked and saw he had unfollowed those models.

Pero earlier, I stalked his following again. He started following these kinds of models again. And it feels like a huge slap to the face because he knows how I'm still working on my insecurity issues, he knows how much I cried because of my low self esteem, and he knows that he's the only person I've ever dated because napakababa talaga ng tingin ko sa sarili ko.

Stop spreading your exes nudes!!,"This happened a few weeks ago so I talked to this guy I met on bumble and we we're talking na sa ig, we also played some games and blah blah.

Tapos inistalk ko si guy sa fb tapos nakita ko yung repost ng story memory niya, it was an anniversary gift from his ex with gift and them kissing tapos I saw the girl. she's very familiar!!! Siya yung nasa picture na sinend ni kuya. I stalked her and yep confirmed nga.

She also said to me na she'll file a report sa pinag tatrabahuhan ng guy sa states. So ayun I'm very happy na sinabi ko kay ate girl huhu.

Filipino virtual streamers and their hidden identities,"Are you guys familiar with this community? Where they're creating their own animated persona, who'll they use to stream online?
 
Onting background bago ko ikwento.
 
In early 2023, I started dating my now boyfriend. He has a virtual streamer ex, and I found out because I always stalk my boyfriend online. I saw his old posts and tags mentioning that streamer's screen name.
At first, I thought it was just her name, but when I noticed his shirt (apparently a merchandise shirt of that streamer) having the same name, I was curious, like, 'Who's this? His favorite anime? ' kaya sinearch ko na sya at lumabas is virtual streamer; it all adds up na lang if you're not dumb enough to comprehend na it's all just the same.. person.

As i said palagi ko nas-stalk boyfriend ko, kahit sa online games, and I saw na magka-squad pa din sila, of course, napa visit ako don.
¬†
Currently, there's no issue at all, but back then, it was so exhausting to love someone who came from a 4-year relationship and had a lot of reminders that she existed first in his life, so naiinis ako every time na may nakikita akong gamit na regalo nya, and ayoko rin gawin at puntahan yung mga memories na reused na. It felt like a competition, so I started to just appreciate myself more.
¬†
Months later, eto na nga, nag chat yung friend ni ex sa boyfriend ko, accusing me na dino-doxx ko daw tong ex nya, dahil may nag kakalat ata ng real identify nya¬†dahil daw nasa  ml visits ako, tapos may pinakita pa na Pinterest account, sabi ako daw yon HAHAHA so pinakita ko yung Pinterest ko wtf.
They didn't directly talk to me, so I tried to be the bigger person and reached out to clarify things, and it went well. Maayos sya kausap, mabait naman.
¬†
December 25 naging kami na, December 27 may nag chat nanaman sa boyfriend ko, which is yung ex na mismo saying the same thing, na I'm doxxing her daw, and napa wtf ako kasiiiiii akala ko ba okay na? Apparently, hindi pala sya tinigilan, and ako nanaman yung sinisisi.

her reason? My likes and reposts about how to deal with retroactive jealousy. HAHAHAHA.¬†
THIS GIRL STALKED ME AND CREATED AN ASSUMPTION BASED ON WHAT SHE SAW.
BRO, IF I COULD JUST SHARE HER CHATS HERE LIKE
""bakit gumigitna pa din ako sa inyo, matagal na kami wala, hindi kita kilala, mag move on ka na"" stuff. BWHAHAHAHAHAH
Bro, I was so shocked that time because I didn't know where she was coming from..
Sa point of view ko, nag repost ako, I'm having a good time with my life, friends, and him, I'm expressing my emotions then suddenly may ganong eksena AHAHAHA
i mean? Yeh sometimes nakakapag usap kami ng boyfriend ko about how i feel about his past na i hate the fact na she knows him well, stuff like that na hindi naman dapat ilabas na, sa amin na lang dalawa, tapos biglang mag-iinterfere si girl sa mga na fe-feel ko just because she thinks kinakalat ko identify nya HAAHAHAHA
Idk, it felt like I lost track sa pag-kwe-kwento pero kasi mukang ewan si girl. HAHAHAHAHAH

The LIP/gf of my boyfriend‚Äôs eldest brother might be cheating on him,"I need to get this off my chest because it‚Äôs bothering me whenever I see either his kuya or both (the kuya and the gf).

So, I have a boyfriend. He‚Äôs the youngest amongst the three siblings. His eldest brother has a girlfriend, like a live-in partner because the girl lives with him (at least, she gets home to the eldest brother‚Äôs house most of the time). The girl is an FA.

I‚Äôve always had a bad feeling about this girl even though I am the one who‚Äôs new to their family. I stay with my boyfriend and his mom at least 3-4x a week, so I get to meet and see his eldest brother kasi he lives nearby, like 3-5 mins away kasi different subdivision lang.

Just to note, the middle brother is married and has kids. The wife doesn‚Äôt bother me as much as this eldest brother‚Äôs gf.

Anyway, I stalked the gf. Faceook. Instagram. Tiktok. The gf is quite popular I must say? Because she has thousands of followers on Tiktok and Instagram. She has a dump account with a bio that has an initial like (Jü§ç). Then, when I stalked her Fb, I saw a guy from her facebook profile whose name starts with an J.

The J guy has a post on his Fb account, photos of him and the gf of the eldest. The photos had been posted last Christmas. The photos looked like they were on a date. It was at a nice restaurant in Makati. They were having steak. No kissing or anything, it looks like a normal post of a couple on a date night, except that in this case, the girl is the gf my bf‚Äôs eldest brother. The post says Merry Christmas and the gf of the eldest commented ‚ÄúMerry Christmas üòò‚Äù. 

My bf‚Äôs eldest brother (their whole fam) is nice and kind. I just have this feeling that she is cheating on him and nobody deserves that. To add, if you are going to check the girl‚Äôs social media accounts, she has not posted anything about the eldest brother, considering that they‚Äôve been together for at least 3 or 4 years and are living together. 

I shouldn‚Äôt be privy about their relationship but this is my boyfriend‚Äôs eldest brother. üò≠",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1b1kr6h/the_lipgf_of_my_boyfriends_eldest_brother_might/,t2_pazeb5xk1,2024-02-28 03:35:46,1

Approaching my 30s na SINGLE... Tanggapin ko na ba that I'm gonna grow old alone?,"These aug holidays, have been quiet. No dates, no hangout with friends, no ka flirty chats... just me. Also havent been scrolling a lot on socmed than usual... no more stalking sa ex... di ko na feel eh. So quiet, peaceful... yet sometimes so... lonely (?)

These nights when i dont have ka landian (hahaha!), as clich√© as it is, can't help but think, will anyone still love me? Will i ever feel that kind of high in love again? To feel at home with anyone? What happened? What was my contribution to that breakup? Panget ba talaga ako? Char!

AM I GOING TO START ACCEPTING THE FACT THAT IM GONNA GET OLD ALONE? hahaha Parang eto na nga yon.  Strong independent vibes na dba? Am i gonna start being okay with that? Cuz really... and honestly... my hopeless romantic heart, this Disney Princess... isn't. hahahahaha!!!!

Sometimes, i feel embarrassed with my strong independent friends... na kaya talaga nila alone.... na THEY CAN LIVE WITHOUT A MAN tlga. Kebs lang. I feel embarrassed cuz why cant i be like them? when in fact, I AM LIKE THEM... i mean, hello, nbsb for 26 years. ü§£ (been in a rs for 3yrs kaya 29 na ako now)

And yet, here I am... getting emotional accepting the fact na, im gonna be 30 next year and maybe... wala talaga. Maybe im gonna be like my cousins na strong independent women in their 30s... mga pretty and single. Happy lang.

This February baby... love month girl, has to accept na maybe ka barkada ko cla kris aquino and heart evangelista (tho she's with chiz) ... mga hopeless romantic girlies na wala eh, ganun cguro? Pero tangina, ang hirap tanggapin? ü•∫üò≠ HAHAHAHAHAHA",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/163jc38/approaching_my_30s_na_single_tanggapin_ko_na_ba/,t2_hc76q6n4,2023-08-28 19:17:47,59
Ang labo talaga hahaha,"So I'm still here currently at work, gusto ko lang naman sabihin na putang-- de joke lang hahahahaha. Ewan lang I'm supposed to do a first meet-up/date later 5:00 pm after my duty and her kakain sana ng dinner sa labas but hindi na tuloy hahahahahaha. 

Here's a little background: We matched on a dating app few days ago and then lumipat kami sa telegram ayun the casual usap usap muna getting to know each other and then okay naman kami sa chats then it transition sa lagi ng calls kami nag-uusap kasi hindi rin naman siya text/chat person mas bet nya daw phone calls and okay lang din naman sakin iyon. And then ayun nga okay naman kami lately like goods yung vibes namin sa calls or pag-naguusap kami ganto ganyan kaya feeling ko irl mag-jajive talaga kami sa company ng isa't isa so I decided to meet her up na agad (oo masyadong mabilis para sa iba but naramdaman ko naman kahit sa pag-uusap palang na ""goods kami neto IRL sa tingin ko"" and then going back tas she asked na what's my facebook account and ayun we added each other na yesterday thursday. So ayun syempre stalk stalk ako and siya, I find her okay naman physically and at my age bracket bonus nalang sakin yung physical appearance I mean yes wala naman nainlove agad sa ugali ng tao syempre physical attraction pa rin naman pero ayun nga sa edad kong ito (27 yo.) yung thinking ko is hindi sya big deal or mas mag-mamatter sakin yung personality ng tao at syempre praktikal lang kung may ibang pinag-kakaabalahan sa buhay ex. work etc. Ayun nga mas impt. for me kung swak ugali namin pareho, nag-eenjoy kami sa company ng isa't isa and we always meet in the middle. 

Then eto na, Today Friday kaninang morning nag-chat pako sa TG na good morning ingat ka sa work kumain ka na ba ganyan tas sumagot naman na nasa work na sya then andito nako sa work late nako nakabasa ng msg dahil toxic ang nature of work ko lol and ayun nga chineck ko phone ko (hoping na nag-follow up chats pa) but ufortunately waleyyyy HAHAHA eto pa malala buti sana kung ganon lang potangena mhie deleted yung buong convo HAHAHAHA dunno na may ganong kineme pala ang TG na pwedeng idelete kahit msgs ko akala ko kasi yung kanya lang pweds nya idelete lol. So sadly ayun na nga nangyari so one thing is for sure hindi ako pasok sa physical preferences nya (yung nag-stalk sya sa fb) but siztttt sorry hindi din naman sya pasok sa preferences ko physically üò≠ hahahaha talagang I'm happy pag nag-uusap kami and nagustohan ko yung energy nya kapag nag-uusap kami like I've said bonus na nga lang yung panlabas at mas nag-matter na talaga sakin yung the way kami mag-usap. So hindi ko na rin makita profile sa fb kapg sinearch ko inunfriend ako tas baka blocked na rin? Ewan. Sa TG di pa naman naka-blocked hahaha. Sa dating app naka-unmatched na din ako üôÉüòÇ 

Kaya ganyan ang title ""ang labo talaga"" kasi nag-uusap kami sa phone the other day mas importante daw sa kanya na kung mag-kiclick ugali irl wala naman daw sya preferences sa physical ganun una palang din sinabi ko na, na ilapag nya na agad preferences/standards nya for us to save each other's time and be matured enough nalang na if hindi pasok just say it straight na agad tas biglang boom! HAHAHAHA anyway, I'm not that ugly naman din alam ko sa sarili ko hahaha siguro 6-7/10 ganyan, skinny built, wears glasses, 5'4 ht, moreno, may stable na job may savings naman din, wala lang kotse HAHAHA planning palang kumuha ü•¥, marunong naman kumpletong sentences kapag nag-chachat, matured naman to handle such things sa relationship, di naman nag-dedemand ng time mo lalo na kung working ka kasi may other priorities din us in life, alam ko naman pano gamitin ang you're at your their they're were we're, may since of humor naman etc. Kaya ayun nalabuan lang ako HAHAHAHA na mas impt. naman daw sa kanya ay ganyan ganyan lol. Sayang naman pumorma pa naman ako today nilabas ko na yung pangmalakasan kong pormahan pati perfume charotttt HAHAHA pero yun nga napansin din ng mga ka-work ko yung isa ngang girl na kawork pogi ko raw today tas napapatitig kasi minsan lang nila ako makita na ganto sa work kaya alam nila may date ako hahahahahaha kasi alam ko naman paano ayusin sarili ko, to look presentable sa date hahahaha. Pero ayun nga mas okay na rin siguro kesa natuloy pa tas I might got stood up or biglang umalis in the middle iwan ganun hahahahaha. Diko alam if andito ka sa community na to pero gusto ko lang din kasi ilabas hahahaha.

Sorry mahaba ty sa pag-basa kung nakarating ka here. Tanggap ko ng mag-papastol nalang talaga ako ng tupa in life ü•≤üòÇ akala ko hahabol nako sa Feb. 14 kineme di pala, instead na truelove, truema pala nakuha HAHAHAHA. Ayun lang nais ko lang ilabas. Salamattttt!!! Ingat peeps!

so why,"Im a guy, so confused why I am being liked by gays sa kanto (no offense to the lgbt com). Pero tang ina walang class, every time na dadaan ako, kase yung supplier nmin is next to their salon, they keep calling me and eyeing on me, like pls stop. I have been sexually harrased na din multiple times by gays, dinakma by a gay brother of my classmate during jhs, hinila and hinawakan ng mahigpit sa braso ng mga gays kahit nasa bahay lang ako during a piyesta (saying sumama na daw ako, sakanila lang daw ako) and have been stalked on persistently kapag naglalakad ako, kaya nag fafake epilepsy ako kapag may nakakasalubong na gay. (also sorry for the those who have this disability) 

Actually di sya nakaka boost ng ego, nor I dont feel pogi, rather natatakot ako. Di naman lahat ng gays (just as how men are not the same stereotype) ganto pero bakit ako nakakaranas ng ganto. 

Also, in the other hand, I'm also being liked by minors and by some corporate working women na way older. Bakit walang ka age ko lang tang ina. Nakakafrustrate.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/17gupnt/so_why/,t2_lwawl0qq5,2023-10-26 19:52:32,81

She ruined my brother,"They were together for 5 years. Kuya, proposed last year. 
Called off the wedding two months ago. 

Last night, I stalked her soc med ( using a dummy account since she blocked me). She deleted all their photos na, and seemed to be in another country atm. Checked the comments and some of her friends were commenting/ hinting  why hindi daw niya pinopost yung new boylet niya which she replied ""wag muna baka kasi  madepress yung isa kawawa naman "" with laughing emojis

 T*NGINA MO, L. USER KA. I knew it, you've been cheating on my brother all this time. Pinagtatawanan mo pa sitwasyon ng kapatid ko. I so wanna get back at you  but I won't cause I know magagalit saken si kuya. Ang kapal ng face mo. Hindi mo ikinaganda ang pagiging two timer. 

I know he's not perfect but he did his best to keep her happy, was loyal to her, worked hard to give her wants,  gave her a home, supported her family even helped on paying for her sibling's  school. 
It's been over a month since kuya moved back but I still  don't have the heart to ask him what  really happened. Sabi ni tatay, he'll share naman once he's ready. Wag ko daw kulitin.
He's been drinking more than usual, gets triggered so easily even with small things ( he gets super angry when I would jokingly remind him to eat or take a shower), can't get a decent sleep so he would struggle to get out of bed. He's not the same person anymore. I've had my fair share of heartaches  but seeing him like this is just unbearable. 
I want my happy, makulit, matakaw kuya back :(

EDIT: Thank you guys for all your well wishes for my brother. I'm literally crying, idk why I'm so emotional. I read all your comments and thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è. 

I can't talk about this kasi with my friends cause I know that he trusts me not to, but it's just too heavy and I'm so bitter.  Seeing her post happy/carefree photos while my brother suffers. Like , b*tch I hope you choke on your b√°nh m√¨.

I am being patient because I know that moving on takes time.  And I will try my best not to be an annoying sister.

Papansin ang batugan na ex girlfriend ng boyfriend ko.,"I, 27/F, am in 10-month-relationship with my boyfriend (31). We're in a healthy relationship but his ex girlfriend keeps on getting on our way.

I just need to take off this from my chest and also soliciting your wisdom. 

I, 27/F, am in 10-month-relationship with my boyfriend (31). He came from a messy 3-year-relationship with an unemployed single mom. Live in sila previously and he played the role of being a father sa anak ng ex nya. Things became problematic for the both of them dahil sa financial problems and cheating issues ni girl. Si girl din ay ayaw sa kanya ng family niya for being palasagot sa parents ni bf, unemployed, and umaasa sa bf ko pati luho niya. I can feel it na sobrang minahal ng bf ko yung ex nya kasi lahat binigay nya. So they decided to end things up. Nakkwento rin sakin ng kasama sa bahay ng bf ko na nakakaaway nya mga trabahador ni bf. 

Naging 1 year single ang boyfriend ko before naging kami. I see it na maayos naman yung boyfriend ko and he reassures me a lot. We're currently living in on his parents' house. Things are smoothly sailing for us. Healthy relationship. Meanwhile si ex gf ay paiba iba ng jowa at currently single raw pero may may posts sya na may sinosoft launch syang love life. In short may kanya kanyang buhay na. 

However, yung anak ni ex gf din ay nagchachat from time to time sa bf ko reminding him of her bday and all that pero blinock rin sya ng bf ko kasi I said hindi ako comfortable. Parang feeling ko ginagamit ni girl ang anak nya para lumambot yung bf ko. Then few months later itong ex ng jowa ko biglang nagpost ng TikTok na appreciation video about how grateful he is for my bf for taking good care of them specially yung anak nya and he wishes him the best of luck. Si ex gf ay nakablock sa soc med ng bf ko. I showed the video to my bf and told him how uncomfortable I am sa post. Kinonfront ni bf ang ex nya to tell her leave him out of it. Nagreason out si girl na di naman talaga makikita yun not unless ini-stalk sya. She doesn't get the point pero my bf opted to block her after he said what he wanted to say. 

I can't stop stalking my bf's ex gf. Parang there's something I need to know. And at some point naiinsecure ako kasi presentable talaga ang datingan nya, friendly and manipulative daw sabi ng bf ko. Im afraid na baka pag nag usap sila madala ang bf ko. Though he reassures me na ayaw na nya dun. Feeling ko ang laban ko lang kay ate girl ay hindi fucked up ang family ko at I have my own money pang luho. 

NGAYON I LEARNED TO HATE HER KASI FEELING KO MAY HIDDEN AGENDA SIYA KASI WALA SIYANG LALAKE NGAYON.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/185r08g/papansin_ang_batugan_na_ex_girlfriend_ng/,t2_mnvun634c,2023-11-28 16:08:46,27
HI SAYO ATE NA NAGSUMBONG SA MAMA KO NA MAY BF AQ BEFORE CONGRATS PO FOR HAVING A BABY GIRL,"Context: super strict parents ko before and nung gr 10 aq i had a bf by secret then this girl who i dont know but was able to find my mother's acc and she chatted her para magsumbong. She keeps saying that she's concern for me and baka mapano aq if kmi lng dalawa ng bf ko. Literal na hnd ko kilala si ate girl pero alam ko ka batch ko siya sa school.

Its so creepy that this girl knows me so much pero i don't know her but i do have a feeling she's our neighbor or a friend of our neighbor kasi grabe nman effort mo pra magsumbong and grabe ka ate saya saya ko nun and makapag sumbong ka kla mo never naka experience ng love life :(( 

Then nalaman ko fb friend ko din pla siya so maybe she stalked me kaya ganun but that was 4 yrs ago. And kanina i saw her post about her baby girl but her bf wasn't present. I dont wanna assume that her bf wasn't a present father pero nakikita ko mga parinig niya sa fb before. 

Kaya dpat u should mind ur own business, i hope u and ur baby will be in good health always. Concern concern pang nalalaman pero bumalik din mga words mo for being pregnant and not being financially stable.

"If God permits, I do hope to meet you in person.","I have an online crush that I really like. This is the first time I felt this way for someone whom I haven't even met in person. I like his hobbies, his looks, him being smart and goal driven. He loves architectural photography. He loves coffee. He loves hiking. He loves sports. He's a pet lover. Reasons why I find him interesting and admirable. 

I want to know more about him. He actually inspires me to pursue my goals in life. It may sound creepy, but I have been stalking his instagram account for a month now. Every instagram stories he posted made my day. I'm actually refraining myself from sending him a message, as he may find it weird and creepy. 

I just realized I'm out of his league. I couldn't handle small conversations like the way he does. I don't have that much friends. I don't have hobbies aside from watching dramas. And I'm far behind in my career.

This is my way of letting this all out. As I will now stop stalking you on your social media account. This is my way of starting to fix myself first. I just hope that someday when I can finally carry myself confidently, I would be able to meet you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/10o5khv/if_god_permits_i_do_hope_to_meet_you_in_person/,t2_vo69zs19,2023-01-29 19:25:29,1

Ikaw parin ba? (2),"update to my last post about my crush. I just want to clarify that, siya parin talaga.

I haven't been thinking about him recently but then when I got bored ini-stalk ko talaga siya. Not until one day nakita ko na iba na bio niya and to the girl also. So naisip ko baka ano lang gusto lang magbio ng ibang thought or something pero nasagip parin sa isipan na ""ahh baka nag break na sila"". I don't want to think about something like that kasi parang I'm waiting for him and ayoko kasi talaga mag antay. Pero pagdating sa kanya ewan ko ba like I'm still waiting for him.

So last night someone followed me on instagram and guess what, siya yung nag follow sakin. I've been thinking delusional thoughts (what if's) baka want niya another love story haha chareng at baka lang naman gusto nya lang maging mutual kami (sana sa feelings din, dejklang). So ayun umabot ako ng madaling araw kaka overthink dahil dun. Baka lang naman napindot, pero ano eh 50 mins na siyang naka follow eh sino ba naman ako para hindi mag followback diba. Then I stalked his account and hindi kko na nakita yung highlights niya with his gf/ex?? and pati narin sa girl's highlights. (oh to have a friends na ina-update ka about your crush's life pati na rin sa highlights lol)

Ayoko talaga mag overthink. Pero what if tama instincts ko??",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/15jqa9c/ikaw_parin_ba_2/,t2_g7e4705s0,2023-08-06 21:57:19,1
I finally did it.,"Deactivated/deleted most of my socials and pulled the trigger on unfriending people who have deeply hurt me this year. Di rin naman ako naging santo sa kanila, not gonna deny that, but I‚Äôm done hurting myself by allowing the temptation to stalk them on social media to persist, knowing masasaktan lang ako sa makikita ko. It‚Äôs time I took care of myself for once.

Maybe in due time, some of us might reconnect, but for now, I have to focus on building a life beyond the shame, the regret, the heartbreak, even if that means losing access to them for now.

This will also be my way of honoring the good in those relationships: by learning to be a better person than I was with them, in every way.

"Never in my 19 years of being alive would I imagine that I would become the ""other woman""","For the context, I met this guy online, sa Omegle. 

Nagkasunduan and switched sa ig. Dun kami nag talk and sent some naughty pictures, also vcs din pala. Mga 2 or 3 times. He's from Pasay (22) and Im from Cebu. 

And since November till yesterday, we were still talking. But madalang na kami mag uusap, pero still nag uusap. Also we made a pact to tell each other na if ever may nagpoporma or may jowa na kami, tell daw para di na mag usap. Ay siya talaga una nag sabi na ""tell me if may jowa kana para di na kita e chachat"" ganun. Tas I also told him nalang na tell me also para di na ako mag bother sa pag chat sakaniya. 

Usually, mga hello, hi or kamusta yung mga chat nya. But still calling me baby and whatnot. 

Then, ayun. He slipped, nag story sya with a girl, and the next thing I knew di ko na makita story nya. Na hide na pala.

But i stalked and stalked that girl, tas yup, Di na ako masyadong nag memessage sa kanya. I just reply nalang. Until I've had enough, nag think ako na pano ang gf niya? If ever makita niya toh? Dba ang sama?


So, I made a dummy account sa tiktok and messaged her. And she asked for screenshots, which I delivered din. Almost 600 screenshots, from December till now. Di pa yun ano yung November na chats namin. 

But kaya pala December lang hiningi kasi December 14 lang din sila nagkilala, 1 day after my birthday, which that guy greeted haha. Tas that guy pursued her, but still messaging me.


Sabi nung gf, those times na nag chachat yung guy na sleepy sakin, he was with her. Wtf lang talaga.

Why are boys like this? 

When me and that guy met, I recently broke up with my ex din that time. November 1 kami nag break tas nag usap kami nung guy nung mga a week after or so bayun. But yeah, cheating was also the issue of our break up. 

Kaya I really took the courage and told her nalang talaga kasi I feel her pain. Being Oblivious is both a blessing and a curse. 

And yup, the end. We had a long convo about her ex too before that guy, she also got cheated before him. 

She was so sweet and pure. Nobody deserves to be treated that way.

BF liked his ex's picture on IG.,"My BF(24M) and I (23F) have been dating for 10 months. Recently, when I checked his ex's insta I noticed he liked her recently posted pictures. Hindi ako mahilig mang stalk sa ex nya because I trust him, but curiosity got the better of me.  Actually, they broke up on bad terms, so it came as a shock to me that he liked her pictures. Bakit pa? I wouldn't mind if it was a random girl's photo, but her ex? Ibang usapan na 'yan.

I felt disrespected. Nakaka-overthink and it's making me doubt him. Bare minimum naman siguro na if you're already in a relationship, then you should stop any form of communication or interaction na related to your ex diba? Respeto nalang sa current partner mo.

And if he wants to be with her then he's free to go.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1abbb2z/bf_liked_his_exs_picture_on_ig/,t2_ikfh8l9nk,2024-01-26 13:51:41,25
INUNBLOCK NA AKO NG EX KO,"So heres the story..

his ex and i talked about the things that has happened in the past. the girl was involve about our break up.  cinonfront ko sya,she knows na kinikita nya ex ko while we were in a relatioshp, pag ssend nya pics na unnecessary, etc etc

theres more into it pa pero di ko na eelaborate

and i figured he just unblocked me ata kahapon or this day. hindi ko maiwasan mag stalk before the day na inunblocked ako becoz bigla ko sya napapanaginip

i am wondering kasi the girl said she wants to block me for his mental peace daw and then ganun

I felt violated‚Ä¶,"I just wanna let this out..

I‚Äôve been here on reddit for almost a year now, and been posting anonymously since then. I‚Äôve been vocal about what I do for a living but not to the point kung saan exactly. Yes, I indicated my location on some of my posts, siguro yun lang ang mali ko. 

But I never expected that someone could track and know where I work, and surprisingly knew who am I personally. 

Since I found out about Reddit, this has been a safe space for me. Walang nakakakilala sakin. Yung mga nagiging kaibigan ko lang dito yung napag sasabihan ko kung sino ako at kung taga saan ako. 

I felt safe from then, not until now. I am even considering to deactivate nalang my account since now I know that someone could go an extra mile to track me, stalk me, and know personal things about me. 

To you, you already know who you are, I know mababasa mo ‚Äòto eventually; please never do that again. Stalking someone without their permission. Aside from invading my privacy, it kinda felt creepy. I know you have your reasons, I am trying to understand that. But please, never do that again. Not to me, nor to anybody. 

I felt my privacy was violated. So please, I am asking everyone to respect each other‚Äôs privacy. Never go an extra mile to violate them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/156g8hu/i_felt_violated/,t2_u9h4ujpx,2023-07-22 18:13:13,2
When you prioritize your peace,"hello ka omc! last year mga december or even january 2023 na, i‚Äôve been posting here tungkol sa mga hinanakit ko sa boohay and i have never been okay. i wanted to seek professional help bc i was not able to handle my emotions and my anger was consuming me.

and it was all because i keep stalking the ex of my ka situationship. i keep on seeing things that fucked up my mental health and my peace of mind. i kept worrying about being blinded and being lied to. i keep on worrying i might be treated the way i do not deserve.

but today, i can say na nandito na ako sa acceptance stage where i dont have to worry if people will lie to me or treat me like shit. i stopped stalking na rin and deleted my social medias. 

now, i prioritize my peace. (the girl keeps on following my twt even tho i declined na and i hate seeing her face lol) why would i put myself in a situation na natritrigger lang emotions ko at galit ko? 

what i did was i wrote all my anger, my frustrations, and my feelings in a notebook and it helped a lot. 

i would like to thank me, for prioritizing me and for choosing me <33",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/10falny/when_you_prioritize_your_peace/,t2_9z9r9a03,2023-01-18 23:49:10,1
2 years in a relationship with a poser,"way back 2015, meron akong text mate from cagayan de oro (daw) we literally update each other all day and night, magaan pakiramdam ko sa kanya, kwela sya ganon. without seeing each other personally, we became a couple for almost 2 years. we add each other thru fb and ig like that. until one day someone confronted me saying that my bf is actually a poser she dropped a name of a boy, and shalaaaa si bf yooonnn with a diff name. so poser nga. i confronted him he just said sorry and hindi pa daw sya handa mag pakita saken and i just said okay. since i am really happy that time na may nakakausap ako every day. (only child thingzzz).  fast forward.. after a year nanghingi ako pic sakanya kasi ang hirap may kausap ka araw araw pero di mo alam itsura nya?? i'm not into looks pero siss i need a facee na maiimagine or maiisip everytime!! so nag send sya.. okay he looks good.. but i doubted. what i did is that i stalk the girl who confronted me thru her followings sa ig. im not seeing any accounts na same dun sa pic na nisend ni wx boyfiee. until i saw the boy sa twitter!! what a coincidence!! i stalked him and i literally saw the pic na sinend nya!! i confronted him again!! and as usual, sorry di pako talaga handa. *okay*. i gave him another chance. out of nowhere he sent another pic again, di nako naniwala kasi sis super gwapo mala wattpad vibes, sinabayan kona lang sya. one time i searched ""famous persons in cdo"" and paaakkk!! i saw the pic again!! yung guy na ginamit nya is anak ng isang icon sa cdo haha imagine my frustration!! that's it i ended our relationship na. he is still nagpaparamdam after that hanggang sa someone texted me na na deds na daw yung kausap ko (di ako naniwala)

Jay, kung sino ka man nasan ka man haha i still wanted you to thank you haha sumaya naman ako all in all.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1892qbq/2_years_in_a_relationship_with_a_poser/,t2_oxg1o4obk,2023-12-02 20:29:18,0
My bf's ex cannot move on,"Me and my boyfriend have been together for almost 5 years already. We are in a happy and healthy relationship. 

Then comes his ex whom I accidentally found out was stalking me on socmed. Not just the ex but also the ex's friends. Nag start ito noong bago pa lang kami ni bf ko. Recently, I came across a profile on my suggested and I found it quite sketchy. I visited the profile and lo and behold, found out it's my partner's ex. May latest post sya sa profile nya ng photos taken from my partner's IG (landscape and food photos), with the caption reminiscing their past and how it should've been their nth year together. And other posts pa which I assume are about their past together. And other posts na parang patama sakin. Like wtf?! They have broken up 11 years ago ha. And it was my bf who broke up with her dahil daw napaka toxic and obsessive nya. The toxicity and unhealthy obsession which were confirmed by our friends. 

Then very recently din, this girl added my bf on facebook. Told my bf not to accept and to delete the request which he did. To make matters worse, a week after, a clothing shop added me on fb, checked out the profile and mutuals and found out it was owned by the ex. 

Not to brag, I'm very good at finding out things and connecting the dots with thorough research kaya nalaman ko na ex and friends ang involved. 

I am so mad kasi napaka disrespectful. I don't even know or understand what she's on about. Trying to stay relevant? Pati friends nya nag stalk sa ig stories ko lol. May closure sila but she cannot move on still. Parang gusto ko nang confront kung ano problema nya samin. Talked to my bf about this and sabi nya take the higher ground and ignore nalang daw cos he doesn't care about the ex and wala naman daw magagawa yung ex about it. 

Mag rant nalang ako dito kasi nakaka highblood yung pinaggagawa ng ex‚ÄºÔ∏è

EDIT: So ayun I chose to ignore nalang. Pero just now, yung friend ng ex bigla naman akong in-add sa fb. Nakakairita na tbh",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/11iq9hs/my_bfs_ex_cannot_move_on/,t2_ja6atqvc,2023-03-05 14:56:36,59
I feel bad for my crush ,"I don‚Äôt want to sound creepy pero I occasionally stalk yung threads account ng crush ko. 

We both work in the same building. Hindi kami same company pero mother company namin sila pero occasionally may mga collabd or need namin ng assistance from them sa mga projects kaya ko siya nakikita. Dami din naming interactions in the past. 

Kanina nakita ko na nagpost siya about sa pagiging single dad niya at kung gaano siya kalungkot.

I hope you‚Äôre okay. Things will get better, I promise you. I know what it feels like to pretend that everything is okay but feel empty inside. To feel as if it‚Äôs a never-ending cycle of disappointment and failure. I struggled with anxiety, depression, and OCD for years, but I still look for the beautiful things that life has to offer, and I know you will too. I hope you‚Äôll be kind to yourself because not everything is your fault. We are all just navigating life.

Because of love,"I know its bad and creepy to stalk someone especially my ex. But it is the only way that can ease my self to see her. But on day i got caught by her on the act and she blocked me on her socials. Because of this love, i broke her boundaries and did not respect that. And iam also shocked about what i made.

Kapal ng putanginang muka ng mga cheaters ano.,"Nahuli ko ex (M) ko na kasama officemate (F) nyang me gusto sa kanya pero me asawa magkasama sa mall. At kitang kita ko sa muka ng ex ko kung gano sya ka guilty na makita ako at nag try pa syang magtago sakin. I sent him goodbye text. He never reached out. 

I was in pain and hurting.. trying to move on kahit walang closure. 

1st week. View ng view si ex ng stories ko until i posted some story about karma.. afterviewing it. Iunfried ako tas i stalked his acct and saw that he posted a hard launch nung babae. 

I made a dummy acct para iinform yung husband ng babae na nagkikita sila nung ex ko. 

Nagaway at naghiwalay na sila

2 months after.. tumawag si ex. Gusto makipagkita at makipagusap. I said na wala na kaming dapat pagusapan pa Hindi naman daw sya ang me pakay kundi yung babae.. me gustong alamin at i confirm lang daw.. reply ko nalang na problema nyo na ang isat isa wag nyo na ako idamay then i hang up. 

Nanginig ako sa galit. Ginamit ko yung dummy acct to ask the ex husband ng balita kasi nangugulo sakin yung dalawa. Wala na daw syang pakielam at kakarmahin naman na yung dalawa sa ginawa nila. 

Tas nag message yung babae sakin.. telling me na tigilan ko na pagpapanggap sa acct nayun dahil alam na nyang ako yun. Pero wala daw akong karapatang gawin yun at sana sya nalang ang kinausap harapan. Gets nya na galit ako at me reason ako bat ko ginawa yun. Mabaet at wala siyang inagaw o sinulot.. galit na galit siya sakin pero pinapalabas nya sa message na kasalanan ko bakit agrabyado sya ngayon at iniintindi nya na lang ang feelings ko dahil sa nangyare. 

Ang kakapal ng muka.. ako na nga yung ginawang tanga at disrespected.. sakin pa magagalit.. kasi naunahan syang magmalinis sa ex husband nya. Ginagaslight pa ako na mabaet sya at tarantado ako. 

Sa ex ko.. napaka narcissitc mo.. puro kasinungalingang na pa victim ka nanaman para ma attract sayo ang lesser than you. Mamatay kang malungkot. Karmahin kayong dalawa. Magsama kayo.

omegle poser,"Medj mahaba mga sis, thanks na lang sa magbabasa hehe.

Met a dude from omegle and we became good friends. He didn‚Äôt tell me his full name which didn‚Äôt bother me since I respect his privacy or what not. Pero ayon, halos tumagal kami ng 1 year na magkausap and si Ate girl marupok na-fall. So I brought it up again and as expected he tried to avoid the conversation but I got mad at him. I told him that after all I shared with him he still didn‚Äôt trust me. 

Here comes the exciting part, the reason he told why he can‚Äôt say his last name is because‚Ä¶ *drum roll* anak daw siya sa labas ng isang sikat na politician. üíÄ WHICH YOUR GIRL BELIEVED BC SHE WAS DOWN BAD HAHAHAHAHAHA and idk isn‚Äôt that actually plausible? Na yung mga some people associated sa politics tend to wanna keep it lowkey or secret since things like‚Ä¶ the recent Ateneo incident may happen :// Someone please chika. 

Not long after, I stalked his crush‚Äôs instagram in hopes of finding clues about his identity but sadly it was private. Pangalanan na natin si ate gurl as Juliane. Luckily, I saw a suggested account full of dog pictures. Sabi ko, it looks like his twin sister‚Äôs dog. Plot twist, it was the same dog. I knew because I asked him for a pic of the dog telling him I miss it. The pic he sent me was the most recent pic in the ig account. 

Ang weird lang. He told me na may crush siya, due to stalking skills üëÄ ehe I managed to stalk the girl. Even had the same birthday as him. After finding out about that the dog his ‚Äútwin sister‚Äù has was the same dog Juliane has, I came to a realization na was Juliane the one I‚Äôve been talking to this whole time? ‚ÄúHe‚Äù did use to talk about ‚Äúhis sister‚Äù a lot, talked about her more than he talked about himself even. If you‚Äôre reading this Juliane, what the fuck?

This question has always been bugging me so please hear me out: It's about Snapchat or Instagram/Facebook/Messenger My Day stories and the dark side of it. (Trigger Warning ahead),"The original post in r/Cebu got removed so sayang kay the discussion was getting there.

This is a controversial topic. Please have an open mind.

**Is it considered stalking if you meet people on the go just because you saw their Snapchat stories (or location) or their My Day?**

Ever since Snapchat introduced the live map feature in June 2017, it had raised concerns of stalking and doxxing. However, millions of users continue to be unfazed by it, even flexing their locations for the fun (FOMO factor too) and openly inviting everyone to come and go to their open parties.

The same could be said for Instagram, Facebook, and Messenger stories. The purpose of these is to meet people on the go or if you happen to be in the same place at once unknowingly.

Here in Cebu, nakarinig ako ng mga experiences of people who ""bump"" or ""join"" parties na hindi kanilang groupo/barkada just because they saw them in the nightclubs that are open to anyone to join and they make it look like a coincidence na they so ""happened to be there at the same time.""

Others I heard would be polite to notify their friends/acquaintances ahead that imagining joiner sila kay sometimes ang maging flex2 nag party2 sa kanilang story ""**Come here guys, it's so fun!**"" (basically openly inviting anyone who is anyone to go there). During Sinulog, this awkwardness will be removed because everyone is your friend.

With that said, what do you guys think? Is it within the realm of acceptable to catch up on their location providing the place is an open entry like a nightclub? Or will it still be awkward or considered stalking?

I would like to hear your thoughts below.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/tbrlme/this_question_has_always_been_bugging_me_so/,t2_a1u1b6jf,2022-03-11 22:43:05,6
In love with a married man,"""If there's a price for rotten judgment, I guess I already won that.""

Although he's been separated for more or less six years, he is still legally binded to his wife. He has two daughters from his wife. I was able to find his wife's and daughters' names last month. They're not that difficult to find on social media. He refrains from talking about them. I'm dying to know about them from him and not from stalking them online. All I know is he doesn't see them anymore and continues to give child support financially.

In my heart, I want him to settle his marriage woes. I hope he gets to support his daughters more than in a financial way. I grew up mostly without my father because my parents separated when I was in grade school. It was in my adult years that I realized when the absence of my father's emotional support has affected my mental health.

It has come to a point that I stopped thinking about getting married because of him. I stopped dreaming about having a wedding. I could make that sacrifice to be with him. He is the first relationship I wanted to take seriously. It's just a bit tricky that he didn't have a history that was easy. At first glance, he seems to be far from the type I would go for. The more that I learn about him, the more that I notice that he is not that different from me.

My dear, I can't tell you out loud that I love you but I do in all senses. Explicitly and chronically.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1b6m260/in_love_with_a_married_man/,t2_uz70z7xgw,2024-03-05 05:01:06,0
