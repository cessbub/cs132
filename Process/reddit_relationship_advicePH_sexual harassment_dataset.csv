"i (25F) want to move out because my mother (46F) is physically, emotionally and mentally abusive and i need a safer space to heal. ","hi redditph! it’s my first time posting here but before i get this off my chest, i just wanna say i appreciate all of you here.

so, here goes. (TW: abuse, sexual harassment, suicide attempt)

short bg, i’m 25F and the eldest daughter of a broken family. parents are separated but both already have their own partners now. i have 2 younger brothers, aged 23 and 16. 

i’ve only been working for 2+ months because i graduated at 24. i never stopped school, i just transferred schools due to 3 separate incidents involving sexual assault, sexual harassment from a prof and theft by fraud. 

why am i telling you this? because it’s part of the reason why i want to move out—my mother did not offer me support in circumstances like these wherein i needed the counsel of a parent. 

she didn’t believe i was sexually assaulted by a classmate. she instead screamed at me and asked me if i was drunk when it happened, what i was wearing, and if the guy who assaulted me was my boyfriend. (did not drink, was wearing my uniform and the guy was bi—he had a bf and all.) i reported it to my former uni but also to no avail.

she never did anything about my prof who continuously harassed me for 2 years. i explained to her countless times that he kept asking me out to dinner and drinks, just me and him. he also keeps inviting me to chat through secret conversations in messenger. i never budged so he failed me on one of his classes. i lost my chance to be a dean’s lister because of him. she just shrugged it off like it was nothing.

although, she did something to my classmate/dormmate who failed to pay her share for rent that she borrowed from us. she had her blottered at 2 barangays. 

these are just a few examples of the challenges i faced in life. since then, i’m sad to say, i had to go through worse stuff and my mother still wasn’t there even after i reached out. 

apart from that, there’s also the pathological lying, violent tendencies and deep unresolved anger issues. 

lately i just realized she constantly lies about our family. she had been telling people that she paid for my tuition even if my dad did. (he rightfully deserves the credit.) the worst one was one time we were together and someone asked if i was her daughter, she denied it. 

there’s also the violence i can’t take anymore. whenever she gets upset with us while driving, she goes into a road rage. she speeds through highways to get her point across. she throws things at us and somehow i always get the brunt of it. the worst one happened last year and i finally had the courage to record it (sound recording). it was clear in the audio that she was hitting me while i was telling her it hurts. 

in 2014, i was diagnosed with major depressive disorder during my parents’ initial break up. in 2020, i relapsed and (shamefully & regretfully) tried to take my own life. now i even developed severe anxiety and a slight eating disorder. i’m only 38kg at 5’2”. 

there are still nights when i feel too overwhelmed. but i never went to my mother again. i’m more scared of hearing what she’ll say than of hearing my own last breath. 

i know that i make mistakes, sometimes it’s really my fault why she’s mad. i’m not the perfect daughter. i already constantly beat myself up for it—without them needing to add to it. 

but i finally see now that i don’t have to be perfect to be loved and cared for. i don’t deserve to be hurt anymore.

right now, my simple wish is to start my healing journey, far away from her. to have my own safe space, to establish new boundaries and to have a place to finally start living after being on survival mode for so long. 

i worry about my brothers but after i asked them, they confirmed that she never hit them, unlike me. and they know enough not to depend on her for emotional support. 

one of my brothers will be graduating and working soon too. but i promised my youngest brother that they both have the option to live with me if they wish. i only survived because of them. i want to give them a better life. 

but the thing is, even if my mother has been a great burden to my emotional, mental and physical wellbeing, she is still my mother. i still want to move out with her approval and blessing. i still want to support her financially and maybe when time comes, even more than that. because maybe i’m not the only one who needs therapy. i want to help her. when she’s ready too. 

me, i’m finally ready to put myself first. but how do i even start telling her that i’m moving out? do you have any advice for a situation like mine?

thanks, redditph! ❤️‍🩹",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/1armukf/i_25f_want_to_move_out_because_my_mother_46f_is/,t2_pid2dds1a,2024-02-16 02:48:15,1
I (27F) feel like the guy I’m dating (24M) is moving too fast and I’m uncomfy,"So I met this guy named Sasha (charot meme reference lang po) 😂 na meet ko siya sa bumble—we met, we clicked, we conquered. Kaya lang, masyado siyang mabilis for me! Parang sumali naman ng marathon si kuys.

By mabilis, I mean na nakapagsabi na siya ng “I love you” (one month pa lang kaming nag-uusap), naipakilala na niya ako sa parents niya and loved ones (again, one month pa lang kaming nag-uusap), and he’s also too touchy (ISANG BESES PA LANG KAMING NAGKITA NETO). I felt off kasi hinahawakan na yung hands ko and waist tapos nag-ask na siya for a kiss on the first date.

Masyado na bang palaban ang mga bagets ngayon? Nakakatakot 😔

Ang tanong ko is—normal lang ba talaga yan or napag-iwanan na ko ng panahon? btw hindi naman yung uncomfy na parang I felt sexually harassed ah! Nabibilisan nga lang ako tas di rin kasi ako sure pa na gusto ko na mag commit sa kanya pero parang sure na sure na kasi siya 😭 help",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/11wcmkj/i_27f_feel_like_the_guy_im_dating_24m_is_moving/,t2_7hlu6at6o,2023-03-20 16:08:55,7
i was a bad sister and i’m 100% sure it has greatly affected my younger sibling. what should we do?,"I (22F) don’t really have a great relationship with my younger (and only) sister (18F).

I was such a bully when we were younger, and nung nag-dalaga, sobrang bugnutin ko naman pagdating sakanya. Palaging naka-sigaw at bulyaw, palaging irita, and I am sure na ang laking epekto nun sa kapatid ko. Idagdag pa ‘yung parents namin na, according to her, ay masyadong overbearing. Hindi talaga maganda ang family dynamic namin—it’s like we’re all just roommates sharing the house. 

These past few months, she started opening up to our mom about her past experiences sa school: she was bullied from elementary, and was sexually harassed (and was bullied again) noong high school by her girl friends. She opened up about how she couldn’t forgive them, at gusto niya ma-earn ang respect nila by being an achiever ngayong SHS na siya. She wanted to prove them something to the point na hindi na healthy for her mental health. Hindi raw niya makalimutan lahat ng mga nangyari sakanya—mga nagawa ko, ng mga magulang namin, at ng mga so called friends niya. Para raw siyang mababaliw. 

Hindi na namin alam ng nanay ko kung paano siya mabibigyan ng advice. She kept asking me paano ginawa ko since I experienced the same things as well, but tbh ‘di ko rin alam sasabihin. We don’t know how to help her cope or process her emotions.

Napatawad na raw niya parents namin, I have apologized to her many times na rin, pero naiisip at naiisip pa rin daw niya palagi.

Aside from seeking professional help (we suggested magpa-check na siya pero ayaw niya pa), what should we do? Paano nga ba talaga magsisimula ‘pag ganito?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/11okmoo/i_was_a_bad_sister_and_im_100_sure_it_has_greatly/,t2_in4vsafv,2023-03-11 21:47:57,3
Bigla sya nagbago after a trip. hindi kona sya kilala and he’s nit the same person I agreed to be with.,"I’ve(F21) have been with my boyfriend (M23) for 2yrs now and have known him for 3. he’s a really caring bf and helps with house chores which I appreciate a lot. I’ve dealt with sexual harassment before and he still accepts me. I thought he was the one. but recently we went to a trip with my cousins (M25 and F23) while waiting for the train my F cousin was sitting on her luggage and my ‘bf’ was squatting in front of her(she was wearing a mini skirt and he was basically eye level to her thighs also it was kinda close 2 people could stand in between them) and when we talked abt it he said he didn’t do it on purpose so I just brushed it off. and then the first day of the trip I caught a fever so I went ahead and slept (it was like 6/7pm already) but I woke up because they were talking and I heard my cousins wanted to go out but was worried about me. then what surprised me was my bf was pushing for the three of them to just go because ‘she’s not gonna wake up anyway we should just go’ but my cousins made him stay with me and he was upset by it. but it hurt cuz I didn’t expect that he could leave me im that state he usually takes care of me when im sick. we talked about it and he denied wanting to leave me at first because he didn’t know I heard the whole conversation. but when I was telling him the exact words he said then he said sorry and thought I was just tired. but that’s not possible because he was with me the whole time and he saw how much my nose and eyes were watering from the abrupt changes of temperature. then in the morning I want to get our charger from him then I saw in his screen ‘ear licking asmr’ and ‘tongue flicking asmr’ I was so overwhelmed because in the 3 years I’ve known him this was the first time i saw it. (that same day in the bus ride home he watched it again btw) so I was just silent the whole trip just thinking. until we argued because he was getting lost in the crowd and we wanted to check out some stores that we pass by (its a big city plus we had a bus to catch later on so we had to stick together) I was so mad I told him ‘wtf we’ve been calling you’ and he screamed ‘what’s wrong with ur attitude’ and after that I just shut down and went to the corner. I was so embarrassed to my cousins that they had to see that. and so Im thinking about breaking up I just don’t know who he is anymore he’s I don’t know if I can trust him since he kept the ‘asmr stuff from me but my best friend is telling me that since its our first long trip together we were bound to argue and that we could still fix it she also told me that there’s not that much men who help with chores and are clean and I also know that he’s not a bad person and he is good bf material in general I think I just have to spell it out to him specifically what he needs to do which is bad cuz I feel like Im just maneuvering him. Im tired is this matter worth forgiving? is it worth fixing?I really don’t know what to do please help

to add more details we called after the trip since we lived far apart he told me he was sorry about blowing up on me about the attitude thing he said he was just tired. he told me that he was upset because he also felt  like I was a different person since I wouldn’t kiss him or do pda (out of respect for my cousins who their significant others weren’t present) the most Id do was hold his hand when my cousins were in front of us. I did tell him in advance about the no pda stuff because my cousins requested for it. and that im mainly inviting him so my M cousins has someone to bond with because he is waay hyper and too full of energy its hard to keep up so he was well informed about that matter.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/1ajm2j0/bigla_sya_nagbago_after_a_trip_hindi_kona_sya/,t2_d568t1qf,2024-02-06 01:27:20,1
Found something while online stalking my boyfriend's ex's social media and don't know what to do about it,"TW // mentions of sexual assault, minor mentions of suicide

This was already posted in r/Advice, just need as much advice as I can get. 

I've been incredibly torn on what to do about this for a few weeks now and really need some sort of advice. 

I (21F) have been with my boyfriend (22M) for around a year. I am incredibly nosey and, though I have no fears in my relationship, occasionally stalk my boyfriend's ex's (22F) social media accounts. Recently, I found my way onto her Facebook page. I scrolled a bit and found a post from a few months ago that has me incredibly freaked out. It was a post from some months back saying that on that day one year ago, my now boyfriend had sexually assaulted her. They had broken up just a few months before but were still living together at the time. No details were given on what happened so that's basically all I know about the alleged assault.

I have always thought of myself as someone who would immediately end a relationship if my partner were accused of something like this, but I have what I think is fair reason to be suspicious of these claims. 

After a few months of bf and I being together, ex messaged and told him she wants to get back together. Throughout their relationship, she was incredibly mentally abusive and controlling, causing him to have no life outside of their relationship because she wouldn't let him. He declined to get back together and she lost her mind. This lead to months of stalking and harassment from her. For the next few months, her attempts to get him to take her back include:

• Showing up to his house multiple times unannounced until he had to threaten calling the police so she would leave. 

• Messaging his friends and family to ask them to try and convince him to take her back. 

• Multiple threats on her own life, including holding a knife to her throat when she found out he was so much as in the talking stage with me.

• Spam calling him and spam messaging him on every platform constantly, even when she got no response.

• After he finally blocked her, showing up at his job to confront him.

All of these incidents happened many months after the alleged assault. He had finally blocked her 3 months before she made the post about the assault. Taking all of this into account, I don't think it's crazy to wonder if the post was some way to get back at him for not taking her back. I don't want to jump to any conclusions, I think I'm just terrified of what he'll say when I talk to him about it. The absolute best case scenario is that he didn't do it, but if that is true, that means there is still a post out there accusing him of something so horrific. There is no good outcome in the conversation, as the worst case scenario just means he DID assault her. 

I'm not worried about how he'll feel about me finding the post (I am incredibly open with him and he knows that I stalk her accounts on occasion), I just am scared for what the outcome will be. It's so easy to say this, but I cannot imagine him assaulting someone. He has never been anywhere near pushy when it comes to sex, and I cannot fathom the possibility that he might've assaulted someone. 

Everything I detailed about the he endured throughout their relationship or the time she was stalking him I was either there for or have been shown proof of, so I have no reason to doubt that. 

I just don't know where to go from here. He's noticed me being very upset and panicked recently but I've told him I can't talk about it yet. I promised that I will bring it up though, because regardless of the truth, it isn't fair for me to not share what I know. The part of me that has been assaulted myself is mad at me for doubting her story, but the part of me that was there for her stalking/harassment and knows him well is still so skeptical of everything.

I just need some honest advice on if my logic makes sense and how to confront him with this, please. Thank you for reading. 


This is my first Reddit post and I don't know how it works yet, I am just hoping this post doesn't get too much attention so that I can make sure it isn't found by any involved parties. Just need advice from a few people please.

TL;DR Found post saying boyfriend assaulted his abusive and obsessive ex and don't know what to do or believe.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/13hr5gl/found_something_while_online_stalking_my/,t2_nbn8e26e,2023-05-15 07:41:52,6
"A guy [24m] I [26f] dated hid a girl from me... the entire time. I still feel sad even tho rationally, it's not my loss","Posting this here as well, after posting on r/relationship_advice, just so I can get advice from people who understand my culture. I'll make this as short as possible, pardon the details. I'm just feeling sad. Matched with my old university schoolmate (we're both done with college, tho) on Bumble back in October 2022. I'm two years his senior in terms of school \[levels\]. Hm, we hit it off since his high school busmate was in the same course/college classes with me. We also had a bunch of other mutual friends, around 20-30? Anyway hm, he started flirting with me, sending me food/money when I was hungry. Invited me over to his apartment and we had sex (tho, I was uncomfortable and he was kind of pushy with it, this wasnt the only time he was, too tired to recount the other times). We established ourselves as FWBs and I figured, why not since he says he doesnt fuck around a lot. My mom is an Asian/Filipino helicopter mom (and I'm the eldest child, both girls), so I mentioned in passing he meet my parents so they wont look for me at night. My platonic male friends always come over too, and its all chill. So he got along well with my parents but lied about how we met (said we met thru my coworkers, one of which he also went to high school with but that's not true since they're not friends). I shrugged it off since it was a white lie. We went out to watch a movie and he bought my parents wine and food without me asking. My dad wondered why he gave them a gift since we're supposedly just friends. I shrugged it off. It went on like that til January. We'd have sex while high, sex while listening to K-R&B, go out on fancy restaurant dinners, hold hands. My mom supported our unlabeled thing and encouraged us to book AirBnbs and go on vacations abroad, even told me to meet his family and move to the States with them (at this point I feel like my mom just wants both of us to move out of our parents' house). It was all good. He didnt meet my mom just once, he was even supposed to go out and eat at his favorite restaurant with my dad (since that was his favorite restaurant too). He cooked for me, we'd have video sex while he was abroad, I'd listen to him crying about his family, talk every day, basically we liked each other. 4 months in, February, it was weird because he wasnt replying for a day, he usually texts me good morning every day. I wondered why, but paid for his new glasses via credit card anyway, since I broke the frames last time we had sex (accidentally sat on it since he left it near the pillow). He finally replied, said thank you that I paid, then said he just booked an AirBnb with his female best friend and was about to head out for brunch. I sensed something weird but shrugged it off, tho one of my friends egged me to confront him about it. So I confronted him nicely. That was when he started getting passive-aggressive about me prying into his private life. He said he was tired of explaining to people they were really just friends, and later that night, he blocked me. I was devastated enough to message our old schoolmates/friends and asked for help. One of them told me the truth and said he wasnt hanging out with that female best friend of his, but another girl he's been in a situationship with since March 2022. So he was lying the whole time lol. The last time I saw him, he was firm with his lie. Old friends/uni schoolmates confronted him without me asking, since apparently he used an acquaintance's name to tell the other girl he met me at this acquaintance's house party instead of a dating app. They asked the other girl about me, and she still believes the lie that I met him at a house party, and is downplaying his bad behavior. When they confronted him, he claimed that I was crazy, forced myself on him, and sexually harassed him. (That was weird and initially upsetting to me because, I never touched his genitals without consent and he touched mine without consent. I was so upset I called him up to confront him about that. After apologizing via text to my parents since they didnt want to talk to him, he blocked me everywhere again).

Well, that was a lot and I'm thankful I'm blocked since he was dramatic, toxic, and had a big ego (said I'm the hottest person he's ever been with and now I'm the crazy one). He also uhhh... lies to my mom about certain things just to impress her (my mom confronted him about this). If youre wondering why he met my parents, it's an old Filipino rule, for a guy to meet parents (Google: ligaw culture) and my mom still strictly adheres to that on top of being careful with her daughters, which is kind of weird but what can I do?

I'm trying to move on (it's been around 20 days since I found out the truth), but I guess my sole dilemma now is: the other girl's still staying with him despite others telling her about me. I can't figure out why. Was it something I lacked? It's irrational, but to be direct as possible, I can't help but feel sad about why he chose her over me. I know I'm supposed to feel bad for her, because I know he wont stop entertaining other girls with me, but I cant help but feel sad..? Maybe he liked her enough to tell her  I was going out with him but not the other way around? I dont know. I just feel weird that she's overlooking his flaws, even tho that's none of my business. Am thinking of speaking to my old therapist, but I guess I was upset enough to post this on reddit in the meantime. Any advice? Do liars like him change, or did I dodge a bullet (unlike the other girl)? He was honestly cute, and we genuinely liked each other. 

&#x200B;

TLDR: Guy lied to me the whole time, and stayed with the other girl. I know it's not my loss since he lied to her too, but I can't help but feel sad that he chose her",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/11rss1d/a_guy_24m_i_26f_dated_hid_a_girl_from_me_the/,t2_w6qnimlg,2023-03-15 18:46:23,3
